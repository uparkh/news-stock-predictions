        "article_content": "The US economy is on solid footing right now.\nEconomists at Bank of America expect it to stay that way through next year.\nIn a research note released to reporters on Monday, BofA's economics team led by Claudio Irigoyen projected the US economy will grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than current forecasts for 2% growth, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.\nThis comes despite uncertainties surrounding the economic policies of President-elect Donald Trump, including campaign promises of tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigration, which economists have viewed as inflationary.\nThose proposals could also hinder economic growth and pressure an already bloated federal deficit, further complicating the Federal Reserve's path forward for interest rates.\nHigher rates, coupled with a hawkish tariff policy, would strengthen the US dollar and create spillover effects to global financial conditions, representing \"a major shock, not only for the US economy but the rest of the world,\" according to BofA.\nBut there's one important caveat: The US is best prepared to weather any economic storm that follows Trump's agenda.\n\"We like to say that the US imports a lot of stuff, but it doesn't import recessions,\" Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America, told Yahoo Finance in a separate press briefing on Monday. \"It only exports recessions.\"\nBhave added any shifts in US trade policy \"would pose greater risks to the rest of the world than to the US\" due to the economy's resiliency compared to other developed nations.\nRecent domestic growth trends have been \"remarkable,\" in Bhave's view, and the proof is in the data.\nConsumer confidence is at its highest level in 18 months. US economic output hasn't been this strong since April 2022. Retail sales topped estimates for the month of October, the unemployment rate continues to hover at around 4%, and inflation has moderated despite its bumpy path down to 2%. \n\"The world right now is one in which the US economy has consistently outperformed [for] almost two years,\" Bhave said. \"Europe is struggling, China is struggling, so the US is going into any potential disruption to trade policy on much more solid footing than Europe and China are. I think that fact wouldn't be lost on the incoming administration either.\"\nTariffs, in particular, have been one of the most talked-about promises of Trump's campaign. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.\nShould countries retaliate with their own duties, a resulting \"tit-for-tat\" trade war could keep inflation elevated over the long term.\nBofA does not anticipate that scenario playing out, however, noting its \"baseline scenario is for tariffs on China and elsewhere,\" and that it expects the levies \"to be less\" than what's been promised.\nThe firm is \"moderately optimistic a full blown trade war can be avoided.\"\nOverall, \"tariffs can be very disruptive in terms of capital expenditures [and] obviously exports,\" Bhave said.\nBut given the US imports more goods and services from those countries than it exports, \"just by definition, the tariffs pose a much greater threat to those regions than to the US,\" Bhave added.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "As part of her broader economic proposals, Vice President Kamala Harris rolled out her “Opportunity Economy” agenda on Aug. 16, which she also touted during the Sept. 10 presidential debate.\n“I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy,” Harris said during the debate. The agenda tackles a wide range of economic issues, such as housing, lowering the cost of drugs and groceries, and tax breaks.\nRead Next: 5 Things You Should Stop Wasting Money on If Kamala Harris Wins in November, According to Experts\nFor You: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nHere is what her “Opportunity Economy” plan could look like.\nAlso see the 10 U.S. metros where Harris’ $25,000 down payment proposal would go the furthest for first-time homebuyers.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nHarris said that Americans earning under $400,000 a year would not pay more in new taxes if she were elected, according to a press release.\nIn terms of specific tax breaks, she said she would plan to expand the Child Tax Credit with up to $3,600 per child. She also proposed a new $6,000 child tax credit for families with children in the first year of life.\nIn addition, she’s offered to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. The expansion would cover individuals and couples in lower-income jobs, cutting their taxes by up to $1,500.\nShe also intends to cut taxes to help Americans who are buying insurance via the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Doing so would help Americans save “an average of $700 on their health insurance premiums, totaling over $6,000 per year in savings,” according to the release.\nCheck Out: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: Here’s What That Would Mean for the Economy and Your Wallet\nIn terms of housing assistance, Harris’ proposal includes up to $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, “with more generous support for first-generation homeowners,” according to her campaign website.\nIn addition, she has proposed lowering rents by “taking on corporate and major landlords,” according to the release.\nFinally, if elected, she also intends to call on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act, which would reduce the ability of large investors to buy “in bulk” rental homes — a practice that lowers supply and hikes up prices.\nAs part of her Opportunity Economy agenda, Harris intends to trigger 25 million new business applications by the end of her first term, should she be elected. To that end, she wants to expand the startup expense tax deduction, according to her campaign website.\nHarris also has plans to “increase the share of federal contract dollars going to small businesses.”\n“As President, she will direct her Administration to crack down on anti-competitive practices that let big corporations jack up prices and undermine the competition that allows all businesses to thrive while keeping prices low for consumers,” according to Harris’ campaign website. To achieve this, Harris has proposed extending the cap on the cost of insulin and prescription drug prices to all Americans.\nIn terms of lowering grocery prices, Harris said she would plan to go “after bad actors to bring down Americans’ grocery costs and keep inflation in check,” per the press release. To that end, she’s proposed implementing a federal ban on price gouging food and imposing penalties on companies that don’t abide by the rules.\nHarris’ agenda also includes providing more access to affordable child care and long-term care.\nAs part of that, Harris plans to expand “high-quality home care services for seniors and people with disabilities” and ensure that “hardworking families can afford high-quality child care,” according to her website.\nIf Harris were to be elected, she plans to continue building on the work she has done with President Biden, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the American Rescue Plan. These programs, according to her campaign website, have “supported more than 60,000 infrastructure projects, spurred more than $900 billion in private sector investments, and doubled investments in construction of new manufacturing facilities.”\nIn addition, Harris said she would support innovation in sectors such as semiconductors, clean energy and artificial intelligence.\nHarris’ website claims that she knows “unions are the backbone of the middle class.” In turn, she plans to sign pro-union legislation, “including the PRO Act to support workers who choose to organize and bargain and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act to make the freedom for public service workers to form unions the law of the land.”\nFinally, she also said she would work to raise the minimum wage, implement paid family and medical leave, and end taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.\nIn terms of education, Harris said that she would lower costs for child care and preschool, as well as continue to work to “end the unreasonable burden of student loan debt and fight to make higher education more affordable, so that college can be a ticket to the middle class,” according to her website.\nMark Friedlich, Esq., CPA, the vice president of government affairs at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, said that this agenda is based on the positions Harris and her campaign took during the debate and also incorporates proposals included in Biden’s budget released earlier this year that Harris has supported.\n“Details of the ‘opportunity economy’ will evolve, and the implementation of many of her proposals will require congressional approval,” he said. Friedlich added that these might encounter some implementation challenges, such as securing bipartisan support for major policy changes and balancing increased government spending with concerns about the national debt.\nIn addition, he noted that this agenda might encounter resistance from large corporations and high-income individuals facing tax increases. Additional challenges, he said, might be coordinating federal, state and local efforts for nationwide implementation, as well as ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across diverse communities and geographic regions.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "Investors are increasingly confident the US economy will achieve a \"soft landing,\" a scenario in which higher interest rates lead to lower inflation without a major hit to economic growth.\nOn the surface, it appears all signs point to that outcome. Inflation has eased. The economy is still expanding. Consumer confidence has risen. Retail sales are healthy. Corporate profits remain strong. And stocks continue to hover at record highs, with the Federal Reserve on tap to cut interest rates as soon as its next meeting on Sept. 18.\nBut one strategist warned on Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast that there are cracks under the surface.\n\"We're skating on ice that's a bit thinner than a lot of people presume,\" said Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners.\nDarda pointed to a rising unemployment rate and elevated earnings expectations, both of which contributed to the stock market routs seen at the start of August and September.\n\"It's not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,\" he said. \"That's sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.\"\n\"But there's been some cracks in the business cycle,\" he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at \"super high\" levels.\nTo that point, the S&P 500 shed 2% on Tuesday, dragged down by the tech sector after Nvidia (NVDA) earnings didn't deliver enough of a beat to satiate investors' appetites. Stocks seesawed in the subsequent days as markets struggled to find their footing following the sell-off.\n\"What's unfolding now actually makes a lot of sense to me,\" Darda said of the pullback. \"We're seeing companies that had been soaring off of repeated beats on either revenues or earnings not do so well in this most recent period.\"\nThe recent drawdowns point to how the current market — one in which investors consistently chase hot stocks and hot areas like artificial intelligence — can be a \"dangerous\" game, according to Darda.\n\"What that tells me is that the expectations have just gone up so much. It's impossible to beat expectations indefinitely. Eventually, they’ll catch up,\" he said. \"We're in a bit of a frenzy here. And if things start to go wrong, whether it's the earnings not living up to expectations or the business cycle faltering, that's when you see stock markets roll over in potentially a material fashion.\"\nBut it hasn't just been earnings. The jobs market is also telling a particular story.\nLast month, the July jobs report spooked markets after unemployment unexpectedly rose to 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The move higher also triggered a closely watched recession indicator known as the Sahm Rule.\nThe rule, which has accurately predicted recessions 100% of the time since the early 1970s, measures the three-month average of the national unemployment rate against the previous 12-month low. It's triggered when unemployment rises 0.5% from that level.\nTraders instantly panicked that the economy was slowing more than anticipated. But then the debate ensued: Why was unemployment suddenly seeing an uptick?\nEconomists and strategists began to lay out the possible scenarios, including a theory that above-trend immigration is driving up labor force participation rates, therefore pressuring unemployment as more workers enter the jobs market. This eased investor fears as stocks rebounded to finish August with wins across all three major indexes.\nBut Darda said the rise in unemployment is still \"a bit concerning.\" And he's not completely sold on recent bullish commentary that higher unemployment doesn't really matter as long as the economy keeps growing.\n\"4.3% is still an incredibly low unemployment rate level that looks quite good in the historical context,\" he explained. \"The problem, if there's a problem, is that we're up to 4.3% from a cyclical trough of 3.4%.\"\n\"Those kinds of movements and the level tell us that the economy, if it's still growing, is growing below trend or below the growth rate of potential,\" he said. \"There's an exceptionally fine line between that and an actual recession.\"\nOn Friday, investors digested another update on the jobs market, with the August nonfarm payroll report showing a slight decrease in the unemployment rate to 4.2%.\nMarkets pared earlier losses in the wake of the release, but history suggests stocks will continue to be volatile in the weeks and months ahead.\n\"I do think we're probably in an environment now where volatility is going to stay elevated,\" Darda surmised. \"The risk of a more material pullback and/or correction is quite high.\"\nUltimately, his view is one of caution: \"With what we saw for the last two years with this market backdrop, from these valuation levels, and based on where I think we are in the business cycle, I think we're going to be in choppy waters for a little bit.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "The US economy is no longer shocking Wall Street to the upside.\nEconomic consensus has shifted from forecasters chasing the data higher to scaling back levels of optimism as recent data shows activity cooling across a variety of metrics.\nThis has dampened hopes that economic growth could unexpectedly accelerate for a second straight year. \n\"I am having trouble getting too excited about the economy,\" Renaissance Macro head of economic research Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\"Conditions are fine, but I would hardly describe the situation as consistent with a meaningful acceleration.\"\nThe economics research team at Goldman Sachs, led by Jan Hatzius, has been among the most bullish on the state of the economy over the past year. But the firm moved down its estimate for second quarter GDP to reflect an annualized growth rate of 2.7% from 3.2% on May 24 amid \"weak spending momentum to start the quarter.\"\nSimilarly, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker — which uses data inputs from throughout the quarter to extrapolate how GDP is pacing — has moved down to 1.8% after sitting above 4% at the beginning of May.\nDutta's Monday note followed a new reading of activity in the manufacturing sector from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which showed activity fell further into contraction last month.\nThe ISM's manufacturing PMI registered a reading of 48.7 in May, down from a reading of 49.2 and lower than the 49.5 economists expected, according to Bloomberg data.\nAfter entering expansion territory with a reading above 50 in March for the first time since 2022, the index has declined for the last two months.\n\"The drop in the ISM manufacturing index in May adds to the sense that the economy is losing momentum,\" Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote in a note to clients.\nThe fall in PMIs is the latest economic data point to come in weaker than expected.\nIn early May, the April jobs report showed US job growth came in weaker than expected as the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked higher. A softer-than-projected reading on retail sales in April followed this report. In late May, a decline in the second estimate of first quarter economic growth was largely driven by lower consumption.\nThe stock market has taken any signs of a weakening economy in stride, with all three major indexes hitting record highs in May.\nThe correlation between the Citi Economic Surprise index and the S&P 500 has been inching toward a negative correlation, meaning stock investors have been increasingly embracing bad economic news as good news for stocks.\nMany view the current economic data as opening the door for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts while not signaling an outright downturn in economic activity. Lower rates and slower growth could still be a constructive environment for stocks.\nFollowing the weak April jobs report, for instance, the S&P 500 rallied about 1.3%.\nBank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note on Monday that whether economic growth deteriorates further will be key, as \"bad news can turn into bad news\" for stocks too.\nThe next test for this narrative will come on Friday with the release of the May jobs report.\nThe report is expected to show 185,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 3.9%, according to data from Bloomberg.\nKwon believes a print like this would keep the labor market tracking in the \"Goldilocks\" range — not too hot to fuel fears of sticky inflation and not too cold to heighten worries of a slowdown.\nWith inflation still tracking lower, many Wall Street strategists also see room for stocks to rally if a slowing economy proves to be a head fake.\n\"Stronger growth should also be positive for stocks,\" Kwon said.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nThe better-than-expected September jobs report put an exclamation point on a trend that's been underway for the better part of two months now.\nUS growth data is once again surprising to the upside.\n\"Forget soft landing, maybe we're having no landing,\" Interactive Brokers chief market strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. \"That's what this jobs report may be telling us.\"\nFor investors who have closely followed the economic narrative over the past several years, this should all feel a bit familiar. Just as consensus believed the US economy was finally slowing to the point where it needed help from the Federal Reserve, the data says otherwise. Escalating fears of a \"hard landing,\" where the Fed's restrictive interest rates send the economy into a tailspin, have quickly moved to discussion about a \"no landing,\" where the economy keeps growing and inflation risks once again emerge.\nThis brings to mind the defining phrase of the surprisingly strong 2023 economy and all the caveats that come with it.\nIndeed, we are, once again, so back. Back to a time headlined by calls for strength in the stock market as the Fed cuts interest rates while the economy remains on solid footing. Back to a time when good economic news is \"good news\" for stocks. \nBut it's a delicate balance. Too much strength could mean once again seeing good news framed as the precursor to an inflation rebound. As our Chart of Day shows, there have been plenty of moments over the last year alone where markets have been rooting for data to cool off. At times, data that's come in weaker than expectations has been cheered by investors fearful of another spike in inflation and interest rates staying higher for longer than initially hoped.\nMarkets appear to be wrestling with what the narrative shift means. After initially rallying nearly 1% on Friday after the jobs report, the S&P 500 was off nearly 1% on Monday. This comes as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added about 20 basis points over the past two sessions to breach 4% for the first time since August. \nThis move in yields represents how market participants are now adjusting to expect fewer interest rate cuts from the Fed as the economy holds steady. A week ago, investors were pricing in a 34% chance that the Fed would cut interest rates by another half a percentage point in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool. As of Monday, investors were pricing no chance of a jumbo-size cut and instead giving a 15% chance to the Fed not moving rates at all.\nFor now, this seems to be acceptable for equity investors. Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon noted that further good economic news could be welcomed by investors \"as long as inflation remains in check.\" At some point, though, the move higher on yields could weigh on investor appetite for risk in the stock market.\n\"If the data continue to improve, long-term rates and commodity prices are likely headed higher, which could put a strain on stocks without [earnings per share],\" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients.\nSosnick said the current economic backdrop leads to a \"tough setup\" for anyone hoping for more interest rate cuts over the next 12 months (yes, we're looking at you, potential homebuyers).\nBut on balance, this is an instance to see the forest through the trees. Fewer interest rate cuts because the economy is doing better than everyone thought isn't a bad thing. If asked to pick between more interest rate cuts or a better economy, Sosnick said he's \"always going to pick the stronger economy.\"\nHe added, \"We should always be looking for a stronger economy because that's really what drives stock prices.\"\nSo, while many things about the economic narrative may be coming back, that framing of rooting for good data to drive corporate profits has never left.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Is the economy booming or busting?\nDepends on whom you ask.\nThe official data is buoyant — economic growth is solid, the job market is strong, and stocks keep hitting record highs.\nYet many Americans think the economy stinks.\nThe latest gloomy indicator is a Guardian-Harris survey in which 55% of respondents said they think the economy is shrinking and 56% think we’re in the midst of a recession.\nEconomic output, adjusted for inflation, grew by a solid 3% during the most recent 12-month period. The unemployment rate is 3.9%. And the US economy created over 3.5 million jobs in 2023.\nYou basically can’t have a recession when the economy is growing and employers keep hiring at this rate. But this Harris poll isn’t a one-off.\nA leading measure of small business sentiment is near recessionary levels. So are some consumer confidence surveys. President Biden’s approval rating is in the tank, too, indicating many Americans associate the poor economy they think we have with the job Biden has done as president.\nThe Guardian-Harris survey also found that 49% of respondents think the S&P 500 index is down for the year. In reality, stocks have been ripping: The S&P 500 is up 13% this year on top of a 24% gain last year.\nSomething seems off with the Guardian-Harris finding that half of Americans think the stock market is in decline. In a different survey, Gallup found that 62% of Americans own stocks, mostly through retirement and investing accounts. If that's true, wouldn't most or all of those people know their portfolios are gaining value?\nThe Guardian-Harris poll didn't specify how many respondents own stocks, but these two surveys seem to conflict. People know how much money they have, and stock market investors are either underrepresented in the Harris poll or overrepresented in Gallup's.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nStatistical anomalies probably explain part of the reason why polls show people to be remarkably dour about an economy doing pretty well, but it would be a mistake to think this is just a measurement problem. Or worse, to think many people are just too dumb to know how good they have it.\nThis is perhaps Biden's top problem as he seeks a second term in office: convincing Americans that the economy is working for them without talking down or sounding dismissive.\nInflation is obviously one of the main economic gremlins of the last three years.\nYahoo Finance’s Janna Herron recently explained how consumers consider the optimal level of inflation to be basically zero, considerably lower than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.\nIf zero inflation is ideal for most people, inflation peaking at 9% in June 2022 served as a traumatic shock. Even the current rate of 3.4%, fairly close to the Fed’s target, is way too high if your hope is prices never go up.\nThere's plenty of other evidence showing Americans continue to feel stung by prices that have gone up and stayed up, even if the annual rate of change is now more benign.\nAnother challenge for Biden is that many Americans are probably comparing today's US economy to the economy in 2019. On that basis, yes, inflation is worse now, gas prices are higher, and there are unnerving wars in Europe and the Middle East.\nCompared to the rest of the world, however, US economy looks fantastic. No economy emerged from the COVID pandemic stronger. Inflation, caused mainly by COVID-related supply chain snafus, emerged mostly everywhere, and it has fallen more quickly in the United States than in most other places. Telling voters it could be worse, however, is rarely a winning message.\nIt’s also irrational to compare the Biden economy to that of his predecessor, Donald Trump, who’s back this year making another run for the White House.\nThere’s a good chance the economy would have looked more or less the same from 2017 to 2021 if Biden were president instead of Trump. Same for the last three years, if Trump were in office instead of Biden.\nThe factors that have changed the US economy in the last few years are more influential than anything Trump or Biden has done.\nTrump enjoyed a benign economic environment. And, importantly, American shale energy firms were competing for market share with Middle East oil drillers, which led to overproduction and low gas prices for consumers. On the other hand, Trump got slammed with the COVID outbreak in 2020 and the madness of lockdowns and business closures.\nBiden took office as COVID vaccines were rolling out, allowing a gradual return to normal. But COVID disruptions generated the inflation that’s been the bane of Biden’s presidency.\nRussia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring just as the OPEC+ nations were cutting output and American drillers were focusing on profitability over market share. All of that pushed energy prices higher, contributing to a big chunk of the soaring inflation in 2022 that still hangs over Biden's economic record.\nSomething else that may be bumming people out is the end of COVID stimulus.\nIn annual surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve, Americans reported their best financial health in 2021 — when the economy was still making up lost ground from the pandemic-related downturn. The economy got progressively stronger in 2022 and 2023, but Americans said their financial situation deteriorated in each of those years as prices rose.\nThe peak thrust of $6 trillion worth of COVID-related stimulus for consumers and businesses flowed through in 2021. As those programs ended, the “excess savings” that built up while people were stuck at home receiving stimulus checks dried up and were basically gone by the end of 2023.\nSo, if Americans are comparing the economy now to one from three years ago that featured the government raining down helicopter money, then yeah, it’s a little tougher.\nNow, do endless surveys asking people their opinions on the economy even matter? If Biden wins reelection in November, maybe not.\nBut if voters bounce Biden, it will be clear they’ve been signaling their displeasure for a good long while. Even if the data doesn't totally back it up.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Every four years, we elect a new president to lead our nation. Also referred to as “the leader of the free world,” this person is often judged and associated with how the economy is doing when they’re up for reelection, whether they’re an incumbent or a new candidate running for the first time.\nIn a recent Gallup News poll, the economy was the most important issue for voters in the 2024 presidential election. Republican voters rated the economy and immigration as the two most important issues. Meanwhile, the top issues for Democrats were democracy and potential Supreme Court justice picks.\nRead Next: How President-Elect Trump’s Win Could Change Gas Prices\nLearn More: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2025\nIn the 2024 presidential election, the electorate spoke loud and clear: President-elect Donald Trump won all seven critical swing states and the popular vote by a wide margin.\nTrump was favored over Vice President Kamala Harris by nine points to handle the economy, but does the president affect such a critical system as much as we think?\nTrending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nResearch from Georgia Tech’s School of Public Policy indicated presidential traits that may generally have a positive impact on the U.S. economy:\nAn ability to build and maintain trust in major political and economic institutions in the U.S.\nAn active view of government.\nAn active stance in the face of crisis.\nAn ability to negotiate and compromise.\nHaving a strong vision for where they want to take the county.\nWhile these traits can make a difference, it remains to be seen if Trump will live up to his grand economic promises as he enters his second term.\nHowever, experts explain that in reality, the sitting president doesn’t have as much impact on the economy as people may assume.\nCheck Out: How President-Elect Trump’s Win Could Impact Grocery Prices\nThe state of the economy can (and usually does) guide how people vote when choosing the next president. A September 2024 survey from financial services company Empower showed that one in two Americans believe that the outcome of the presidential 2024 presidential election directly impacts their finances.\n“Voters absolutely are using the economy as a metric by which to evaluate presidents,” explained John Kane, a clinical associate professor of politics at New York University, to CNBC.\n“People can eventually get this sort of picture in their minds of a president as kind of an economic wizard behind a curtain that’s pulling levers, and we’re just all on the receiving end.”\nHowever, the president alone isn’t responsible for economic outcomes. Generally, policymakers have two main tools to influence the economy: monetary and fiscal policy. This domain largely falls under the Federal Reserve Bank whose decisions have serious implications on interest rates, unemployment and inflation across the nation.\nWhile the sitting president may choose the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, usually someone who has the same monetary and fiscal ideology as they do, the president does not have control over the decisions made by the central bank.\nFurthermore, to enact sweeping fiscal policy, the president can’t do much without the support of Congress.\n“There has been a tendency on the part of our society led by politicians to exaggerate the amount of power that the president wields,” said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate, to CNBC. “And that’s encouraged by participants in these campaigns: ‘You’ve got a problem? I’m going to solve it.'”\nThe bottom line is it’s important to fully realize the president’s role in the economy and take a holistic approach when choosing a presidential candidate.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "date": "2024-10-01T16:31:45.000Z",
        "article_content": "The American economy is seemingly fairing so well that UBS has signaled a potential return to the glory days.\nThe European finance giant believes Uncle Sam is inching closer to a \"Roaring ’20s\" scenario, placing the likelihood of an incoming booming economic cycle at 50%.\nThe phrase harkens back to the same decade a century ago, when massive economic growth prompted a construction boom and rising prosperity for families.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, the 1920s had the hallmarks of a strong economic cycle: a wider adoption of electricity and automobiles, as well as a postwar boom in consumption.\nAt the time, the average person may not have realized their luck—and this is the phenomenon the U.S. finds itself in at present, writes Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS.\nWhile economists are concerned about a potential rise in unemployment, a recession, or stagflation, Draho argues the balance is only tipping higher toward a period of prosperity for Americans.\nIn a note released yesterday, Draho wrote that by the bank's criteria the U.S. economy is already in another Roaring ’20s.\nHe said: \"It’s no longer too soon nor too optimistic to suggest that the US will experience a Roaring ‘20s economy. It already is by our criteria, with the relevant question being whether these conditions will continue, not whether they will materialize.\n\"The odds continue to rise for this bull-case scenario, with many recent developments on the demand side, supply side, and monetary policy all supportive.\"\nInvestors are increasingly coming around to a soft-landing consensus, he added.\nA September survey of 37 economists from the Financial Times found the majority did not expect to see a contraction in the next couple of years.\nThe survey—and its optimistic outlook—took place ahead of the Fed's anticipated rate cut last month, which markets have since seen as a rebalancing toward the unemployment side of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) mandate, thus ensuring a level of productivity and activity.\n\"The way things have been trending, it’s quite possible that by early 2025 only the most pessimistic investors will need rose-colored glasses to see a clear path to a Roaring ‘20s outcome,\" Draho added.\nDraho outlined UBS's criteria to officially declare the 2020s a \"Roaring ’20s\": sustained GDP growth of 2.5% or higher, inflation in the 2-3% range, a Fed funds rate around 3.5%, and the 10-year Treasury yield around 4%.\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP for Q2 2024 increased at an annual rate of 3%—ticking the first box.\nFollowing Jerome Powell's intense wrangle with inflation, the 12-month CPI percentage for August 2024 came in at 2.5%—ticking the second box.\nThe fed funds rate—despite a higher-than-expected cut last month—sits above UBS's threshold at 4.75% to 5%.\nAnd in a bid to foster employment—and as a result productivity and consumer spending—Draho believes the Fed might have to compromise on its target inflation rate of 2%.\nIt's a notion the likes of JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has already floated, with Draho adding: \"The relevance for the Roaring ’20s outcome is that the Fed signaled a strong desire to preserve the soft landing and maintain full employment, even if it means inflation descends more gradually back to 2%.\"\nThe FOMC would never publicly admit it would accept inflation above 2%, Draho added but countered: \"A 50bps rate cut is not an explicit signal that the Fed is targeting this outcome, but the bread crumbs suggest a policy reaction function that is directionally supportive of a Roaring ’20s outcome.\"\nRising unemployment has been the factor which has caused even the more hawkish members of the FOMC to pause. \nThe Sahm Rule—which in the past has been accurate in predicting when an economy will enter a recession—was triggered back in July.\nThe Sahm Rule looks at two factors: the current three-month moving average of U.S. unemployment and the lowest three-month moving average of U.S. unemployment over the past year.\nIf the current average is higher than the lowest average by more than half a percentage point, the American economy is headed for a recession. Its latest reading for August sits at 0.57 pp.\nDraho admits that the labor market could prove to be the snag in America's return to an economic heyday, writing: \"Cooling over the past six months has done more than just rebalance the labor market, it has left it looser than it was pre-pandemic.\"\n\"The U.S. election and the escalating war in the Middle East are also sources of potential risks,\" adds Draho.\nOf course, the original Roaring ’20s had their end as well. The Great Depression kicked off with the Black Tuesday Wall Street stock market crash in October 1929.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nOver the past few years, a stronger-than-expected US economy has continuously surprised Wall Street and its projections.\nWhile we've become somewhat used to them now, the recent underestimations are a reversal of what was seen prior to the pandemic when US economic forecasts were often too lofty, RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Yahoo Finance.\nAnd now, heading into 2025, strategists like Calvasina are leaning into the post-pandemic trend and betting consensus economic forecasts will once again be surprised to the upside by the US economy.\n\"Given that history recently of underestimating [US economic growth] and the fact that GDP forecasts for next year are creeping up very, very, very slowly, I'm making a bet on the 2% to 3% [growth] instead of the 1% to 2%,\" said Calvasina, who sees the S&P 500 ending next year at 6,600.\nOn Tuesday, Wells Fargo's Christopher Harvey issued the most bullish target on Wall Street at 7,007 while highlighting a \"cyclical opportunity catalyzed by upward GDP revisions.\"\nIf 2024's market driving abbreviation was AI, 2025's is set to be GDP.\nBank of America's equity and quantitative strategy team offered a similar pitch in its 2025 outlook note, which forecast the S&P 500 ending the year at 6,666. The firm's economics team projects the US economy will grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than Bloomberg consensus forecasts for 2.1% growth.\nThis has BofA favoring \"GDP sensitive companies,\" with the firm recommending overweights on the Financials (XLF), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), Materials (XLB), Real Estate (XLRE), and Utilities (XLU) sectors.\n\"We see more opportunities in stocks than the index,\" Bofa's Savita Subramanian wrote. \"In particular, we like companies with healthy cash return prospects and a tether to the US economy: large cap Value stocks.\"\nCalvasina agrees.\n\"For Value to outperform, in recent years we’ve needed to see GDP run a bit hotter,\" Calvasina said. \"We’ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it’s a close call.\"\nDeutsche Bank's Bankhim Chadha, who is among Wall Street's most bullish strategists, projecting the S&P 500 to end 2025 at 7,000, also believes a \"historically strong economic backdrop\" will be a key driver.\n\"While the consensus looked for recession [in recent years] the economic backdrop turned out to be very robust, with the present combination of low unemployment and strong GDP growth seen only 6% of the time historically,\" Chadha wrote. \"Prior such episodes, during the 1960s and [the second half of the] 1990s also saw strong equity performance.\"\nA close look at Calvasina's work shows why economic growth meeting, or exceeding, positive expectations could be crucial to the stock market rally. Dating back to 1947, GDP has grown between 1.1% and 2% five times. Stocks were higher just 40% in those years with an average decline of 3.4%. Meanwhile, in years when GDP tracked between 2.1% and 3%, stocks were higher 70% of the time with an average return of nearly 11%.\nSo while some Wall Street strategists are often quick to tell you the stock market is not the economy, it seems like, at least for 2025, history is showing us that when the economy starts to decline toward 0%, it's not usually a positive sign for stocks. Perhaps a reason why the economy falling short of the more than 2.1% growth expectations and potentially flashing signs of a slowdown isn't a part of the bullish calls headed into next year.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-05-05T22:21:48.000Z",
        "article_content": "Last year's consensus was that the U.S. economy was headed for a recession, but that didn't happen. This year's consensus is that we'll have a soft landing, in which the economy slows but won't tip into a recession. That could be wrong too.\nDoubling down on his contrarian view, Citi chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst told Bloomberg TV on Thursday that he sees a hard landing. In fact, inflation and the labor market will weaken enough that the Federal Reserve will cut benchmark rates four times this year—far more than the one or two cuts Wall Street expects.\nHis warning proved prescient as the Labor Department's payroll report the following day showed that the economy added 175,000 jobs in April, down sharply from the blockbuster increase of 315,000 in March and well below the 233,000 gain that economists had predicted.\nOn Thursday, Hollenhorst said other data have been signaling weakness in the labor market, including surveys of consumers and businesses that say jobs are getting harder to find, companies are less eager to hire, and employees are feeling more worried about keeping their jobs.\nTo be sure, data in recent weeks have offered mixed signals on the economy. The latest employment cost index rose more than expected, suggesting a strong job market. Meanwhile, the first-quarter GDP report showed growth cooled more sharply than anticipated. But that was due largely to a wider trade deficit and slower inventory restocking, while consumer demand remained robust.\nBut Hollenhorst is convinced there won't be a soft landing, and he said financial markets are starting to move away from that hope as well.\n\"The reason I think the Fed's going to see enough to cut is because we're more toward the hard landing end of the spectrum,\" he told Bloomberg TV.\nMeanwhile, the Fed won't wait for both inflation and the labor market to weaken before cutting rates, he noted. It needs to see only one or the other.\nWhen asked if his view for four rate cuts this year also means that they wouldn't provide enough economic stimulus to stave off a hard landing, Hollenhorst said almost every monetary policy cycle has played out that way.\n\"We're in the higher-for-longer stage of the policy cycle,\" he explained, noting that stubborn inflation has prevented rates from coming down. \"The next stage of the policy cycle is a weakening of the labor market. Once it starts gradually weakening, it then weakens more sharply. I think that's exactly what's playing out now.\"\nIn February, even amid blowout jobs reports, Hollenhorst was warning about a hard landing and told CNBC that he expected a recession by the middle of this year.\nLooking past the upbeat headline jobs numbers, he said there were signs of softness, such as the number of hours worked and the number of full-time jobs dropping.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "The US economy grew at a slightly less rapid pace than economists had expected in the third quarter.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis's advance estimate of third quarter US gross domestic product (GDP) showed the economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.8% during the period, below the 2.9% growth expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The reading came in lower than the 3% growth in the second quarter. \nWhile slightly below expectations, several economists noted the third quarter GDP print reflected strong economic growth. Capital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth noted the report shows an economy growing at a solid pace.\n\"Overall, the US economy appears to be doing just fine,\" Ashworth wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, the \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, grew by 2.2% in the second quarter, above estimates of 2.1% but significantly lower than the 2.8% gain in the prior quarter.\nThe data's release comes as investors try to gauge how much more the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2024.

        "article_content": "The US economy appears on track for another solid quarter of growth, new data showed Monday, while also pointing to potential \"headwinds\" in the manufacturing sector and with price pressures.\nS&P Global's flash US composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, came in at 54.4 in September, down from 54.6 in August. Economists had expected the index to tick down to 54.3.\nChris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the data shows the US economy is pacing for \"healthy\" growth in the third quarter, which will come to a close at the end of September.\n“The sustained robust expansion of output signaled by the PMI in September is consistent with a healthy annualized rate of GDP growth of 2.2% in the third quarter,\" Williamson said in the release.\nAfter a better-than-expected update on retail sales in August, economists have been expecting a solid third quarter of growth for the US economy. As of Sept. 18, the Goldman Sachs economics team had been tracking third quarter GDP at 3%, while the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool saw 2.9% annualized growth.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week also cited the still-healthy economy as a reason to cut interest rates and not get behind the curve.\n\"The US economy is in good shape,\" Powell said. \"It's growing at a solid pace. Inflation is coming down. The labor market is in a strong pace. We want to keep it there.\"\nThere were some signs of slowing within Monday's S&P Global data, however.\nThe services component of S&P's report showed the index registered 55.4 this month, down from 55.7 in August. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity continued to lag, falling to a 15-month low of 47 from 47.9 the month prior.\nAny reading above 50 for these indexes represents expansion in the sector; readings below 50 indicate contraction. Additionally, prices charged rose at the fastest rate in six months, which Williamson noted could be cause for concern on the inflation front.\n“The early survey indicators for September point to an economy that continues to grow at a solid pace, albeit with a weakened manufacturing sector and intensifying political uncertainty acting as substantial headwinds,\" Williamson said. \"A reacceleration of inflation is meanwhile also signaled, suggesting the Fed cannot totally shift its focus away from its inflation target as it seeks to sustain the economic upturn.\"\nRead more: Cell phones, furniture, used cars: Here's where prices are easing up as inflation cooldown continues\nThe survey's future output index, which measures optimism about economic output in the year ahead, hit its lowest level since October 2022 too.\n“Business sentiment, demand, hiring and investment are being subdued by uncertainty surrounding the Presidential Election, casting a shadow over the outlook for the year ahead at many firms,\" Williamson wrote.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-04-19T17:01:40.000Z",
        "article_content": "You’ve likely seen your grocery bill go up significantly in the last few years as inflation continues to impact the prices of everyday goods. While the Fed has raised rates in an attempt to cool down the economy, you’re still likely feeling the impact of inflation every time you go shopping for food since grocery prices have increased 25% in the last four years, as reported by The Washington Post. To make matters worse, you may see confusing headlines about inflation slowing down even though you’re still spending more than ever on eating and other basics.\nWe will examine what grocery prices tell you about the economy.\nRead More: Net Worth for US Families: How To Tell if You’re Poor, Middle-Class, Upper Middle-Class or RichTrending Now: How To Get $340 Per Year in Cash Back on Gas and Other Things You Already Buy\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\n“When we look at day-to-day expenses like grocery prices, they can give us a glimpse into the state of the economy,” said Dre Villeroy, CEO of Beyorch, an asset management and investment fiduciary firm. “Grocery prices often move up or down based on changes in supply and demand, as well as broader economic trends.”\n“When it comes to grocery prices, specifically looking at typical household necessities like eggs and breads, the price significantly reflects the rate of inflation,” said Aaron Cirksena, founder and CEO of MDRN Capital.\n“Prices for bread are 138.83% higher in 2024 than in 1997 which is a $6.94 difference,” Cirksena said. “When we see everyday expenses like food and gas increasing, we know it’s an indication of inflation.”\nThose we spoke with agree that grocery prices indicate the overall economy since broader macro issues impact them. Experts believe that grocery prices have stayed high due to a combination of pandemic-related labor shortages, ongoing supply chain issues, natural problems with crops and shifts in consumer demand. As consumers anxiously wait for grocery prices to return to pre-pandemic levels, many experts don’t see this happening and policymakers don’t appear to have a resolution.\nDiscover Next: Toilet Paper to Discontinued Items: 7 Ways Shrinkflation Has Come to Costco\n“Beyond groceries, other common expenses like fuel, utilities and rent can also provide clues about economic trends,” Villeroy said. “For instance, higher fuel costs can affect transportation expenses and the prices of goods and services across the board. Similarly, increases in utilities and rent can put a strain on household budgets, potentially slowing down consumer spending and leading to tighter margins for businesses.”\nThese everyday expenses impact the overall economy since they’re more connected than we may realize. As fuel costs rise, consumers may take fewer road trips or they may limit overall spending as they try to work within their new budgetary constraints.\nEvery expense matters because when consumers have less disposable income, they have less money to spend on certain luxury items. When consumers adjust their spending, this means that companies make less money and report lower earnings.\n“These shifts in everyday costs can impact consumer confidence and market stability, influencing everything from investment strategies to employment rates,” Villeroy said.\nWhen companies report lower revenue, they may have to lay off employees, which impacts consumer spending. This creates a challenging economic cycle that’s difficult to break out of.\nWhat can you do? Villeroy suggested the following:\n“By keeping track of these trends, you can make more informed choices about your financial planning and investment strategies, preparing yourself for potential changes in our economic environment. Being prepared can help you navigate uncertain times and keep your finances on track.”\nWhat do grocery prices say about the economy compared to what the government announces? The most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that inflation was at 3.5% for March, with food up 2.2% annually, a 0.1% increase from February. The report also stated that three of the six major grocery store group indexes decreased over the month.\nWhile this may feel like positive news, the reality is that grocery prices have gone up so much over the last few years that people are still feeling the pinch. Many consumers may still be recovering from the previous price increases that forced them to dip into savings or rely on credit.\n“The reported inflation data is an aggregate of many goods and services, which makes the inflation rate feel a bit lower than it actually is,” Cirksena said.\nSince the CPI data is based on a basket of goods and services, we may not get the entire picture of inflation figures since some items could bring the overall number down.\n“Since 2021, grocery prices have risen by more than other inflationary measures,” Cirksena said.\nEven though overall inflation has cooled, it doesn’t mean that food prices have decreased or stopped increasing. Everyone feels the pain differently as well have unique shopping and eating patterns.\nAccording to CPI inflation data, grocery prices jumped 12% in 2022, the largest leap since 1978. American families are spending, on average, 25% more on their groceries than they were before the pandemic started in 2020.\n“Additionally, consumers are now dealing with shrinkflation,” Cirksena said. “That pound of bacon that was $3.99 4 years ago is now $4.99, and now it’s only 12 oz.”\nThe final point about grocery prices is the role of shrinkflation, as people may be getting less than they used to. This could lead to increased consumption or a shift in eating habits.\n“If prices are rising, it might suggest that production costs are up, or there are issues with the supply chain, both of which can point to inflationary pressures,” Cirksena said. “When basic goods become more expensive, it can affect how much disposable income people have left to spend on other items.”\nGrocery prices tell us more about the economy than we may realize. Understanding this is important when creating or adjusting a budget so that we can plan accordingly.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Single Best Thing To Buy at Costco in April 2024\n10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\nThis is One of the Best Ways to Boost Your Retirement Savings in 2024\n7 Things You'll Be Happy You Downgraded in Retirement\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: What Grocery Prices Tell You About the Economy, According to Experts"

That was just slightly higher than the threshold of 80 that usually signals a recession ahead.\nStocks hit session lows after the Conference's Board's release and then pared losses.\n\"Consumer views of current labor market conditions continued to improve, consistent with recent jobs and unemployment data, but their assessment of business conditions weakened,\" Conference Board chief economist Dana Peterson said in a press release. \"Compared to last month, consumers in December were substantially less optimistic about future business conditions and incomes. Moreover, pessimism about future employment prospects returned after cautious optimism prevailed in October and November.\"\nIn December, 21.3% of respondents expected fewer jobs to be available in the next six months, up from 17.9% the month prior. Meanwhile, expectations for income decreases and worse business conditions in the next six months also moved higher.\nThe potential impact of President-elect Donald Trump's policies remained top of mind for consumers in December, per the Conference Board. Mentions of \"politics\" and \"tariffs\" both increased in December.\nAccording to the data, \"46% of US consumers expected tariffs to raise the cost of living while 21% expected tariffs to create more US jobs.\"\nAlso in Monday's release: The percent of consumers expecting higher stock prices in the next year fell to 52.9% from a record high of 57.2% seen in November.\nThe survey period ended on Dec. 16, meaning consumers submitted their responses prior to last Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting. But the tone of the December survey from the Conference Board fell in line with uncertainty highlighted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell that rattled markets last week.\nMarkets sold off the day the meeting concluded when Powell explained why the central bank is expecting to cut interest rates at a slower pace than it had previously expected. Powell used some version of the word \"uncertain\" the greatest number of times seen in a Fed press conference in 2024. He said there was higher uncertainty about inflation. He didn't outright decline the possibility of an interest rate hike next year.

Economists had estimated the reading to show annualized growth of 2.9%. The third estimate for second quarter GDP confirms that economic growth was higher than the 1.4% annualized growth seen in the first quarter.\n\"The revisions only strengthen our conviction that the US economy will continue to expand at a decent pace over the coming year, which suggests labor market conditions are unlikely to deteriorate markedly from here,\" Oxford Economics deputy chief economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\nSeparately, data from the US Labor Department released Thursday showed 218,000 unemployment claims were filed in the week ending Sept. 21, below Wall Street's expectations for 223,000. This marked the lowest level of weekly claims since the middle of May.\nThe data releases come a week after the Federal Reserve cut interest by half a percentage point in an effort to preserve what Fed Chair Powell described as an economy in \"good shape.\"\n\"[The economy is] growing at a solid pace.

        "article_content": "The US economy in 2024 has presented Wall Street with a singular challenge — keeping up.\nThe latest monthly jobs report showed continued signs of strength in a labor market expected to cool quickly in 2024. This data, along with signs of resilience in the consumer, has economists feeling increasingly better about the outlook for economic growth.\n\"The economy's momentum early this year has been stronger than we were expecting a few weeks (and months) ago,\" JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"While we still expect growth to slow, we think the economy might perform better in the middle part of the year than we had previously forecasted.\"\nFeroli's call for increased economic growth in the middle quarters of this year matches the broad shifts seen in consensus forecasts.\nIn January, Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha highlighted in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook that consensus had consistently underestimated economic growth over the past year. That's continued to play out, with quarter-over-quarter projections for economic growth in the first six months of this year increasing significantly since January.\nWall Street economists now expect the US economy to grow at an annualized rate of 1.8% in the first quarter, up from projections for 0.6% offered in January, according to Bloomberg data. Second quarter growth forecasts have also been revised up to 1.3% from 0.4% over that period.\nFeroli boosted his firm's forecast for Q2 GDP to 1.5% from 0.5% previously after Friday's jobs report.\nDeutsche Bank senior US economist Brett Ryan, whose team removed their call for a recession in 2024 last month, said the shifting narrative in the US economy has largely been driven by a stronger-than-expected labor market preventing a downturn in consumer spending.\n\"The labor market is not usually a leading indicator, but it is a sustaining indicator,\" Ryan told Yahoo Finance. \"And what you earn is what gets spent.\"\nAverage hourly earnings grew 4.3% annually in February, per data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This was a move down from January's 4.5% annual wage growth, but, notably, that number remains above headline price increases seen in various inflation indicators and helps support consumer spending from a downturn, per Ryan. Headline inflation rose 3.2% in February.\nWage growth also comes as data shows few signs of widespread layoffs in the labor market, despite headlines of layoffs to start the year. That is counter to what Ryan's team at Deutsche Bank had feared entering this year and also contributes to a more bullish outlook for the US economy.\n\"Firms are holding on to their workers,\" Ryan said. \"The way to interpret that is that it's a tight labor market still, and firms are reluctant to part with their current workers ...That's what's kind of holding things up right now.\"\nLike the latest labor market data, inflation prints have also challenged the market consensus.\nTuesday's read on inflation showed prices not falling as quickly as many had expected to start this year. This reiterated a more tempered outlook on inflation that first arose in January.\nIn turn, expectations for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have moved to June from March.\n\"The hotter than forecast February core CPI reading will further add to Fed [officials'] cautiousness regarding the inflation outlook,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote in a note to clients after the release. \"While we thought a May rate cut was on the table, it is increasingly likely that the FOMC waits at least until June to start easing monetary policy.\"\nBut as Tuesday's roughly 1% rally in the S&P 500 showed, these shifts in the economic consensus and outlook for the Fed have done little to stifle a rally in US stocks.\nOr as Oppenheimer chief market strategist John Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday, the new economic consensus is proving \"navigable\" for markets.\n\"We think that essentially what really counts is this resilience that we're seeing in consumer and business,\" Stoltzfus said.\nRBC capital markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina also noted that the shift in economic forecasts has come alongside a rotation in stock market performance, where areas outside the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks have begun to outperform.\n\"We have been arguing over the past few months that for the rotation in stock market leadership seen in November and December to resume, US GDP forecasts would need to keep improving and get closer to above-average levels,\" Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Sunday night.\n\"While we aren’t there yet, we’ve gotten a lot closer.\"\nAs Calvasina highlighted, that shift isn't fully underway just yet, as seen on Tuesday when the interest rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT) ended its streak of outperforming the S&P 500.\nZooming out beyond one day's trade, Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider has told Yahoo Finance the case is building for further stock gains outside of just tech stocks.\n\"From a macro perspective, the most important driver of US stocks is earnings,\" Snider said on March 4. \"And earnings are growing. They're growing for the largest companies. They're also growing for smaller companies.\"\nHe added: \"The strength we're seeing in the economy and in corporate America is much broader based than just the AI trade that has captured so much attention recently.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The index is now up 0.3% year to date, up 33.7% from its October 12, 2022 closing low of 3,577.03 and down 0.3% from its January 3, 2022 record closing high of 4,796.56.\nOften times, those discussing what’s driving the stock market will appear in conflict with those discussing what’s driving the economy. And sometimes, those discussing what’s driving the economy will appear in conflict with each other.\nThese diverging views will happen even though everyone is in total agreement about the validity of the measurable data they’re citing.\nHow is this possible?\nI think we can begin to disentangle what’s going on by thinking of people as wearing one of many different hats. There are at least four important hats that are worth a closer look.\nHard data is anything that reflects quantifiable and observable behavior — stuff that is actually happening. Think job creation, wage growth, industrial output, retail sales, government spending, imports and exports, and consumer prices. There are receipts for all these things.\nThese include metrics that help us determine whether or not the economy is in expansion or recession.\nWe may actually need to divide this hat into two hats depending on how you measure economic activity. Some say the direction of the economy is reflected in two quarters’ worth of GDP, which relies strictly on monetary values of activity. Others go by the official NBER definition of activity, which considers non-monetary metrics like changes in employment.\nWhile the GDP-oriented economy observers have perspectives that differ from the NBER-oriented observers, they at least agree that the activity is based on hard measures. It’s just a matter of how they weight those measures.\nGenerally speaking, hard data metrics have been favorable — mostly reflecting a growing economy.\nFor more, read: The economy has gone from very hot to pretty good 😎 and You call this a recession? 🤨\nSoft data is generated through surveys of consumers and business operators expressing their opinions, feelings and expectations about things like job security, financial health, inflation, future business activity, and labor quality. They’re measurements of stuff people feel is happening or feel will happen.\nPopular reports capturing soft data include the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, the ISM’s Manufacturing PMI, the NFIB’s Small Business Optimism Index, and the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers.\nSoft data reflect the vibes, as Kyla Scanlon would say.\nRecently — despite robust hard economic data — the economic vibes haven’t been great, as consumer and business sentiment have spent most of the past two years in the dumps.\nDoes this mean we should dismiss the sentiment data?\nOf course not.\nWhat good is it to have lots of money and to buy everything you want if you’re more unhappy than you were when you had less money and less stuff?\nFor more, read: A bullish contradiction 🛍 and What businesses do > what businesses say 🙊\nIn the short run, news about the hard and soft economic data can move the stock market. Technical factors in the markets will also move prices in the near term. Pretty much anything you imagine can affect trader decisions and investor sentiment, which in turn affects the markets over short periods of time.\nBut in the long run, the most important driver of stock prices is earnings.\nAs I explained in TKer Stock Market Truth No. 2, \"News about the economy or policy moves markets to the degree they are expected to impact earnings. Earnings (a.k.a. profits) are why you invest in companies.\"\nWhen thinking about stocks over the long term, soft economic metrics matter to the degree they affect hard economic metrics. And hard economic metrics matter to the degree they affect earnings.\nThis can get complicated, because it’s certainly possible to have economic recessions that aren’t associated with earnings recessions.\nAs explained in the Nov. 29 TKer, 2024 could be a year when the stock market performs considerably better than the economy due to contrasting exposures to the goods and services sectors. Improving economic metrics won’t always coincide with improving earnings, and vice versa.\nEarnings, for their part, have been trending higher and are expected to keep going higher, which helps explain why stock prices are near record highs. Analysts expect double-digit earnings growth in 2024 and 2025.\nAnd when earnings are going up, the stock market usually goes up.\nFor more, read: Earnings are the most important driver of stock prices💰\nUnfortunately, there are many people and entities who are unable to look at data objectively. And so whatever the development may be, they’ll figure out a way to spin it so the story confirms their priors.\nThis is often the case for permabears, who’ll spin anything negatively, and permabulls, who’ll spin anything positively.\nThere are also some business news reporters and outlets who are more concerned about getting clicks and engagement on their stories than they are about reporting the data fairly. And so while the balance of data may be favorable, you may get outsized coverage of unfavorable cherry-picked data if it attracts reader interest.\nPolitical persuasions can play a huge role in how people view data. If you’re in office and you’re looking to get re-elected, then you’ll probably spin developments in your favor. If you’re not in office but seeking to get elected, then you’ll have an incentive to spin the data unfavorably so the incumbent looks bad.\nAs the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment data shows, views on the economy contrast considerably depending on political affiliations.\nTo be fair, biased views and balanced views aren’t totally mutually exclusive. In many cases, their conclusions may be in line.\nBut in other cases, biased folks will turn a blind eye to developments that undermine their priors, and that can be dangerous for anyone listening.\nBeware the motivations of those communicating information.\nFore more, read: 11 ways cynics argue any news is bad news 👎, A 5-step guide to processing ambiguous news 📋, Is good economic news really all that surprising? 📰, and Beware alarming business stories that get a lot of news coverage 🗞️\nSo, how’s the economy?\nWell, it depends on whom you ask.\nThe hard data folks will likely tell you the economy is growing, but it appears to be cooling. Many warn a recession could be around the corner.\nThe soft data folks will probably tell you the economic vibes aren’t good, but there are signs they’re improving.\nThe stock market folks might tell you economic growth may be cooling — but in a way that should allow big companies to report healthy earnings growth, which should help send stock prices higher.\nHowever Democrats feel, you can bet Republicans feel worse.\nEach group may have different tones, but they’re not necessarily in disagreement about the measurable data.\nFULL DISCLOSURE: TKer tends to wear the stock market hat.\n-\nRelated from TKer:\nWhat businesses do > what businesses say 🙊\nA bullish contradiction 🛍\nPeople have money 💵\nLet's take a peek at expectations for 2025 😳\nEarnings are the most important driver of stock prices💰\n9 big stories to watch in 2024 🔭\nWhy permabears seem right even when they're wrong 🐻\n10 truths about the stock market 📈\nThere were a few notable data points and macroeconomic developments from last week to consider:\n👍 Inflation is cool-ish. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in December was up 3.4% from a year ago. This was up from the 3.1% rate in November. Adjusted for food and energy prices, core CPI was up 3.9%, the lowest since May 2021.\nOn a month-over-month basis, CPI was up just 0.3%. Core CPI was up a modest 0.3%.\nIf you annualize the three-month trend in the monthly figures — a reflection of the short-term trend in prices — CPI was rising at a 1.8% rate and core CPI was climbing at a 3.3% rate.\nWhile many broad measures of inflation continue to hover above the Fed’s target rate of 2%, they are way down from peak levels in the summer of 2022. And the trend suggests they could continue to move lower.\nFor more, read: Inflation: Is the worst behind us? 🎈\n👍 Inflation expectations improve. From the New York Fed’s December Survey of Consumer Expectations: \"Median inflation expectations declined at all horizons, falling to 3.0% from 3.4% at the one-year ahead horizon, to 2.6% from 3.0% at the three-year ahead horizon, and to 2.5% from 2.7% at the five-year ahead horizon. Median inflation expectations at the one-year ahead horizon reached the lowest level recorded since January 2021.\"\nFor more, read: The end of the inflation crisis 🎈\n⛽️ Gas prices continue to fall. From AAA: \"The national average for a gallon of gas barely budged since last week, falling two cents to $3.07. The primary reason appears to be rather humdrum numbers for the cost of oil and gasoline demand. … According to new data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), gas demand increased from 7.95 to 8.33 million b/d last week. Meanwhile, total domestic gasoline stocks increased significantly by 8 million bbl to 245 million bbl. The slight uptick in demand has limited pump price drops, causing the national average to stagnate. However, if oil prices continue to drop, drivers could continue to see pump prices trickle lower.\"\nFor more on energy prices, read: The other side of the surging oil price story 🛢\n🏠 Mortgage rates tick up. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.66% from 6.62% the week prior. From Freddie Mac: \"Mortgage rates have not moved materially over the last three weeks and remain in the mid-six percent range, which has marginally increased homebuyer demand. Even this slight uptick in demand, combined with inventory that remains tight, continues to cause prices to rise faster than incomes, meaning affordability remains a major headwind for buyers. Potential homebuyers should look closely at existing state and local resources, such as down payment assistance programs, which can considerably help defray closing costs.\"\nFor more on home prices, read: Why home prices and rents are creating all sorts of confusion about inflation 😖\n📈 Small business optimism improves. The NFIB’s Small Business Optimism Index ticked higher in December.\nImportantly, the more tangible \"hard\" components of the index continue to hold up much better than the more sentiment-oriented \"soft\" components.\nKeep in mind that during times of stress, soft data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data.\nFor more on this, read: What businesses do > what businesses say 🙊 and Sentiment: Finally a vibe-spansion? 🙃\n📰 News coverage of the economy has been negative. Here’s FT’s Robin Wigglesworth on a recent study of the news: \"After scouring 1bn newspaper articles over 170 years (ca 95 times larger than the total number of English-language Wikipedia entries combined) some researchers have found a remarkable 50 year collapse in economic sentiment.\"\nFor whatever reason, news coverage of the economy has slanted negatively even during periods of economic prosperity.\nFor more, read: Is good economic news really all that surprising? 📰 , A 5-step guide to processing ambiguous news 📋, and Beware alarming business stories that get a lot of news coverage 🗞️\n💼 Unemployment claims fall. Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to 202,000 during the week ending January 6, down from 203,000 the week prior.

According to Redbook (via Bob Elliott), chain store retail sales rose 5.9% during the week ending January 9.\n🍾 The entrepreneurial spirit is alive.

From the Census Bureau: \"December 2023 Business Applications were 457,316, down 1.3% (seasonally adjusted) from November. Of those, 149,973 were High-Propensity Business Applications.\"\n💰 Corporate finances look strong. From BofA (via Mike Zaccardi): \"Higher interest rates are intended to slow the economy, in part, by making it more expensive for companies to borrow capital for expansion and investment. But after one of the fast and most aggressive rate hiking cycles in history, the number of firms declaring bankruptcy was the 2nd lowest in modern history. Note that corporate interest expenses are just 7% of profits, the most favorable level since 1957.\"\nFor more on corporate financial strength, read: Why higher interest rates haven't crushed corporate profits 🤔\n📈 Near-term GDP growth estimates look good.

While it’s true that the Fed has taken a less hawkish tone in 2023 than in 2022, and that most economists agree that the final interest rate hike of the cycle has either already happened or is near, inflation still has to cool more and stay cool for a little while before the central bank is comfortable with price stability.\nSo we should expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight, which means we should be prepared for tight financial conditions (e.g., higher interest rates, tighter lending standards, and lower stock valuations) to linger. All this means monetary policy will be unfriendly to markets for the time being, and the risk the economy slips into a recession will be relatively elevated.\nAt the same time, we also know that stocks are discounting mechanisms — meaning that prices will have bottomed before the Fed signals a major dovish turn in monetary policy.\nAlso, it’s important to remember that while recession risks may be elevated, consumers are coming from a very strong financial position. Unemployed people are getting jobs, and those with jobs are getting raises.\nSimilarly, business finances are healthy as many corporations locked in low interest rates on their debt in recent years. Even as the threat of higher debt servicing costs looms, elevated profit margins give corporations room to absorb higher costs.\nAt this point, any downturn is unlikely to turn into economic calamity given that the financial health of consumers and businesses remains very strong.\nAnd as always, long-term investors should remember that recessions and bear markets are just part of the deal when you enter the stock market with the aim of generating long-term returns. While markets have had a pretty rough couple of years, the long-run outlook for stocks remains positive."

        "date": "2024-12-19T13:35:01.000Z",
        "article_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The American economy grew at a healthy 3.1% annual clip from July through September, propelled by vigorous consumer spending and an uptick in exports, the government said in an upgrade to its previous estimate.\nThird-quarter growth in U.S. gross domestic product — the economy's output of goods and services — accelerated from the April-July rate of 3% and continued to look sturdy despite high interest rates, the Commerce Department said Thursday. GDP growth has now topped 2% in eight of the last nine quarters.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, expanded at a 3.7% pace, fastest since the first quarter of 2023 and an uptick from Commerce’s previous third-quarter estimate of 3.5%.\nExports climbed 9.6%. Business investment grew a lackluster 0.8%, but investment in equipment expanded 10.8%. Spending and investment by the federal government jumped 8.9%, including a 13.9% surge in defense spending.\nAmerican voters were unimpressed by the steady growth under Democratic President Joe Biden. Exasperated by prices that remain 20% higher than they were when an inflationary surge began in early 2021, they chose last month to send Donald Trump back to the White House with Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\nTrump will inherit an economy that looks healthy overall. The unemployment rate remains low at 4.2% even though it is up from the 53-year low 3.4% reached in April 2023. Inflation hit a four-decade high 9.1% in mid-2002. Eleven interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 helped bring it down — to 2.7% last month. That is above the Fed's 2% target. But the central bank still felt comfortable enough with the progress against inflation to cut its benchmark rate Wednesday for the third time this year.\nThe president-elect has promised sweeping changes in economic policy, including cutting taxes, imposing big tariffs on foreign goods and deporting millions of immigrants who work in the United States illegally. Many economists fear those policies will fuel higher inflation.\n“This week’s data show the economy is set to end 2024 on a solid note, which is fortunate since we’ll have to contend with heightened policy uncertainty and possibly greater challenges in 2025,” Oren Klachkin, an economist at Nationwide, wrote in a commentary.\nWithin the GDP data, a category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a solid 3.4% annual rate from July through September, an upgrade from the previous estimate and up from 2.7% in the April-June quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.\nWednesday’s report also contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.2%, up modestly from the previous estimate but down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter.\nThursday's report was the Commerce Department's third and final look at third-quarter GDP. It will publish its initial estimate of October-December growth on Jan. 30."

        "article_content": "Two separate data releases highlighted signs of softening in the economy on Thursday as the Federal Reserve mulls over when to cut interest rates.\nWeekly jobless claims once again rose more than expected last week in the latest sign of a cooling labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 249,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending July 27, up from 235,000 the week prior and the highest level since August 2023.\nMeanwhile, the latest reading on activity in US manufacturing showed the sector sank further into contraction during July. The ISM's manufacturing PMI registered a reading of 46.8 in July, down from June's reading of 48.5 and the lowest reading since November 2023.\n“Demand remains subdued, as companies show an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current federal monetary policy and other conditions,\" Institute for Supply Management chair Timothy Fiore said in a press release.\nThe weaker-than-expected economic data sent the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down about 12 basis points to 3.98%. This marked the first time the 10-year yield has fallen below 4% since February. Meanwhile, all three of the major stock indexes turned lower.\n\"The ongoing deterioration in the economic data as evidenced by today’s rising initial jobless claims, low unit labor costs, and abrupt slowing in global manufacturing activity suggest that we are getting to a point where bad economic news is bad for markets,\" Renaissance Macro's head of economic research Neil Dutta wrote in a note on Thursday. \"Until the Fed begins cutting, they are going to look behind the curve. In my view, the upshot is that this is a small policy mistake that can be undone very quickly.\"\nThe data comes less than 24 hours after the Fed held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its latest policy meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted the central bank is still seeking further confidence in inflation's path lower but also acknowledged a September interest rate cut \"could be on the table.\"\nPowell noted the Fed is now more attentive to not only the risk of inflation not falling, but also the risk of unemployment continuing to tick higher. For now, Powell said the Fed still believes the labor market is in the process of a \"gradual normalization.\"\n\"If we start to see something that looks to be more than that, then we're well positioned to respond,\" Powell said.\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nThe concern among economists remains that there are already signs of slowing in the labor market that warrant a closer look from the Fed. In Thursday's ISM report, the employment index tumbled to a reading of 43.4 in July, down from 49.3 in June.\nCapital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote in a note on Thursday that the decline in the employment index will likely \"raise some eyebrows.\" He added, \"It suggests there is a risk that the labour market softens beyond the normalisation we have already seen.\"\nJefferies US economist Thomas Simons noted that the rate cuts could help the sagging manufacturing sector, but \"it is looking more and more like it's going to take more than a handful of 25-basis-point moves.\"\nInvestors appeared to agree with Simons, as markets are now pricing in a 20% chance of a 50-basis-point interest rate cut in September, nearly double the odds seen just a day prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool. \nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The Federal Reserve now sees inflation as staying stubbornly elevated as it has become cautious about further interest rate cuts planned for next year.\nOn Wednesday, Trump blew up a bipartisan budget deal. He then promoted a deal reached with Republicans on Thursday that Democratic lawmakers and President Joe Biden see as unacceptable. It failed to get the two-thirds threshold needed for House passage. This comes on top of a spate of tariff threats by Trump that the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday would raise prices and hurt growth without raising enough revenues to cover the rest of his planned tax cuts.\nAs Trump prepares for a second term in the White House, his actions to undo a deal and replace it in under 24 hours test the proposition that markets — a favored Trump barometer of success — will accept his mix of uncertainty and reality TV drama.\nBut from the vantage of Trump world, the economy was already a mess. That's because of inflation, which is currently 2.7%, and public dissatisfaction with Biden.\n“On day one, President Trump will get to work to launch the largest deregulatory agenda in history, cut taxes, and expedite permitting for drilling and fracking to lower energy costs and inflation for all Americans,” said Karoline Leavitt, the transition spokeswoman and incoming press secretary.\nTurbulence already starting\nThe past few days are a reminder that the economic growth in the Republican’s first term was often accompanied by turmoil. It remains to be seen if voters already exhausted by inflation are ready for another round of blame games and uncertainty that the past few days have foreshadowed.\nTrump vowed on social media Wednesday to “fight ’till the end” unless Democrats agreed to lift the debt ceiling as a condition for the short-term funding to keep the federal government open. He and his billionaire friend and adviser Elon Musk also promised to fund challengers in the 2026 primary elections to any Republican lawmaker who opposed the president-elect.\nHis social media postings came after Musk blasted the bipartisan package reached by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to fund the government through March 14. When the government last had a partial shutdown for five weeks starting at the end of 2018, the CBO estimated it cut economic growth by $3 billion, a small but symbolic sum.\nBy Thursday, Trump was claiming on social media that a new deal reached among Republicans was a “SUCCESS” because it would push the debt ceiling out until January 30, 2027. He insisted that Democrats “do what is best for Country,” but the White House and leading Democratic lawmakers came out against the proposal.\nDemocrats were also quick to seize on the seeming Republican dysfunction, with Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., saying, ”Trump’s made a lot of promises, but he’s also going to be accountable for the impact he’s having on families.”\n“I guess Elon Musk is making the decisions now, because Republicans in Congress are incapable of making decisions on their own,\" DelBene said in an interview. \"They just wait for someone to tell them what to do.”\nTrump won the election, but public still wary\nTrump's ability to project strength and assure voters that he would reduce inflation helped him win November's election. Stocks initially climbed on the prospect of tax and regulatory cuts, but Trump still faces a skeptical public and appears to be starting his presidency from a more delicate position than Biden did four years ago.\nMost U.S. adults — 54% — have an unfavorable view of Trump, according to the latest survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey found that small majorities have slight to no confidence in his ability to manage the White House or government spending. By contrast, Biden began his presidency with an approval rating above 60% only to see it steadily decline as inflation worsened.\nIn a sense, Trump has to preserve the momentum of an economy still recovering from pandemic-era distortions while going through a series of tough policy choices. First, there is the need to increase the government's legal borrowing authority that he insists be part of any short-term funding bill in order to avoid a shutdown. He will also push to renew his 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire after next year. On top of that, there is a budget deficit that has become less sustainable with higher interest rates.\n“The U.S. economy is in very good shape — it has a strong underlying growth trend,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. “All of the risks are policy risks. They’re risks that the Fed didn’t get it right, risks that come with the clock — we’ve got to do the debt ceiling, we’ve got to fund the government.”\nIn a speech this month at the Brookings Institution, Biden took stock of the roughly 3% economic growth and the inflation rate easing since its 2022 spike, saying Trump would come into office with a solid economy. But he also warned that the policies of Trump allies in the form of tariffs and deportations could unleash an “economic disaster.”\nThe president never translated his investments in infrastructure, renewable energy and new factories into political momentum. But he said “it’s going to be politically costly and economically unsound for the next president to disrupt or cut” those programs.\nTrump is also inheriting a higher national debt from Biden that could limit the benefits and scope of his planned tax cuts. When he was last president in 2020, the government was spending $345 billion annually to service the debt. That cost now exceeds $1 trillion. On Thursday, the president-elect said on social media that the federal government “will cut Hundreds of Billions of Dollars in spending next year” in an effort to fund his tax cuts and limit deficits.\nThe Fed sees uncertainty ahead\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told reporters at a Wednesday news conference that some members of the central bank's rate-setting committee started to incorporate the possible effects of Trump's policies into their economic forecasts.\nBut Powell stressed that there is a lack of clarity about what Trump would do. It's unknown whether he would deliver on tariff threats against Canada, Mexico, China and Europe. Nor is there much official guidance on how Trump would fund tax cuts that could add $4.6 trillion to deficits over a decade.\n“Some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their writing down more uncertainty around inflation,” Powell said. “The point about uncertainty is it’s kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower.\"\nPowell added for emphasis about what happens with uncertainty: \"It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.”"

        "article_content": "Kamala Harris has been releasing her plans for the \"care economy\" in piecemeal fashion — a strategy very much unlike the other planks of her economic agenda.\nThe latest slice came Tuesday with a proposal to expand care for seniors.\n\"What we will do is allow Medicare to cover in-home healthcare,\" said Harris during an appearance on ABC's \"The View\" to immediate applause from the studio audience.\n\"It is a way to help people not just get by but get ahead,\" she added Tuesday during a wide-ranging interview that also touched on issues from Hurricane Milton to Saturday Night Live.\nIt was the latest in a series of announcements from the vice president’s campaign — often done strategically before interested audiences — where she has promised efforts to have the government take on an increasing role in the care of Americans from young children to seniors if she is elected. The pitches are notably tailored to those in the middle.\nThe new proposal released Tuesday would establish an expanded home care benefit through the Medicare program to help families afford caring for seniors at home instead of turning to nursing facilities.\nIt's a plan with a clear appeal for seniors. But Harris aimed her pitch Tuesday to their kids, often called the \"sandwich generation\" because they are middle-aged Americans tasked with helping a parent aged 65 or older while also raising children.\nIt's a cohort that includes nearly a quarter of American adults and a large number of undecided voters.\n\"There are so many people in our country who are right in the middle,\" Harris added in a direct appeal to the group Tuesday. \"It's just almost impossible to do it all.\"\nThis week's news from Harris came amid a wider media blitz from the vice president where the previously somewhat press-shy candidate appeared in an array of venues.\nThey ranged from the massively popular \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast — where she focused on reproductive rights — to a \"60 Minutes\" interview on CBS that covered national and international issues.\nOther \"pillars\" of Harris's economic plans have been given their own week of focus — from cost of living to entrepreneurship to manufacturing — but the care economy elements have been released more gradually, with a fuller picture now in focus.\nIt was in August that Harris, as part of that cost-of-living plan, announced financial supports for parents in the form of a new $6,000 tax credit for the first year of a child's life.\nThen, in a September interview hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), Harris offered support for the notion of capping childcare costs at 7% of working families' incomes.\nThat aligns Harris with legislation Democrats are pushing on the issue that would use the tax system to lower costs and provide new government grants to increase the supply of childcare providers.\nThe cost would be worth it, Harris told the NABJ, because it allows more people to work. \"It strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable childcare, affordable home healthcare, and extending the child tax credit,\" she said.\nHarris offered a few more details in an 82-page summary of her economic plans released in recent weeks with a chapter focused on ideas for families \"having to choose between the jobs they need and the people they love.\"\nThe focus this week was clearly on the so-called sandwich generation that Pew has defined as Americans in their 40s and 50s with responsibilities both for a parent aged 65 or older and a younger child (or financially supporting a grown child over 18).\nThe federal government — via the Medicare program — currently provides minimal assistance for things like home health aides for seniors. Democrats have long pushed to expand Medicare benefits but have fallen short, including in recent years during negotiations over the Biden/Harris \"Build Back Better\" agenda.\nBut Harris is now promising another run at the issue, promising a plan that covers home care \"for all of our nation’s seniors and those with disabilities on Medicare who need it,\" according to a campaign document.\nHarris said she will pay for it with the savings from expanding Medicare's power to negotiate prescription drug prices.\nThe Donald Trump campaign has also discussed home care benefits, including in a GOP platform that promised \"Republicans will shift resources back to at-home Senior Care, overturn disincentives that lead to Care Worker shortages, and support unpaid Family Caregivers through Tax Credits and reduced red tape.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Trump campaign charged that Harris was \"once again following President Trump's lead.\"\nThe larger context is a battle for undecided voters, especially those focused on the perennial polling question of which candidate \"cares about people like you.\"\nA new New York Times/Siena poll released Tuesday showed Harris with an 8-point edge on the issue.\nOf likely voters in that poll, 49% said it was Harris who cares more, while 41% said the same of Donald Trump.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Stocks are near all-time highs, and investors think interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve are around the corner.\nAn overarching feeling of optimism about both the economy and markets emerges from the third volume of the Yahoo Finance Chartbook, a trend similar to that seen in volume two in late January.\nAcross the 32 charts compiled by economists and strategists on Wall Street, we see broad confidence that the US economy can still achieve the vaunted \"soft landing\" outcome following the Fed's historic rate-hiking cycle.\nFollowing a nearly 17% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) so far this year, equity strategists see room for the bull market to run further, as many areas of the market have only recently joined the rally.\nHowever, just past the midpoint of 2024, there is some doubt about how long this can last without significant changes.\nThe risks aren't hard to find with the US presidential election looming. A stock market pullback is more than overdue, according to some market data. And a resilient economy continues to straddle the fine line between normalization from pre-pandemic trends and the start of a broader slowdown.\nEconomists are clamoring for changes to monetary policy to ensure the Fed can land the plane safely. Investors are also highlighting new opportunities and a potential stock market rotation as artificial intelligence enthusiasm moves into its next phase.\nThis volume of the Chartbook reflects markets and the economy at what Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius called an \"inflection point,\" where many things appear the same for now — but almost everything seems on the cusp of looking quite different.\nThe case for cutting rates | The state of the bull market | A pending US presidential election | The health of the US economy | The market's next move\nThe following commentary has been edited for length and clarity. \nClick here to download YF Chartbook Vol. 3 (Open Link in New Tab on desktop)\n\"Stubborn inflation during the first quarter dashed hopes for aggressive policy easing this year. That said, inflation remains below its June 2022 peak, and disinflationary momentum has regathered steam in recent months. In fact, headline inflation rose by just 3.0% y/y in June, well below the 3.5% pace recorded just three months prior.\n\"While food and energy prices have been well-behaved and core goods have been a steady source of disinflation, gains in shelter and auto insurance have remained elevated, prolonging inflation’s journey back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. However, with real-time data across both categories pointing to easing price pressures, inflation should continue its slow descent and return to 2% by the middle of next year. If, as expected, inflationary pressures ease through the summer, the Federal Reserve should feel comfortable cutting rates twice this year, delivering a first cut in September.\"\n\"Contrary to the predictions of some prominent economists but consistent with our own work and that of Fed Governor Christopher Waller, the normalization of the US labor market over the last two years has occurred in a very benign fashion, with a large decline in the job openings rate and only a negligible increase in the unemployment rate. In the jargon of labor economics, we have moved down the steep post-pandemic Beveridge curve and are back to the flatter pre-pandemic Beveridge curve. This means we may be approaching an inflection point at which further softening in labor demand results in a bigger and much less welcome increase in unemployment.\"\n\"The most important chart — and the impetus for the change to our [call for a September rate cut] — is the latest rental inflation data from [this month's] CPI release. The drop in primary rents and owners' equivalent rents in the June CPI data is a 'game changer' and should meaningfully boost Fed officials' confidence that inflation remains on a trajectory back to its 2% target. To be sure, the Fed will likely want to see a couple more prints to confirm the downshift, but historically, rents have been fairly sticky — i.e., when you have a shift in either direction from [a] prior trend, it tends to persist.\"\n\"Inflation, as measured by the harmonized consumer expenditure deflator, is firmly below the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Harmonized inflation excludes the implicit cost of homeownership, also known as owners' equivalent rent. Measuring OER is vexed in typical times but is intractable in current times given the upside-down housing market. It is understandable the Fed doesn’t want to change the inflation measure it is targeting at this time and risk its credibility, but Fed officials should call out harmonized inflation as critical to watch. By so doing, it will make it easier for the Fed to make the case that inflation is where it needs to be for them to do the right thing and lower interest rates.\"\n\"Given unfavorable year-on-year comparisons, PCE inflation is likely to hover around an 'uncomfortable plateau' around 2.6%-2.7% over the summer. While softer consumer spending growth due to increased pricing sensitivity, moderating wage growth, declining rent inflation, reduced markups, and stronger productivity growth will continue to provide a healthy disinflationary impulse, it's not until September that inflation readings will fall below that uncomfortable plateau. We foresee headline and core PCE inflation ending the year around 2.5% [year over year].\"\n\"We expect the contribution from fiscal [policy] to the growth rate of the US economy should moderate over time, down from the substantial contributions it made in the last six quarters. And, to a lesser degree, business spending should follow the same path. This is part of the reason we assume growth moderates and inflation decelerates.\"\n\"The Fed, Powell, and others have cited these series as benchmarks for easier labor market conditions. These two series support the argument the Fed will ease in September.\"\nClick here to download YF Chartbook Vol. 3 (Open Link in New Tab on desktop)\n\"Over multiple periods during the past year, a historically low percentage of the S&P 500 has outperformed the index itself while churn/rotations/weakness under the surface remains acute. The better-than-expected [June] CPI report unleashed some rotation into smaller-cap stocks, and we think there will be continued bouts of that rotation. However, we recommend staying up in quality when going down the cap spectrum.\"\n\"This chart shows how the market has been trading three groups of potential AI beneficiaries. The first group is stocks with revenues tied to investment in AI infrastructure, including semiconductor firms, cloud providers, and data centers, among others. The second is companies with the potential to monetize AI by generating incremental revenues. The third group contains the companies with the biggest potential earnings boost from AI-driven productivity gains. So far, investors have expressed confidence in the trajectory of AI investment, with those beneficiaries outperforming the average S&P 500 stock by nearly 30 percentage points so far this year. However, the flat performance of the other groups signals that investors remain skeptical about the longer-term impacts of AI adoption.\"\n\"Low expected volatility, as measured by the CBOE VIX Index, is a common feature of bull markets. This was the case in the mid-1990s, mid-2000s, and much of the 2010s. Many market observers are worried the VIX is too low, signaling unhealthy complacency. We disagree, and the history of Wall Street's 'Fear Index' supports our view.\"\n\"This chart is our way of measuring how much growth markets are pricing into current index levels. Right now, we are near post-pandemic highs. This means market expectations are high for fundamentals. Basically, you need strong earnings results and follow-through in guidance to support the market or push it higher [at] these levels.\"\n\"This chart shows the relationship over the last 10 years between high-yield corporate spreads and large versus small stock performance. Historically, large-cap stocks (higher quality) tend to outperform smaller-cap stocks (lower quality) when high-yield credit spreads are widening (high-quality bonds outperform low-quality bonds). However, the relationship has reversed since the end of 2022. Large-cap stocks have outperformed smaller stocks despite credit spreads narrowing. This is quite rare and conflicts with sound economic theory.\"\n\"On July 16, the Russell 2000 closed 4.42 standard deviations above its 50-day moving average. That was not only the most overbought reading that the Russell 2000 has seen on a closing basis in its history, but for major US Indices (S&P 500, DJIA, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000), it is the most overbought reading in history!\nWe've discussed in the past how the size of the Russell 2000 in terms of its market cap (smaller than Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia) could make it susceptible to large swings.\"\n\"AI and the low-carbon transition could spur historically large capital spending — and in a much shorter space of time than previous technological revolutions. We see a possible investment boom ahead that could transform economies and markets. But the speed, scale, and impact of that investment is unclear.\"\n\"The de-stocking cycle over the past 18-24 months has been one of the sharpest in history, with inventory levels for the S&P 500 falling as much as it did during the prior three recessions. But the sharp inventory contraction started to moderate for the third straight month in June, suggesting that the de-stocking cycle is likely coming to an end.\"\nKathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist, Schwab Center for Financial Research \n\"With the Treasury yield curve inverted, many investors have been reluctant to extend duration in their bond portfolios because it would mean giving up yields of more than 5%. However, staying too short increases reinvestment risk. We have been encouraging investors to look beyond the Treasury market for yield. Currently, there are opportunities to build a portfolio of yields 5% or more over the next 5 to 10 years without taking significant credit risk. Investment grade corporate bonds, agency mortgage-backed securities, and/or the Aggregate Bond Index provide the chance to capture higher yields for longer without dropping below investment grade.\"\nClick here to download YF Chartbook Vol. 3 (Open Link in New Tab on desktop)\n\"Oxford Economics has modeled the macroeconomic impact of various possible election outcomes. No matter the result on Election Day, policymaking during the next presidential term will add to inflation. However, the magnitude of the inflationary boost will depend on the president and the makeup of Congress. The inflationary impact is greatest in a 'full-blown Trump' scenario where a Republican trifecta doubles down on tax cuts, higher defense spending, and tariffs. Even in a 'limited Trump' scenario, where a Republican trifecta doesn’t loosen fiscal policy or raise tariffs to the same extent, inflation is still meaningfully higher. In our 'baseline [Democrat]' scenario, a Democratic trifecta would expand government social benefits and partially pay for them with higher corporate taxes; inflation is higher in this scenario too. Ultimately, the inflationary boost is least under a divided government and under our 'full-blown [Democrat]' scenario, where a Democratic trifecta doubles down on tax increases.\"\n\"Schwab strategists made a great observation about the importance of staying invested. If you started with $10,000 in 1961 and invested in the S&P 500 only when there was a Republican in the White House, your investment would've grown to $102,000 in 2023. If you did the same but with a Democrat in the White House, that investment would've grown to $500,000. But none of that compares with the $5.1 million you would've had if you had stayed invested the whole time, regardless of who was president. It speaks to the power of compound interest and what can happen if you miss out on it.\"\n\"The chart highlights the impact the supply of longer-run Treasury bonds was having on bond yields. The vertical lines are the Treasury funding announcements last year. The rising debt issuance appeared to pressure yields higher. Then, at the November announcement, the Treasury Department announced shifting issuance to short-term bills, weighing on longer-term bond yields. This could have implications for the coming expiration of the 2017 tax cuts and impact on markets of sustaining large deficits over time.\"\nClick here to download YF Chartbook Vol. 3 (Open Link in New Tab on desktop)\n\"We think the labor market is normalizing from the pandemic shock and do not see a recession materializing on the horizon. While the Sahm Rule approaches its recession trigger (when the three-month moving average of unemployment rises 0.5 percentage points above its low of the past year), we believe the flood of illegal immigration and the growing labor force are behind the rise in unemployment. Using the insured unemployment rate from weekly jobless claims data, which excludes new workers entering the labor force, we see little cause for concern that the labor market is cracking.\"\n\"According to the JOLTS data, 47.7 million people quit their jobs in 2021, and an additional 50.6 million quit their jobs in 2022. This compares with an average of 37.9 million annually for the 5-year period leading up to the pandemic in 2020 (2015-2019). ... Businesses spent enormous amounts of money on investment in human resources services to find employees, and then on increased wage costs. Often, these investments barely maintained headcount/capacity and did not generate more. By definition, this is a drag on productivity.\n\"Recent JOLTS data shows that turnover is slowing. The 'Great Resignation' has transitioned to 'The Big Stay.' The drag on productivity caused by labor market turnover will continue to reverse as workers stay in their jobs longer and build up skills, efficiency, and experience. As productivity improves, businesses will have less pressure to pass on higher wage costs to customers through higher prices, allowing inflation to cool further.\"\n\"In more than 60 years, there has never been a recession without real discretionary spending falling on a year-over-year basis. What about false positives? Turns out, they are rare. It has only happened twice; both were short trips across the zero line and the most recent was more than 35 years ago in 1987 (the other was 1967). Household spending habits these days reveal a more choosey consumer as purchasing power fades. Real non-discretionary spending has outpaced discretionary purchases on trend in recent months, consistent with a moderation in broader consumption. Real discretionary spending growth has been awfully close to breaking through the zero line this year.\"\n\"Yes, inflation is up more than anyone would like, but it might surprise many that disposable incomes and employee compensation have increased more than overall inflation since the pandemic started. This is one of the main reasons we haven’t had a recession when so many expected it. The good news is we expect inflation to improve the second half of this year, so consumers should remain in good shape as incomes and compensation remain healthy.\"\n\"Even after adjusting for higher prices, consumer spending has risen solidly in recent years and is near its pre-COVID trend. That's remarkable, given the depth of the recession and the subsequent spike in inflation. In the first half of 2024, the growth in real consumer spending slowed, following a robust pace in 2023. So far, that appears to be nothing unusual, but as two-thirds of the US economy, consumers will be at the center of any watch over recession risks.\"\n\"Is changing jobs worth what it used to be? In addition to finding that the rate of workers changing jobs (job-to-job (J2J) change rate) has declined relative to 2023, job hoppers are getting a smaller bump in pay from their new employers. During the height of the 'Great Resignation,' the median pay raises workers received when they changed jobs rose to above 20%, but as of May 2024, median pay raises for J2J movers moderated to less than half that level — around 10% YoY — and below the 2019 and 2020 average annual levels.\"\n\"Even before the pandemic, the pay raise from switching jobs into a long-distance role, which is when a worker lives in a different metro than their manager, was typically greater than from switching into a local one. A couple of years after the pandemic, we started seeing something new: The advantage of switching into a long-distance role — about 8% before the pandemic — roughly doubled!\n\"Thicker job markets — ones that have a greater variety of both jobs and candidates — allow people and employers to better match with each other and to share the extra value that those better matches create. When the pandemic normalized long-distance work, the result was an explosion in the variety of both jobs and candidates available, or in other words: a thicker market for those embracing long-distance work. No doubt, long-distance work will also have its fair share of disadvantages, but for the economy at large, it could prove to be a newfound source of efficiency, growth, and well-being. For a fuller account, see here.\"\nClick here to download YF Chartbook Vol. 3 (Open Link in New Tab on desktop)\n\"Earnings are the anchor for equity prices. The bottom-up analyst consensus and our earnings forecasts both see continued solid earnings growth and further upside for equities by year-end. How much? The forward consensus for S&P 500 EPS looks to be pointing to 5,500 and our earnings forecasts to 5,800 by year-end, but where equity prices end relative to earnings (the multiple) will depend also on the perceived speed and durability of the earnings cycle to come.\"\n\"Rate cuts are probably coming soon. And yes, they tend to happen when the economy is in trouble. But you don't need to freak out just yet. Rate cuts tend to happen in crises, when the Fed has to swoop in and save the economy through drastic changes in interest rates.\n\"But rate cuts can also happen when the Fed just needs to make a small adjustment to policy. You know, take the foot off the brake pedal to get to a cruising speed on the highway. A rate cut is just a rate cut — not a sign that something ominous is on the horizon. And this particular rate cut looks to be a celebratory rate cut — one that happens because the Fed believes they finally have inflation under control. In today's environment, that’s definitely worth celebrating.\"\n\"The relationship between monetary policy and technology stocks is an important one to consider, especially since we are close to the start of rate cuts. Tech stocks are considered a ‘long duration’ asset class, which means their cash flows are considered more distant and therefore they are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates. It is assumed that lower rates are more positive for higher duration stocks such as technology stocks.\n\"However, if we look at the last twenty-five years of performance of the NASDAQ Composite Index, it is clear that the relationship is more nuanced. Tech stocks were more sensitive to monetary policy tightening when their valuations were higher relative to history.\n\"Currently, the P/E ratio on the NASDAQ 100 is 32.72, which is higher than the historical average but not at the high end of the historical range of valuations. Therefore, I suspect that tech stocks will not be as sensitive to rate cuts going forward. I expect small caps and cyclical stocks to outperform tech stocks as markets anticipate an economic re-acceleration in coming months — but I still expect tech stocks to react positively to rate cuts.\"\n\"We’ve been bullish on equities in 2024, with the view that we’re in a “softilocks” backdrop of softening macro activity and moderating inflation. This helps to bring down interest rates and provide room for the Fed to cut rates, something that will continue to propel the bullish soft landing narrative for stocks and the economy.\"\n\"We are still skeptical that the 5.5% drawdown that occurred during March-April will be the worst for the S&P 500 this year given historical data that shows an average drawdown of 9.4% for the second year of bull markets historically. However, we are now convinced that should a more severe pullback happen over the near term, it will likely occur at higher index levels than we previously anticipated. Therefore, the eventual rebound, which has averaged roughly 14.5% historically, will begin at a higher base, suggesting to us that stocks have plenty of room to run through year-end.\"\n\"Since 1950, there have been 27 years where the S&P 500 gained more than 10% in the first half on a total return basis, such as what occurred this year. In the second half following these periods, the S&P 500 has averaged an additional gain of 9%. The index has risen in 24 of 27 such periods, despite seeing an average peak-to-trough pullback of 9% at some point.\"\nClick here to download YF Chartbook Vol. 3 (Open Link in New Tab on desktop)\nThis project would not be possible without the work of Yahoo Finance Senior Editor Brent Sanchez, who turned Wall Street jargon into a digestible visual presentation of the current market moment.

The Gross Domestic Product, a widely used measure of the economy’s entire output by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, will likely grow at an annual rate of 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to a November survey of economists by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.The same economists foresaw a 22.4% chance of a quarter of negative growth by the third quarter of 2025, down from 25% who said the same in the previous round of the quarterly survey. Solid consumer spending and a resilient labor will continue to prop up the economy in the coming year, economists at Goldman Sachs said in a year-ahead forecast in November.Experts are growing increasingly confident the U.S. will pull off the historically rare “soft landing” from the burst of high inflation that strained household budgets as the country re-opened from the pandemic.\nThe Federal Reserve’s campaign of interest rate hikes starting in 2022 was meant to cool inflation by raising all kinds of borrowing costs, at the risk of sending the economy into a tailspin and causing a wave of layoffs. In 2022 and 2023, many economists predicted a recession was on the horizon, as usually happens after a cycle of inflation and anti-inflation rate hikes.Instead, inflation has cooled almost back to pre-pandemic levels while the job market has stayed resilient. The economy has continued to grow to the point that the Fed has begun to lower rates again.\nIf the growth rate matches the 1.9% forecast, it would be somewhat slower than the 2.6% median growth rate in the five years up to the pandemic. The economy grew faster after a massive downturn in 2020 and grew at a  3.1% annual rate in the third quarter, according to the latest estimate.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is a wildcard in the economic outlook, especially because of his campaign promise to impose high and broad tariffs on imports, especially those from China. \nForecasters at Goldman Sachs expect him to impose only limited tariffs, which they expect would have a minor effect on the economy. However, economists believe that heavy tariffs, in line with Trump's promise, could drive up prices for all kinds of products, stoke inflation, and drag down the economy.“The biggest risk is a large across-the-board tariff, which would likely hit growth hard,” Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman, together with other economists, wrote in a commentary.Still, Goldman's forecasters are among the more optimistic and expect the economy to grow at a healthy 2.5% annual rate in 2025.\nRead the original article on Investopedia"

        "article_content": "With Kamala Harris as a late addition to the upcoming presidential race, there’s a rush to learn about her policies, particularly those surrounding the economy. Harris’s economic platform and policies mirror Biden’s, so the economic impact is likely similar to what was expected had Biden become the Democratic nominee for president.\nNext: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for the Job Market If Kamala Harris Wins the Election\nAlso: 6 Subtly Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nHarris has not been shy about her economic priorities. In a speech to the American Federation of Teachers on July 25, 2024, she said, “In our vision of the future, we see a place where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead – a future where no child has to grow up in poverty, where every senior can retire in dignity, and where every worker has the freedom to join a union.”\nHere are some of Kamal Harris’s campaign platform’s major economic planks and how they will impact the national economy.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Child Tax Credit was expanded from $2,000 to $3,000 per child, with an extra $600 for children under six in 2021. This reduced child poverty to 5.2%, a historic low. In 2022, when the pandemic relief expired, child poverty surged again to 12.4%.\nThe Biden administration has supported restoring the tax credit to 2021 levels since it has been proven to slash child poverty rates. But the bill to do so has not passed the Senate. Harris may make the passage of this bill a priority for her administration.\nI’m an Economist: Here’s What Could Happen to Wage Workers if Kamala Harris Is Elected in 2024\nAs a California senator, Harris proposed the LIFT the Middle-Class Act, or Livable Incomes for Families Today. This bill proposed a tax credit of up to $3,000 per person for middle and low-income workers. This would have reduced the income tax paid by $3,000 per person or $6,000 per couple for those who meet the income threshold. Harris proposed this bill in 2018, and the cost of living has significantly increased since then.\nHarris may not propose LIFT again as president, but she would likely sign a similar proposal if it were passed by Congress.\nHarris has even more enthusiastic support from labor unions than Biden did and rapidly picked up endorsements from the American Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International Union, and the granddaddy of them all, the AFL-CIO.\nUnder the Biden administration, labor unions have been able to secure higher wages and better benefits for their workers, and more workers have been able to unionize. This seems likely to continue and even expand in a Harris administration.\nIn addition to her widely publicized support for abortion care and women’s bodily autonomy, Harris has also expressed her commitment to protecting the Affordable Care Act and increasing subsidies. She’s also a supporter of expanding Medicare in those states that have not already done so.\nMuch has been said during this election cycle about the precariousness of Social Security benefits. With the country’s aging population and large numbers of Baby Boomers retiring every day, many voters are concerned about the ability of this system to provide income for them when they need it.\nHarris supports the Biden administration’s position against cutting Social Security benefits and against privatizing Social Security. She has also said that she will increase the cost of living adjustments so that benefits more closely align with the needs of seniors today.  In order to provide the funding needed for these policies, Harris has suggested revising the current limit on earnings that are subject to social security tax, now set at $168,600. Harris would require earnings above $250,000 per year to also be subject to Social Security tax.\nA cornerstone of Biden’s platform has been the promise not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year, and Harris plans to continue that pledge. In order to pay for her ambitious social service programs, taxes will have to be raised on those earning over $400,000 per year, or about 3% of taxpayers.\nLike Biden, Harris supports measures that will support middle-class families. Years of so-called trickle-down economics have failed to deliver the promised gains, so Harris hopes to reverse that trend by increasing taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations to fund programs that improve the quality of life of middle — and lower-income families.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon is concerned the US economy could be in for a repeat of the problems that hampered the country during the 1970s.\n\"Yes, I think there’s a chance that can happen again,\" he said during an appearance Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York.\nThe economy in that troubled decade was constrained by stagflation, a combination of low growth and high inflation, and Dimon said such a risk exists again.\n\"I worry that it looks more like the '70s than we've seen before,\" he added during a question and answer session with Marie-Josée Kravis, chair of the Museum of Modern Art and wife of KKR co-founder Henry Kravis.\n\"There are circumstances in which it'll look more like the '70s than what we've had for the last 20 years.\"\nThe CEO of the largest US bank has been warning for months about a number of risks to a resilient US economy that could lead to \"stickier inflation and higher rates than markets expect,\" as he put it in an April 8 letter to shareholders.\nFederal Reserve officials backed up that view in the last week as Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several of his colleagues pivoted from earlier assurances about rate cuts and made it clear that rates were likely to stay elevated for longer than expected due to hotter-than-expected inflation.\nDimon said in his April 8 letter that the bank is prepared for interest rates \"from 2% to 8% or even more\" — and he repeated that prediction Tuesday.\n\"We would handle stagflation too,\" he added.\nEarlier this month, JPMorgan reported first quarter results that showed higher interest rates are posing more of a challenge even for the country’s largest bank.\nDespite posting profits that rose 6% from a year earlier, beating analyst expectations, the bank said a key revenue source known as net interest income came in lower than expected from the previous quarter.\nIt was the bank’s first sequential drop in that key revenue source in nearly three years, and the bank attributed the decrease to \"deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances.\"\nDimon returned to some other familiar subjects during his discussion Tuesday, including his concerns about large amounts of government spending and efforts by the Fed to shrink its balance sheet, as well as the ongoing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and their potential to disrupt essential commodities markets, migration, and geopolitical relationships.\nAt the same time, he described the US economy as \"booming\" and hailed the resilient state of the American consumer, US bank credit, home prices, and stock prices.\nEconomic growth, he said, is key to solving any number of problems.\n\"We need to do more and better, and that's why we need to grow the economy,\" he said.\nHe was asked whether he would be interested in serving in government, a question he has downplayed a number of times in the past.\nHe then repeated a facetious statement he has made before about his aversion to the election process: \"I always said I would love to be president, but you would have to anoint me.\"\nHe didn’t drop any hints about when he might leave JPMorgan, saying only that he wants to \"leave behind\" a \"great company\" and \"I want to help my country.\"\n\"I am very excited about the future.\"\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "President Joe Biden came into office in 2021 with a strong economy that gradually weakened as inflation hammered Americans’ purchasing power. With inflation now fading, the Biden economy is once again looking as solid as it did when Biden’s term first began.\nSince July, the Biden economy has improved two notches on the Yahoo Finance Bidenomics Report Card, from a B+ to a solid A. That’s the same mark our report card gave the economy during Biden’s first month in office, in January 2021.\nOur Bidenomics Report Card tracks six metrics using data provided by Moody’s Analytics: total employment, manufacturing employment, real earnings adjusted for inflation, exports, the stock market’s performance, and GDP growth per capita. In each of those categories, we compare performance under the current president with seven prior presidents going back to Jimmy Carter in the 1970s at the same point in their first term. (Here’s our full methodology.)\nCompared with those prior presidents, the Biden economy is strongest in three out of six categories: employment, manufacturing employment, and GDP growth. The Biden economy is third out of eight in stock performance and second out of five in exports (that data only goes back to 1993).\nThe weakest mark for Biden has come in average hourly earnings, because high inflation in 2022 and 2023 eroded the value of a typical paycheck. For seven months in 2022, Biden’s score on earnings was the lowest of the eight presidents.\nBut inflation has dropped from a peak of 10% in 2022 to just 2.4% now, which is close to normal. Real earnings growth under Biden flipped from negative to positive earlier this year, meaning that wages are once again growing by more than inflation. Biden now ranks third out of eight on real earnings growth, which is the main thing pushing his grade up.\nAn A grade on our report card isn’t exactly the same as a great economy. Since we’re comparing the current president to recent predecessors, our grade only reflects how he’s doing relative to them. There can still be notable weaknesses, such as housing and food costs that remain too high for many families on a budget.\nStill, our A grade is consistent with many other analyses of the current economy. Employers have created more than 16 million jobs under Biden, the most during any presidential term. Earlier this year, manufacturing employment hit a 16-year high. There hasn’t been a recession in more than four years, and Goldman Sachs recently lowered its 12-month recession odds from 20% to 15%, in line with the historical average.\nThere's also been a notable improvement in voter trust for Democrats on the economy since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden as the party's presidential candidate over the summer. In several polls, Harris's rating on the economy is higher than Biden's was just a few months ago. That could be because voters simply find Harris more engaging or accessible, or it could reflect actual improvements in the economy that ordinary people are starting to notice. Whatever the cause, it obviously comes at the right time for Harris, with Election Day less than a month off.\nThat makes comparisons between the Joe Biden and Donald Trump economies more important than any other past president. Biden is out, but Harris is still the incumbent responsible for the Democrats' record. Trump has his own record, dating to his own term as president, giving voters a backward-looking guide to whether Harris or Trump will be better for the economy.\nThe data gives Harris, via Biden, a clear edge in three categories and Trump an edge in two. You can see how the two compare by clicking on each tab in the charts above. The Biden-Harris economy is the blue line in each of the charts.\nBiden outdoes Trump in total employment, manufacturing employment, and GDP growth. At this point in Trump’s term, the COVID pandemic had triggered a deep, if brief, recession, which damaged Trump’s economic numbers. But Biden did better in all three categories even if you only compare the first three years of each term, excluding COVID from Trump’s record.\nTrump has done better on inflation and on real income growth, which is related to inflation. For voters who feel like the economy was better under Trump, that’s probably related to incomes that consistently rose by more than inflation, both before and after COVID.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nOn stock performance, Biden leads Trump by a bit at the moment, but they’ve gone back and forth on that. We don’t include exports among the charts above because it’s not intuitive to consumers, but Biden has a strong edge there too.\nOverall, the highest grade Trump earned when we ran the Trumponomics Report Card — with the same methodology as the Biden project — was an A-. Trump ended his term with a C because of the COVID disruptions. Barring anything disastrous, Biden seems likely to end his term next January with a B+ or better, and he could sustain the A grade he enjoys now.\nPartisans can come up with plenty of pet reasons why Biden or Trump is better for the economy. In reality, the US president has less control over the economy than many people think. The US economy is a gargantuan organism affected by thousands of inputs from all over the world, and presidential policies are a tiny fraction of those.\nThere’s an important caveat, however: the vast amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus Congress and the Federal Reserve enacted in 2020 and 2021 to jolt the economy out of a COVID depression. Most of that happened during Trump’s final year in office, which prevented the immediate downturn from being a lot worse. Much of that also carried into Biden’s term, powering spending, hiring, and growth beyond what it probably would have been otherwise.\nBiden signed yet another stimulus bill into law after taking office in 2021, which juiced the economy even more. That also contributed to the inflation that became Biden’s biggest economic vulnerability. And voters seem to have punished Biden more for high inflation than they rewarded him for a booming job market. Biden’s approval rating sank as inflation went up, but it never recovered as inflation came down. That leaves Biden with a huge asterisk next to his accurate claim of the most jobs created under any presidential term.\nWhatever voters remember about the Biden or Trump economies, the old investing maxim probably applies: Past results don’t guarantee future performance. The next president almost certainly won’t ride an economy gassed up by unprecedented stimulus measures the way Trump and Biden both did. During the next few years, the economy could be driven more by things Americans don't get to vote on than by the one they do.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "The US economy won't dodge a hard landing recession, according to Stephanie Pomboy.\nThe economist said US consumers are already in a recession.\nThat could be followed by a \"double-dip\" profit recession as corporate earnings take a hit.\nThe US economy can't avoid a hard-landing recession, according to one top economist.\nStephanie Pomboy, who worked at ISI for a decade before starting research firm MacroMavens, is among economists who warned of structural problems in housing and credit markets ahead of the 2008 crisis. She warned in a recent interview of a coming \"double-dip\" profit recession for US companies, which could cause earnings to nosedive and spark big problems for the economy.\nHer view stems from the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest-rate hikes, with central bankers raising rates 525 basis points over the course of 17 months to tackle inflation.\nAnd higher rates are likely here to stay for the time being, she said, despite investors pricing in hefty rate cuts to come later this year.\n\"We are not going to avert a hard landing,\" Pomboy said in a recent interview with Rosenberg Research. \"I think that this notion that the Fed could raise rates in record speed and magnitude on an economy, toting record leverage without economic or financial incident, is laughable.\"\nWhile some commentators have rolled back their recession calls, US consumers already look to be suffering from a downturn, Pomboy said. Retail sales have \"gone nowhere for two years\" and are already in recession territory when adjusted for inflation, she noted.\nThe consumer recession could soon be followed by a nosedive in corporate earnings, given that the full impact of Fed's rate hikes has yet to play out in the economy. That will hit firms with higher borrowing costs at a time when profits already look poised to weaken, Pomboy said.\nWhile stocks have soared nearly 30% over the past year, corporate earnings are up just 4%, she noted.\n\"We're actually going to have a double-dip profits recession. And again, that wherewithal to service higher cost debt is going to weaken substantially, and then we'll have real problems,\" she added.\nAccording to Pomboy, that could end up delivering a swift blow to stocks, which have crushed a series of record highs this year. Investors risk being disappointed with the timing of rate cuts in 2024.\n\"It does feel like it's an example of how much air there is under this market that can be quickly sucked out of there,\" she said of the market's expectations for rates to come down.\nPomboy's view mirrors that of other market commentators, who have warned stock prices are rising to unsustainable levels. Stocks are looking like they did prior to the dot-com and '08 market crashes, top economist David Rosenberg said in a previous note, suggesting the market is in a bubble poised to pop.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "article_content": "A lot happens in any given year, but especially in presidential election years. In 2024, inflation came down, Donald Trump won office for a second time (and the market reacted) and some other major economic changes occurred.\nHeading into 2025, it helps to know what’s happened in 2024. While these major changes aren’t necessarily signs of what’s to come, they certainly can be.\nHere are five big things that happened to the economy in 2024.\nCheck Out: The Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Retirees Should Make Before Inauguration Day\nRead Next: Renting vs. Owning a Home: Which Will Be Cheaper in 2025?\nInvestors and individuals alike have been worried about inflation, especially in recent years. In June 2022, inflation reached 9.1%, according to the BLS. A year later, it was around 3%.\nBy September of 2024, it’d fallen to 2.4%. Considering the target inflation rate is between 2% and 3%, this is surprisingly good news for U.S. consumers.\nLearn More: The Salary Needed To Afford America’s 50 Biggest Cities\nWhat happened on Nov. 5, 2024, can’t be overlooked either. After all, it was a pivotal day in American history — and it had quite an impact on markets, at least in the short term.\nIn reaction to Trump’s win, the S&P 500’s earnings grew by 13% over the year. On election day, earnings were at $5,783. Less than a week later, they were at $6,001 and have been steadily increasing since.\nMeanwhile, U.S. Treasury securities (10-year constant maturity) also went up. On Nov. 4, it was at 4.31. The day after the election, it was at 4.42.\nBitcoin has also seen a significant increase. On Nov. 4, it was at $69,122. The day after the election, it’d risen to $74,446 and has continued to rise ever since. This could be for any number of reasons, one of which could be that the cryptocurrency industry is currently anticipating deregulation under the Trump administration.\nNot all major market changes were a direct result of the presidential election, though that’s certainly had an impact on many areas of the economy.\nEarnings for the largest U.S. companies rose by 5.8% over the past 12 months. Wall Street, by comparison, only expected a 3.5% increase. Many industries have continued to outperform their previously anticipated rates but tech in particular has thrived, accounting for 30% of the total S&P 500 index’s earnings growth.\nNotably, commodities like gold (up 4.2%) and oil (up 4%) also rose higher than ever these past few months. Other areas that have seen significant increases this year include multiples (11% expansion), U.S. large cap equities (25% growth), high-yield bonds (8% increase), Bitcoin (12% increase) and private credit (8% growth).\nUnfortunately, it’s not all been good news. In 2024, many major companies saw an increase in mass layoffs.\nAccording to R&D World, 526 major companies across different sectors were impacted by these layoffs. The combined number of layoffs numbers nearly 150,000.\nBreaking this down further, Intel laid off 15,000 people, Tesla laid off 14,000, Dell laid off 12,500 and Cisco laid off 9,900. Even Amazon was affected, having cut its staff by 9,000. Many of these companies have incorporated AI into their business model, which may have had an impact on these increased layoffs.\nWhat’s worth noting is the overall national unemployment rate. U.S. Bureau of Statistics data shows that it was at 14.8% in April 2020 (during the height of the pandemic). By midway through 2022, it’d fallen to 3.7%. It’s risen somewhat since then to 4.2%.\nThe federal funds rate plays a key role in long-term financing interest rates — including mortgages. Generally, a higher rate means lenders will set higher interest rates as well. This in turn leads to increased financing costs and greater overall interest payments.\nAs of November 2024, the federal funds rate is 4.58%. For most of 2024, it was 5.33%. This overall decrease could be a good sign for those seeking a mortgage or other forms of financing.\nThe typical rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.6% as of Dec. 12, 2024. It’s fallen by 0.35% year-over-year. For 15-year fixed-rate mortgage loans, the average rate is 5.84%, a 0.54% one-year decrease.\nAlthough interest rates have gone down slightly, housing prices have not. As per Zillow data, the average U.S. home value is up 2.5% on the year at $357,469. The median existing home sales price is $407,200. A year ago, it was $391,600. During this time, existing home sales also increased by 3.4%.\nBetween the presidential election and ongoing changes in the U.S. economy, there’s also the potential for significant future changes going forward into 2025.\nAccording to JPMorgan, “The new administration is likely to bring significant change that could further support the recovery in deal-making and capital market liquidity. That could include replacing U.S. government agency leadership with personnel less inclined toward heavy regulation.”\nHowever, only time will tell.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nCostco, Walmart and Other Stores With Perks Retirees Need To Be Taking Advantage Of\n8 Common Mistakes Retirees Make With Their Social Security Checks\nThe Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Retirees Should Make Before Inauguration Day\n3 Things Retirees Should Sell To Build Their Retirement Savings\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 2024 Economy Review: 6 Big Things That Happened"

        "article_content": "A growing number of investors believe the US economy is headed for a \"no landing\" scenario, in which inflation doesn't reach the Fed's 2% target, but the US economy keeps growing.\nThirty-six percent of respondents to Bank of America's Global Fund Manager Survey, released on Tuesday, said they believe the most likely outcome for the global economy in the next 12 months is a \"no landing.\" This was a noted move higher from the 23% who saw the outcome a month ago and the highest level seen since June 2023, the earliest date on BofA's graph.\nMeanwhile, 54% of respondents believe a soft landing — where economic growth slows but not to the point of recession, and inflation returns to its historical average — is the most likely outcome.\nThis shows a shift in the discussion on Wall Street, as just 7% of respondents believe a hard landing, where restrictive policy forces the economy into recession, is the base case. Last year, much of the debate on Wall Street was whether a hard or soft landing was in the cards for the economy.\nNow, the debate has shifted to whether recent better-than-expected economic data could prohibit further progress on inflation.\n\"Recessions don't hit the US economy without a catalyst of some sort, and we just don't see what is going to stop consumer spending,\" Jefferies US economist Tom Simons wrote in a note on April 12. \"With demand still solid, it is hard to see how inflation will continue to slow down, and thus it is hard to see how the Fed can cut rates.\"\nOn Monday, retail sales data for March supported this point. Retail sales in the control group, which strips out volatile categories such as autos, building materials, and gas stations, increased 1.1% during the month. This measure feeds directly into GDP and, combined with revisions higher to February's release, prompted economists to boost their projections for economic growth in the first quarter.\nGoldman Sachs now believes quarter-over-quarter growth in the US economy hit 3.1%, up from a prior projection of 2.5%. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed's GDP Now tool now sees growth at 2.8% in the first quarter, up from a prior forecast of 2.4%.\nThese revisions higher come as expectations for inflation have also been on the rise after several hotter-than-expected consumer price readings through the first three months of the year. This has pushed an increasing number of economists to suggest the Fed may not cut rates this year, resulting in a \"no landing\" for 2024.\n\"The lack of moderation in consumer spending and inflation will undermine Fed officials’ confidence that inflation is on a sustainable course back to 2%,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote in a note on Monday. \"[Recent data] likely delays rate cuts to September at the earliest and could push off rate reductions to next year.\"\nThe market has been pricing in signs of a \"no landing\" scenario in recent weeks, according to Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson.\nWilson cited a recent surge in 10-year Treasury yields (^TNX) and a fall in interest rate-sensitive areas like the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) as examples. Such a scenario isn't bad for all areas of the stock market, Wilson noted, and could lead to a healthier backdrop for earnings growth.\n\"With rates now posing more of a risk to valuation, we prefer large cap areas of the market that are underpriced for a better than expected growth regime, such as large cap Energy,\" Wilson wrote.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "The US economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years last quarter as inflation topped Wall Street estimates.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis's advance estimate of first quarter US gross domestic product (GDP) showed the economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.6% during the period, missing the 2.5% growth expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The reading came in significantly lower than fourth quarter GDP, which was revised up to 3.4%.\nMeanwhile, the \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, grew by 3.7% in the first quarter, above estimates of 3.4% and significantly higher than 2% gain in the prior quarter.\nThe data's release comes as investors try to gauge when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates and if the central bank can achieve a soft landing, where inflation comes down to its 2% target without a significant economic downturn.\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n“This report pours cold water on the misleading narratives of a reaccelerating economy,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a research note following the print. \"As we enter the spring, the underlying growth mix continues to signal robust momentum, but demand growth is gently cooling leading to easing inflationary pressures.”\nEconomists pointed out that a large reason GDP for the first quarter came in softer than expected was weaker data in trade and exports, which together weighed on GDP growth for the quarter by about 1.2 percentage points.\n\"The deceleration in GDP growth will not worry the Fed as the details are better than the headline would suggest,\" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet said.\n\"The headline number really belies the underlying strength,\" Deutsche Bank senior US economist Brett Ryan told Yahoo Finance.\nRyan said the print doesn't cast further overall concern on a potential slowdown brewing in the US economy and believes areas like inventories and exports, which feed into GDP, will rebound next quarter.\nHe noted that the surprise rise in inflation was the \"big story\" from Thursday's data release, and markets seemed to agree.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added nearly seven basis points to reach above 4.7% for the first time since early November 2023.

        "title": "20 Countries with the Best Economy in the World in 2024",
        "date": "2024-10-01T02:02:09.000Z",
        "article_content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 Countries with the Best Economy in the World in 2024. If you want to skip our coverage of the current state of the global economy, then you can read 5 Countries with the Best Economy in the World in 2024.\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the global economic environment is far different in 2024 than it was in 2020. The world before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic was completely different. Back then, oil investors were fretting as green energy stocks were rising in popularity, high growth sectors were booming due to moderately low interest rates, and the stock market was dominated only by professional investors.\nNow, with interest rates all over the world coming down from historically high levels and the shakeup in global energy supply chains after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, not only have green energy stocks struggled, but high growth stocks (except for those with exposure to artificial intelligence) have also left investors desiring for more. These trends come after massive fluctuations in global GDP growth. During 2020, the global economy contracted by 2.9% which was the sharpest contraction on record since 1961 shows data from the World Bank. This outpaced the 1.4% drop in 2009, and after the lax monetary policy and stimulus spending were introduced in 2020, the economy sharply recovered in 2021 and stood at 6.3%.\nHowever, this was short lived since the Russian invasion of Ukraine would further complicate the economic picture in 2022. Stimulus spending and low rates fuel inflation, which was exacerbated by the disruption in the energy supply chain stemming from the invasion. In 2022, global GDP growth slowed down to 3.5% and slipped to 3.3% in 2023.\nOf course, since calculating global GDP growth is no small task, estimates of the metric often differ. So while the World Bank estimates 2023's GDP growth at 2.7%, estimates from the IMF and OECD share that it was 3.3% or 3.1%, respectively. However, while their estimates are slightly different, the one thing that the IMF and OECD agree on is that 2024 won't shock anyone by providing a growth uptick. Both claim that in 2024, global GDP growth will remain static and similar to 2023's figures. According to the OECD, while interest rates have made their mark on the housing and credit markets, overall, the global economy is continuing to show resilience, with inflation dropping and business confidence continuing to improve. Consequently, it estimates that the world GDP will grow by 3.2% in 2023 - which is similar to the IMF's figure.\nAdditionally, among the list of the world's strongest economies called the G20, only Japan and Argentina are expected to post negative growth in 2024. India will lead the world with its 6.7% annual growth, with Indonesia and China following in second and third places by posting 5.1% and 4.9% in GDP growth. In 2025, the OECD expects that India and Indonesia will continue to lead the world, and the Japanese economy will rebound through its 1.4% growth. The US GDP though is expected to slow down from 2.6% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025. Some of the OECD's caveats to this cautious optimism are a slower Chinese economy on the back of continued troubles in real estate and persistent inflation that forces central banks to keep policy rates high.\nREAD ALSO: 50 Biggest Economies in the World by the End of 2024 and Top 30 Largest Economies in the World by 2075.\nThe IMF, for its part, expects global inflation to drop from 6.7% in 2023 to 5.9% this year and 4.5% in the next. However, overall inflation will take some time to return to levels that central banks would prefer. As per the IMF, \"inflation in prices for services is now expected to be more persistent and commodity prices higher.\" Yet, the fund remains optimistic, as it adds that \"the gradual cooling of labor markets, together with an expected decline in energy prices, should bring headline inflation back to target by the end of 2025.\"\nShifting gears, GDP growth affects firms that are reliant on discretionary spending for their revenue. These range from those that sell home improvement equipment to others that sell sports apparel. One such firm is the home improvement products retailer The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD). Due to its focus on the construction industry, the firm benefits when homeowners and builders find it easy to spend on either new projects or renovations. This spending is dependent on inflation and interest rates, as they affect consumer budgets and developer financing. Consequently, when the Fed announced a 50 basis interest rate cut on September 18th, the firm's shares have gained 5.5% since then. Naturally, since the rate cut is fresh, year to September The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)'s stock didn't perform well despite the fact that it is one of the biggest home improvement retailers in America. Its shares were up a modest 6.8% by then, and a modest 14.4% over the past twelve months to lag the broader S&P by roughly 14 percentage points.\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)'s earnings for its first quarter saw same store sales drop for the sixth consecutive quarter. This was despite the fact that there have been no notable firm specific developments over the period, which led analysts to conclude that the drop is purely due to macroeconomic factors. During Q2, comparable sales fell by 3.3% annually for the seventh consecutive quarter as management shared that rate cut expectations were making buyers delay their spending. However, compared to its major competitor in the home improvement retail market, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) enjoys gross margin advantages. The firm's $152 billion in revenue and $51 billion in gross profit for the four latest quarters lead to a gross margin of 33.6%, which is higher than the rival's 33.2%.\nThis is despite the fact that the latter firm earned $84 billion in revenue and $28 billion in gross profit during the same period. With September 2023 ending with the much awaited interest rate cut, Piper Sandler shifted its sentiment for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)'s shares as it increased the share price target to $455 from $387 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. At the heart of the bullishness was a 136% annual jump in September refinance applications as 30 year mortgage rates dropped from 6.35% to 6.08%. The analysts shared that the anticipated growth in home improvement spending made HD quite an attractive stock.

They were ranked by their latest real GDP growth rates, and the top 20 countries with the highest growth were selected and re ranked using their nominal GDP. Using per capita figures and GDP size refines the list since it removes emerging or small economies that might have high growth but smaller economic size. If you're interested in the fastest growing economies, you should check out 20 Countries with the Highest Annual GDP Growth in the World to understand how the fastest growing economies might not necessarily be the best.\nGDP Growth: 1.80% \nGDP Value: $3.9 billion \nGDP Per Capita: $44,900 \nAndorra is one of the smallest countries in the world as it covers an area of 467 square kilometers.

South Korean firms like Samsung are global economic giants, and it has managed to keep a strong 2.3% GDP growth rate despite the size of its economy.\nGDP Growth: 2.70% \nGDP Value: $28.7 trillion \nGDP Per Capita: $85,370 \nAmerica's $28.7 trillion GDP is 3x the times of all other GDPs on our list combined. The total value of the ex-USA economies in our list of the best economies in the world is roughly $9.1 trillion, which isn't even half of the American output. America's economic crown jewel is its technology industry, as it houses all of the world's biggest technology companies. These firms have also led the world in the ongoing AI revolution, and the US's financial hub of Wall Street sets the tone for the global industry. American universities are among the best in the world, and its defense industry is the envy of dictatorships and repressive regimes who are often willing to go to extreme lengths to have a chance to enjoy the technological advantage that makes the US military the most formidable in the world.\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.

        "article_content": "The US economy continues to show signs of resilient growth while inflation pressures subside. \nBusiness activity grew at its fastest pace in 27 months during July, according to the latest S&P Global flash US composite PMI.\nThe composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, came in at 55 in July, up from 54.8 in June. Economists had expected the index to tick lower to 54.2.\nImportantly, the surprise growth in activity came alongside lower price increases. Average prices charged for goods and services rose at the slowest rate since January and the second-slowest rate since October 2020, according to S&P Global's report.\n“The flash PMI data signal a ‘Goldilocks’ scenario at the start of the third quarter, with the economy growing at a robust pace while inflation moderates,\" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in the release.\nWednesday's release is the latest in a string of data points that have investors increasingly confident the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates before a deterioration in the US economy, keeping the vaunted \"soft landing\" outcome to the Fed's hiking cycle in sight.\nAs of Wednesday morning, investors were pricing in a 100% chance the Fed cuts rates in September, per the CME FedWatch tool.\nServices drove the gains in the composite index, with the index rising to a reading of 56, its highest in 28 months. Meanwhile, activity in the manufacturing sector declined, hitting a reading of 49.5, its lowest print in seven months.\nAny reading above 50 for these indexes represents expansion in the sector; readings below 50 indicate contraction.\n\"Growth has become worryingly skewed, with manufacturing slipping back into contraction as the service sector gains further strength,\" Williamson said. \"Some of the production decline was linked to staff shortages, so could prove temporary — something which is supported by the sector reporting improved confidence about future growth prospects.\"\nBroadly, Williamson reasons that the metrics are still strong enough to translate to solid economic growth in the third quarter. Willamson noted that output across manufacturing and services is expanding at \"the strongest rate for over two years in July.\" This points to the economy growing at a 2.5% annualized rate in the third quarter, Williamson noted.\nThe first reading of second quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected on Thursday morning.

        "date": "2024-12-23T01:11:32.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Mark John\n(Reuters) - No sooner had the global economy started to put the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic behind it than a whole new set of challenges opened up for 2025.\nIn 2024, the world's central banks were finally able to start lowering interest rates after largely winning the battle against inflation without sparking a global recession.\nStocks hit record highs in the United States and Europe and Forbes declared a \"banner year for the mega-wealthy\" as 141 new billionaires joined its list of the super-rich.\nBut if this was supposed to be good news, someone forgot to tell voters. In a bumper election year, they punished incumbents from India to South Africa, Europe and the United States for the economic reality they were feeling: a merciless cost of living crisis brought on by cumulative post-pandemic price rises.\nFor many, it might get tougher in 2025. If a Donald Trump presidency enacts U.S. import tariffs that spark a trade war, that could mean a fresh dose of inflation, a global slowdown or both. Unemployment, currently near historic lows, could rise.\nConflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, political logjams in Germany and France, and questions over the Chinese economy further cloud the picture. Meanwhile, rising up the rank of concerns for many countries is the cost of climate damage.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nAccording to the World Bank, the poorest countries are in their worst economic state for two decades, having missed out on the post-pandemic recovery. The last thing they need are new headwinds - for example, weaker trade or funding conditions.\nIn richer economies, governments need to work out how to counter the conviction of many voters that their purchasing power, living standards and future prospects are in decline. Failure to do so could feed the rise of extremist parties already causing fragmented and hung parliaments.\nNew spending priorities beckon for national budgets already stretched after COVID-19, from tackling climate change to boosting armies to caring for ageing populations. Only healthy economies can generate the revenues needed for that.\nIf governments decide to do what they have been doing for years - simply piling on more debt - then sooner or later they run the risk of getting caught up in a financial crisis.\nWHAT IT MEANS FOR 2025\nAs European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said in her press conference after the ECB's final meeting of the year, there will be uncertainty \"in abundance\" in 2025.\nIt is still anyone's guess whether Trump will push ahead with tariffs of 10-20% on all imports, rising to 60% for Chinese goods, or whether those threats were just the opening gambit in a negotiation. If he goes ahead with them, the impact will depend on what sectors bear the brunt, and who retaliates.\nChina, the world's second-largest economy, faces mounting pressure to begin a deep transition as its growth impetus of recent years runs out of steam. Economists say it needs to end an over-reliance on manufacturing and put more money in the pockets of low-income citizens.\nWill Europe, whose economy has fallen further behind that of the United States since the pandemic, tackle any of the root causes - from lack of investment to skills shortages? First it will need to resolve political deadlocks in the two biggest euro zone economies, Germany and France.\nFor many other economies, the prospect of a stronger dollar - if Trump policies create inflation and so slow the pace of Federal Reserve rate cuts - is bad news. That would suck investment away from them and make their dollar-denominated debt dearer.\nFinally, add in the largely unknowable impact of conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East - both of which may have a bearing on the cost of energy which fuels the world's economy.\nFor now, policymakers and financial markets are banking on the global economy being able to ride all this out and central bankers completing the return to normal interest rate levels.\nBut as the International Monetary Fund signalled in its latest World Economic Outlook: \"Brace for uncertain times\".\n(Reporting by Mark John, Editing by Catherine Evans and Andrea Ricci)"

Economists had expected the index to tick up to 54.3. November's S&P composite PMI signaled the fastest expansion of business activity since April 2022.\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a press release that the data shows businesses' ramping activity amid a changing operating environment headed into 2025.\n“The business mood has brightened in November, with confidence about the year ahead hitting a two-and-a-half year high,\" Williamson said. \"The prospect of lower interest rates and a more pro-business approach from the incoming administration has fueled greater optimism, in turn helping drive output and order book inflows higher in November.\"\nThe uptick in activity was largely driven by the services sector. The services component of S&P's report showed the index registered 57 this month, up from 55 in October and the highest level in 32 months. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector remained in contraction with a reading of 48.8, up from 48.5, and the highest level in four months. Any reading above 50 for these indexes represents expansion in the sector; readings below 50 indicate contraction.\nStill, Williamson noted that the totality of the data points to another solid quarter of economic growth to end the year.\n\"The rise in the headline flash PMI indicates that economic growth is accelerating in the fourth quarter, while at the same time inflationary pressures are cooling,\" Williamson wrote. \"The survey's price gauge covering goods and services signaled only a marginal increase in prices in November, pointing to consumer inflation running well below the Fed's 2% target.\"\nThe upbeat projection on the US economy to end the year falls in line with current estimates for fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP). The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow Tool model, which incorporates data from the current quarter to project GDP, estimates the US economy will have grown at an annualized rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter.\nIn an economic outlook note sent to clients on Thursday, Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti increased his projections for GDP in 2025 in part due to the incoming Trump administration.\n\"Stronger momentum heading into 2025 combined with modest tax cuts, a deregulation push, and more supportive financial conditions should produce faster growth next year, which we now see at 2.5% versus 2.2% previously,\" Luzzetti wrote.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Minutes of the Fed's Nov. 6-7 policy meeting published on Tuesday showed officials appeared divided over how much farther they may need to cut rates.\n\"It is a closer call than it was at the prior two policy meetings since core services inflation remains sticky and could lead some Fed officials to argue for a pause in the rate cutting cycle next month,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"We instead look for the Fed to pause the rate cuts in early 2025 to assess prospective policy changes under the second Trump administration.\"\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% last month after an upwardly revised 0.6% advance in September, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would gain 0.3% after a previously reported 0.5% increase in September.\nAdjusted for inflation, consumer spending edged up 0.1%, consistent with a roughly 2.5% annualized growth rate this quarter. Spending rose at a 3.5% rate in the July-September quarter, accounting for the economy's 2.8% growth pace.\nThe Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 2.7% rate in the fourth quarter.\nSpending was largely driven by strong demand for services, including healthcare, housing and utilities, financial services and insurance, dining out and hotel stays as well as transportation and recreation. Services spending rose 0.5%.\nGoods outlays were unchanged as an increase in purchases of motor vehicles and parts was offset by lower receipts at service stations because of cheaper gasoline. There were also price-related declines in outlays of apparel, furniture and other long-lasting manufactured household equipment.\nLow layoffs, strong household balance sheets thanks to a stock market rally and high home prices after underpinning spending. Household savings also remain lofty. The saving rate increased to 4.4% from 4.1% in September.\nIncome rose 0.6%, boosted by a 0.5% gain in wages. After accounting for inflation and taxes, income at the disposal of households rose 0.4% after edging up 0.1% in September.\nEconomists anticipate a fairly busy holiday shopping season, though high prices are squeezing budgets. Data from Adobe Analytics showed consumers have in the first 24 days of November spent $77.4 billion online, up 9.6% on a year-over-year basis. The Mastercard Economics Institute described this holiday shopping season as being characterized by \"the value-conscious consumer who feels stretched by economic pressures,\" and \"a confident consumer who feels more free to spend.\"\nStocks on Wall Street traded lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.\nLOW LAYOFFS\nThough inflation is cooling, the trend has slowed. The personal consumption expenditures price index climbed 0.2% in October, matching September's unrevised gain. In the 12 months through October, the PCE price index increased 2.3% after advancing 2.1% in September.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.3%, matching the increase in September. The so-called core inflation was lifted by services, mainly housing and utilities, transportation, as well as financial services and insurance. Goods prices fell. Core inflation increased 2.8% year-on-year in October after climbing 2.7% in September. The central bank tracks the PCE price measures for monetary policy.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he would impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, on his first day in office. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimated the tariffs, if implemented, would increase core PCE inflation by 0.9%.\n\"Disinflation through the import channel on goods has driven down inflation over the past two years,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \"But higher goods costs are most likely on the way, and that increase will also result in higher service-sector costs.\"\nIn the near-term, however, labor market slack could outweigh concerns about higher inflation readings.\nA separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 23, the lowest level since April.\nClaims have reversed the surge in early October, which was the result of hurricanes and strikes at Boeing and another aerospace company. Despite expectations for a rebound in nonfarm payrolls, the unemployment rate is likely to be unchanged or even rise this month.\nThe number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.907 million during the week ending Nov. 16, the highest level since November 2021, the claims report showed.\nThe so-called continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for November's unemployment rate. They increased between the October and November survey periods, indicating that many laid-off workers are finding it difficult to land new jobs.\nThe jobless rate has held steady at 4.1% for two straight months. The employment report for November would be crucial for the Fed's rate decision next month. Financial markets expect a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed's Dec. 17-18 policy meeting.\nThe central bank reduced rates by 25 basis points earlier this month, lowering its benchmark overnight interest rate to the 4.50%-4.75% range. It initiated its policy easing cycle in September, which marked its first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020, after hiking rates by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation.\nWhile consumers continued to steer the economy, business spending on equipment appeared to soften.\nA third report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showed non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.2% in October after a 0.3% gain in September.\n\"We see little growth in investment this quarter, with the possibility that spending could decline outright,\" said Abiel Reinhart, an economist at J.P. Morgan.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Paul Simao and Alistair Bell)"

        "article_content": "Investors this year have grown increasingly confident the US economy will achieve a \"soft landing.\"\nBut the election of Donald Trump as the nation's next president has complicated the outlook.\nAnd some economists now think it's likely the US could face another inflation resurgence if Trump follows through with his key campaign promises.\n\"We are in the soft landing,\" Nobel prize-winning economist and Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz said at Yahoo Finance's annual Invest conference on Tuesday. \"But that ends Jan. 20.\"\nTrump and his proposed policies have been viewed as potentially more inflationary due to the president-elect's campaign promises of high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigration. Those policies could also pressure an already bloated federal deficit, further complicating the Federal Reserve's path forward for interest rates.\n\"The biggest risk is a large across-the-board tariff, which would likely hit growth hard,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\nJennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics, also acknowledged in a note this week there are \"upside risks\" to inflation \"stemming partly from Trump’s proposed tariff and immigration policies.\"\nAnd investors have taken notice.\nOn Wednesday, the latest Global Fund Manager Survey from Bank of America highlighted increased expectations of a \"no landing\" scenario, in which the economy continues to grow but inflation pressures persist, leading to a higher-for-longer interest rate policy from the central bank.\nTariffs have been one of the most talked-about promises of Trump's campaign. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.\n\"It will be inflationary,\" Stiglitz said. \"And then you start thinking of the inflationary spiral. The prices go up. Workers will want more wages. And then you start thinking of what happens if others retaliate [with their own duties.]\"\nMinneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari categorized a possible retaliation as a \"tit-for-tat\" trade war, which would keep inflation elevated over the long term.\n\"If inflation goes up, [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell] is going to raise interest rates,\" Stiglitz said.\n\"You combine the higher interest rates and the retaliation from other countries, you're going to get a global slowdown. Then you have the worst of all possible worlds: inflation and stagnation, or slow growth.\"\nInvestors have dialed back rate cut expectations in preparation. Since the Fed's first rate cut on Sept. 18, markets now expect three fewer rate cuts between now and the end of next year, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.\nBut the US economy has remained resilient in the face of high interest rates. Retail sales once again topped estimates for the month of October, GDP remains strong, the unemployment rate continues to hover at around 4%, and inflation has moderated despite its bumpy path down to 2%. \nAdditionally, it remains unclear which policies will be a priority once Trump takes office or if he'll fully commit to the promises he's already made.\nThe only certainty is change.\nIn 2025, the GOP has not only secured the White House but also maintained control of the House of Representatives and flipped the Senate.\n\"The Republican sweep in the elections is likely to bring sweeping policy changes,\" Bank of America's US economics team wrote in a client note on Friday.\n\"There are plausible scenarios in which growth could run above 3%, or the economy could enter a recession,\" the team said. \"Our base case is sanguine, but our conviction is low. As the policy agenda becomes clearer next year, we will be nimble in adjusting our forecasts as needed.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke both indicated in separate remarks Thursday that they thought the US would likely avoid a recession.\n“For a long time, I always believed that there was a path to the soft landing, that it was possible to bring inflation down while maintaining a strong labor market. And to me, that's what the data suggests has happened,” Yellen told CNBC in an interview.\nThe Fed, Bernanke said during an appearance at a virtual event hosted by Fidelity Investments, has built \"a soft landing scenario, which is kind of the best of all possible worlds with jobs back to normal, inflation back to normal, interest rates back to normal.”\nBut Bernanke also warned of the risk that unemployment doesn't stabilize where it is and begins to go higher.\n\"That would happen if the economy began to slow, which we have not seen yet,” he said. \"But certainly it is a possibility if people begin to lose confidence or depending perhaps even on policies of the new administration.\"\nIn such a case, the Fed would \"have to respond,” he added.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nYellen underscored that the job market has cooled as the unemployment rate has drifted up, though it is still low by historical standards, and that inflation has come down considerably.\nShe noted the “last mile” on inflation is slower, with a lag in housing prices coming down. She thinks housing costs will fall further as market rents have come down.\n“Hopefully, this is going to turn out to be a stable situation with the Fed supporting continued strength in the labor market and inflation has come down considerably,” Yellen said.\nYellen and Bernanke are the two figures who preceded Jerome Powell as Fed chair, with Yellen serving in that role from 2014 to 2018 and Bernanke from 2006 to 2014. Yellen became Treasury Secretary in 2021.\nTheir comments come as fresh data on economic growth showed the latest second quarter gross domestic product estimate was 3% annualized growth in the US economy.\nThis third estimate confirmed that economic growth in the second quarter was higher than the 1.4% growth in the first quarter.\nMeanwhile, jobless claims data for the week ending Sept. 21 signaled a decline in the number of people filing for unemployment benefits. The Department of Labor saw 218,000 unemployment claims filed, coming in below Wall Street's expected 223,000. This marks the lowest level since mid-May.\nThe Fed decided last week to cut rates by 50 basis points, its first easing since 2020.\nBernanke said he thinks the Fed could cut by 50 to 75 basis points more this year, implying that the central bank could cut by a larger 50 basis points in one of the remaining meetings of the year.\nThe median projection among existing Fed officials is for two more cuts of 25 basis points each.\nHe sees another 100 basis points of rate cuts next year, in line with officials’ median projection. He said that that would bring the Fed to around 3%+ on the fed funds rate, and that would be close to where the Fed seems to believe neutral is — the level on the benchmark policy rate that neither spurs nor slows economic growth.\n“That’s, in some sense, the target,” said Bernanke. “Now, whether they'll get there or whether they'll be derailed by new information, new shocks, remains to be seen. But that's where they hope to end up, I think, as this process continues.”\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Fresh data out Thursday showed the US economy remains on track to grow at a solid pace through the end of 2024.\nS&P Global's flash US composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, came in at 54.4 in September, down from 54.6 in August. Economists had expected the index to tick down to 54.3.\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the data shows the US economy's growth is chugging along to start the fourth quarter.\n“October saw business activity continue to grow at an encouragingly solid pace, sustaining the economic upturn that has been recorded in the year to date into the fourth quarter,\" Williamson said in the release. \"The October flash PMI is consistent with GDP growing at an annualized rate of around 2.5%.\"\nWilliamson added that sales are being stimulated by \"competitive pricing,\" which led the selling price inflation for goods and services down to the lowest level since May 2020.\n\"These weaker price pressures are consistent with inflation running below the Fed’s 2% target,\" Williamson said.\nThis upbeat outlook falls in line with the strong projections market participants currently have for the third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) print. After a strong September jobs report and several better-than-expected retail sales prints, the economics team at Goldman Sachs is currently projecting the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.1% in the third quarter.\nMeanwhile, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model projects the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.4% in the third quarter.\nThe above-expected growth projections have helped quell recession fears that percolated in early August after the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.3%, triggering a commonly followed recession indicator.\n\"Our probability of recession models showed marked improvement in September, reversing much of the recent rise,\" Oxford Economics senior US economist Matthew Martin wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \"Against this backdrop, our conviction in our above-consensus GDP growth forecast for 2025 increased.\"\nOverall, the economic growth data over the past month hasn't swayed markets on what the Fed will do in November, with traders currently pricing in a 95% chance the central bank lowers interest rates by 25 basis points at its next meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\nHowever, markets have moved to price in fewer Fed rate cuts over the next year. Markets see the Fed likely making one fewer cut than was priced in on Oct. 4 and two fewer cuts than markets were projecting on Sept. 18, the day the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point.\nThis has coincided with an increase in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which has added about 50 basis points over the past month to hover near 4.2%. In some instances, a push higher in yields can be a headwind for stocks. But equity strategists have argued that if the increase in yields comes alongside solid economic growth, it will likely be a welcome sign for stocks.\n\"A gradual move higher [in yields] ... for the right reasons, with the expectation of higher growth, historically has tended to be good for those earnings growers,\" Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock Americas chief investment and portfolio strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"So keeping quality at the core of your portfolio remains really important.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-11-27T13:39:16.000Z",
        "article_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The American economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual pace from July through September on strong consumer spending and a surge in exports, the government said Wednesday, leaving unchanged its initial estimate of third-quarter growth.\nU.S. gross domestic product — the economy's output of goods and services — slowed from the April-July rate of 3%, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.\nBut the GDP report still showed that the American economy — the world's largest — is proving surprisingly durable. Growth has topped 2% for eight of the last nine quarters.\nWithin the GDP data, a category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a solid 3.2% annual rate from July through September, up from 2.7% in the April-June quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.\nStill, American voters — exasperated by high prices — were unimpressed by the steady growth and chose this month to return Donald Trump to the White House to overhaul the nation's economic policies. He will be supported by Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.5% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period and fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2023. Exports also contributed to the third quarter’s growth, increasing at a 7.5% rate, most in two years. Still, the third-quarter growth in both consumer spending and exports was lower than the Commerce Department initially estimated.\nBut growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. By contrast, spending on equipment surged.\nWhen he takes office next month, President-elect Trump will inherit an economy that looks broadly healthy.\nGrowth is steady. Unemployment is low at 4.1%. Inflation, which hit a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022, has fallen to 2.6%. That is still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, but the central bank felt satisfied enough with the progress against inflation to cut its benchmark interest rate in September and again this month. Most Wall Street traders expect the Fed to cut rates again in December.\nWednesday’s report also contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.1%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter.\nThe public still feels inflation's sting: Prices are about 20% higher than they were in February 2021, just before inflation started picking up\nTrump has promised an economic shakeup. On Monday, for example, he vowed to slap new import taxes on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Mainstream economists view such taxes — or tariffs — as inflationary. That is because they are paid by U.S. importers, who then seek to pass along the higher costs to their customers.\nWednesday's report was the second of three looks at third-quarter GDP. The Commerce Department will issue the final report on Dec. 19.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that consumer spending rose at the fastest pace since the fourth quarter, not the first quarter, of 2023."

But it's been swapped with a different bullish sentiment, one we all know very well: the strength of a hot economy, which has helped power the market all year — until that cut.\nWhile inflation and economic reacceleration concerns have returned after a string of hot data (the September jobs report, the Consumer Price Index, hot retail sales, and calmer weekly jobless claims), the strength has done nothing if not buoy the market. It has done just fine (thank you very much) under the past few years of high interest rates and endless no-landing comments. A hot economy is good for stocks.\nAll this has kept the S&P 500 floating around its all-time high all week, now well over 5,800, as the index passes more and more year-end forecasts — and their subsequent upward revisions, like UBS's 5,850 figure that it published Tuesday.\nThe mood feels different than a month ago. But as our Chart of the Week shows, not a whole lot has actually changed in terms of expectations — especially to the downside.\nThe latest Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey shows the soft landing potential may have slightly decreased. But the hard landing respondents faded just as much, falling into the single digits for the first time since June, with just 8% seeing a recession in the next 12 months.\nChecking in with the CME's FedWatch tool also shows little change. The belief that the Fed will continue to cut interest rates in November is still overwhelming, with the tool showing a 91% chance of a 25 basis point cut on Friday.\nReconciling these two things — another potentially reaccelerating economy and a rate cut the market is almost certain of — sounds tough. But it's not when you remember how high rates still are, as we wrote earlier this week in Chart of the Day. As Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said this week, rates are still \"overall restrictive.\"\nJason Furman, the former Council of Economic Advisers Chairman under President Barack Obama, told Yahoo Finance that he sees inflation as a bigger problem than recession right now. But the current Harvard professor mused that while \"the Fed needs to have tight policy, it just doesn't need to have policy being as tight as it was last year.\"\nHigh — but lower than they were — for longer.\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

The Fed, he said, does not need to see further cooling in the job market to achieve 2% inflation.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nWith inflation seemingly on track, Powell and many of his colleagues are now fully focused on the job market.\nWhile the central bank chair acknowledged the job market has cooled, Powell characterized it as “solid” and noted that layoffs are low, the unemployment rate is within a range of what’s considered full employment, and the labor force participation rate of individuals aged 25 to 54 — so-called prime-age workers — is near a historic high.\nIf the jobs report due out Friday shows more weakening, that could cause the central bank to consider cutting rates more deeply at the next meeting in November.\n\"Overall, the economy is in solid shape; we intend to use our tools to keep it there,\" Powell said Monday.\nIf the economy unfolds as expected, the Fed will cut interest rates \"over time toward a more neutral stance.\"\nAtlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic told Reuters on Monday he would be open to another 50 basis point rate cut at the Fed’s meeting in November if upcoming data show job growth slowing faster than expected.\nBostic said he previously penciled in just one more 25 basis point rate cut this year.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Republicans are suddenly warming to the US economy. Democrats have become gloomy. The economy itself hasn’t changed much in recent weeks, but something else has: There was a presidential election.\nDonald Trump’s narrow win in the 2024 presidential race highlights an oddity of modern economics: Confidence in the economy is partisan. Democrats and Republicans each feel better about the economy when their party is in control of the government and worse when the other party is running things. For some Americans, the actual state of the economy matters less than who’s in charge of it.\nThis dichotomy shows up neatly in the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment data. The sentiment index for Republicans jumped from 53.6 in October to 69.1 in November, putting it at the highest level since shortly after President Joe Biden took office in 2021.\nAmong Democrats, sentiment dropped from 91.4 in October to 81.3 in November. That’s the lowest level for Democrats in 18 months. Democrats are still more optimistic than Republicans, but a large gap grew much narrower immediately after the election.\nThe flip was even more stark when respondents gave their outlook for future economic conditions. The index for future expectation soared from 61.4 to 89.2 among Republicans, while it tumbled from 93.1 to 75.4 among Democrats. Republicans are now more optimistic about future conditions than Democrats for the first time since October of 2020.\nIndependents are more sober-minded and stable. They’re less optimistic than partisans on either side on both current sentiment and the future outlook. Both readings fell slightly for Independents from October to November, which may better reflect what’s happening in the real economy, rather than the political one.\nSimilar patterns held around the presidential elections in 2012, 2016, and 2020, with backers of the winning party suddenly becoming more optimistic and those affiliated with the losers more dreary. The Michigan pollsters used to ask about party affiliation only sporadically, but they made it a routine monthly question after the 2016 election.\nSo how is the economy actually doing? Meh, according to most Americans. Accounting for all political persuasions, the Michigan index ticked upward in November, but it remains depressed, well below 2021 levels before a bout of inflation kicked in, and even further below pre-COVID levels of 2019. Inflation factors heavily into the Michigan methodology, and inflation still nettles Americans bearing the higher cost of rent and groceries.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nOther indicators are stronger. The Consumer Board Confidence Index is slightly more buoyant than the Michigan one. Job growth is strong, and GDP growth is decent. Inflation, which peaked at 9% in 2022, is getting back to normal. Goldman Sachs puts the odds of a recession during the next year at a meager 15% (and it’s the same for both Republicans and Democrats).\nBut Trump himself is a wild card in the future outlook for the economy. His plans to slap new tariffs on imports and deport millions of migrants doing low-income work could nick economic growth and push inflation higher than it would otherwise be. Trump still hasn’t revealed how aggressively he’ll pursue either of those goals, but markets are bracing for a modest impact.\nLong-term interest rates have been rising, for example, in anticipation of higher inflation under Trump and tighter monetary policy to combat it. Democrats might feel sure that a Trump crash is coming. Republicans see smooth sailing ahead.

        "article_content": "The US labor market added far more jobs than projected in September while the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked lower, reflecting a stronger picture of the jobs market than Wall Street had expected.\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the labor market added 254,000 payrolls in September, more additions than the 150,000 expected by economists.\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, from 4.2% in August. September job additions came in higher than the revised 159,000 added in August. Revisions to both the July and August report showed the US economy added 72,000 more jobs during those two months than previously reported.\nWage growth, an important measure for gauging inflation pressures, rose to 4% year over year, from a 3.9% annual gain in August. On a monthly basis, wages increased 0.4%, in line with August's reading.\nThe key question entering Friday's report was whether the data would reflect significant cooling in the labor market, which could prompt another large Fed interest rate cut. Robert Sockin, Citi senior global economist, told Yahoo Finance that the better-than-expected jobs report makes it less likely the Fed moves with the \"urgency\" it did at its September meeting when the central bank cut interest rates by half a percentage point.\n\"This pushes the Fed out a lot,\" he said, adding that it's uncertain the Fed will make a 50 basis point cut again this year.\nRead more: Jobs, inflation, and the Fed: How they're all related\nFollowing the report, markets were pricing in a roughly 5% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by half a percentage point in November, down from a 53% chance seen a week ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool. \n\"Looking at the labour market strength evident in September’s employment report, the real debate at the Fed should be about whether to loosen monetary policy at all,\" Capital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"Any hopes of a [50 basis point] cut are long gone.\"\nFutures tied to major US stock indexes rallied on the news. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) put on nearly 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) added roughly 0.5%. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) moved 1.1% higher.\nRenaissance Macro head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note following the release that September's jobs report was \"undeniably good news\" for the equity market.\n\"At the end of the day, the Fed is still cutting policy rates even as the economy grows,\" Dutta wrote.\nAlso in Friday’s report, the labor force participation was flat from the month prior at 62.7%. Food services and drinking places led the job gains, rising 69,000 in the month. Meanwhile, healthcare added 45,000 jobs, and government jobs ticked higher by 31,000.\nEarlier this week, data from ADP showed the private sector added 143,000 jobs in September, above economists' estimates for 125,000 and significantly higher than the 99,000 seen in August. This marked the end of a five-month decline in private-sector job additions.\n\"This is a pretty healthy, widespread rebound,\" ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said. \"And probably unexpected by many people who thought the job market was on a downward slide. This month, of course, gives pause to those kinds of assessments. Hiring is still solid.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Kamala Harris is running for president on two economic platforms. The first is the record of the Biden-Harris administration. The second is her own set of prescriptions for fixing what voters don’t like about the Biden-Harris record.\nIt might just work. The vice president enjoys lucky timing, given that the biggest economic woe of the Biden years—inflation—is getting back to normal just as crucial undecided voters are making up their minds. And Harris’s own plans are clearly meant to plug the holes where voters think Biden failed.\nOn paper, the economy seems headed for the “soft landing” economists have been hoping for. Inflation continues to moderate, with the July inflation rate coming in at 2.9%, the lowest since March 2021. Inflation has dropped sharply from the peak of 9% in June 2022, suggesting the Federal Reserve’s sharp interest rate hikes have worked as intended to curtail rising prices. Investors now think it’s nearly certain the Fed will start slowly cutting interest rates in September, giving borrowers a much-needed break.\nConsumer spending is holding up. Retail sales in July were much stronger than economists expected, led by robust car sales. The latest data basically erases worries that popped up after a spotty jobs report for July showed signs of weakness. A mini market panic followed in early August. But that sell-off has completely reversed, with stocks up for the month, as investors decide maybe everything is fine after all.\nHere's a roundup of recent insights from leading forecasters:\nConference Board, Aug. 16: “Welcome to the soft landing.”\nCapital Economics, Aug. 16: “The data released this week was all consistent with a soft landing.”\nGoldman Sachs, Aug. 14: “We expect a modest growth pickup in [the second half] reflecting consumer spending growth, easing financial conditions, and rebound in inventory investment.”\nNeedless to say, all of this is not enough. Consumers remain gloomy, miffed about rents and food prices that are still elevated, high interest rates that make big purchases unaffordable, and chronic burdens such as costly child and medical care. This is where Harris now offers a reboot, promising to fix what Biden apparently couldn’t.\nHarris’s economic plan would tackle housing affordability with a new $25,000 tax credit for first-time buyers and incentives to add 3 million new homes to the national supply. She’d give Americans a break on medical debt and back a $6,000 tax credit for families with newborns. She also wants the government to ban “price gouging” on groceries and go after food conglomerates that supposedly extort shoppers.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nBiden backed similar policies, but got no love from voters for ongoing efforts to bring prices down. The biggest moves require congressional legislation, which Biden can’t get since opposition Republicans control the House of Representatives. Harris would face the same problem, unless she won with Democrats in full control of Congress, which is a slim possibility. So Harris may be no more able than Biden to address cost imbalances that still nag voters.\nYet Harris seems to be getting a sort of grace period Biden didn’t. In one eye-opening poll, voters ranked her higher than both Biden and her Republican opponent Donald Trump on her handling of the economy, even though Harris has no record at all on the national economy, except for Biden’s. Respondents in that poll indicated that they trust Harris more than Biden because they'd expect her to pursue different policies than Biden if she won the presidency.\nSo Harris now has to convince voters that she’s Not Joe Biden. The reality is that she’ll probably turn out to be quite similar to Biden on big issues involving taxes, healthcare, energy, and regulation. But that’s not the way to win in 2024.\nWhile Biden was still campaigning, he routinely bragged about everything going right in the economy: strong job growth, declining inflation, buoyant spending, a rising stock market. His low approval ratings reveal that voters gave him no credit for it. Yet that solid economic underpinning now allows Kamala Harris to precision-target the economic irritants Biden couldn’t quite extinguish. It’s not a bad one-two punch.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-09-24T16:17:30.000Z",
        "article_content": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon once again cited global instability as his chief concern and named it as one of the reasons why inflation may not yet be under control, saying that “geopolitics is getting worse.\"\n“My caution is all geopolitics, which may determine the state of the economy,” Dimon said in an interview with CNBC TV18 while attending a JPMorgan conference in Mumbai, India.\nGeopolitics are \"getting worse, they are not getting better,\" he added, pointing to recent attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. \"There's chance for accidents in the energy supply chain. God knows if other countries get involved. You have a lot of war taking place right now.\"\nThe comments marked the third time in the last week that the boss of the biggest US bank offered new skepticism about the economy's long-term path despite a new rate cut from the Federal Reserve designed to cushion a cooling labor market as inflation falls back.\nOn Friday, Dimon poured more cold water on the notion that the US central bank is likely to achieve a soft landing for the economy.\n“I wouldn’t count my eggs” on the outcome, he said at the Atlantic Festival in Washington, D.C.\nLast Tuesday, when asked at a Georgetown University event what concerned him from a financial markets perspective, he said that \"the most important thing that dwarfs all other things, that's really important, far more important today than [its] been probably since 1945, is this war in Ukraine, what's going on in Israel [and] in the Middle East, America's relations with China, and the attack fundamentally on the rule of law that was set up after World War II.\"\nDimon has been warning for some time that the US economy could be more vulnerable than some market observers think, having voiced concerns about a potential stagflationary environment where inflation remains elevated and some rates surge to 7% as the labor market weakens.\n\"I am not sure if the world is prepared for 7%,\" he said at an event in India a year ago.\nAs recently as August, he said he was still \"a little bit skeptical\" that the inflation rate would fall back to the Fed’s 2% target. He also said then that the odds of a recession still happening were better than the chance of no recession.\nRead more: The Fed rate cut: What it means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nLast Tuesday, Dimon acknowledged the need for the Fed to begin lowering interest rates but played down the importance of the central bank’s first move, calling it “a minor thing.”\nThe coming rate cuts, however, will have an effect on the bank.\nThat was made clear earlier this month when JPMorgan COO Daniel Pinto warned that the consensus view among analysts for the bank to earn net interest income of $91.5 billion in 2025 was \"not very reasonable\" due partly to the effect of falling rates.\nWhile admitting the bank’s financial projections for next year weren't complete, Pinto said JPMorgan was guiding for expenses to run higher in light of inflation and some other investments, while its biggest profit driver, net interest income, looked to be lower due to falling rates.\nNet interest income measures the difference between what banks earn on their assets (loans and securities) and what they pay out on their deposits.\nJPMorgan's stock fell the most intraday since 2020 following Pinto's comments.\nOn Tuesday in India, Dimon argued that he’s an optimist in the long term, but in the “short run, I’m a little more skeptical than other people that everything is going to be great.”\nHe warned about inflation's longer-term path even beyond the eruption of more conflict along with existing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nHe cited shifting demographics, world trade, and remilitarization, as well as the green economy transition and medium-term implications of artificial intelligence as potential contributors.\nHe also offered some skepticism about the lagging effects of US economic data releases that have become so pivotal for traders' expectations of the Fed's next move on interest rates.\n“Underneath the rate, there's a real economy. No one knows what that real economy is going to do next year. No one,” he said Tuesday.\n“Hopefully, we'll continue to exhibit growth with inflation coming down. I'm a little more skeptical about that, but it is happening,” he admitted.\n“Markets are pricing things like they're going to be great. Put me on the cautious side of that one,” he added.\nAs for politics, Dimon said he doesn't endorse either political candidate currently running for president, and he doesn't \"expect to be the Treasury secretary.\"\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "The US economy added more jobs than forecast in November while the unemployment rate ticked higher as the labor market rebounded from a month negatively impacted by severe weather and labor strikes.\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed 227,000 new jobs were created in November, just above the 220,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2%.\nHurricanes and a strike by Boeing (BA) workers weighed heavily on the October report, which was revised to show there were 36,000 jobs created last month. The unemployment rate stood at 4.1% in October.\nJob growth for September was also revised higher on Friday, with revisions now indicating the US economy added 56,000 more jobs than initially reported over those two months.\nRSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas told Yahoo Finance that Friday's report reflects a \"remarkably calm labor market\" that is at full employment after accounting for October's distortions.\nWage growth, an important measure for gauging inflation pressures, rose 0.4% in November, in line with October's increase and higher than the 0.3% rise economists had expected.\nCompared to the prior year, wages rose 4% in November, more than than 3.9% that had been forecast.\nMeanwhile, the labor force participation rate fell to 62.5% in November, down from 62.6% in October.\nIn its release, the BLS noted employment in the transportation equipment manufacturing industry rose by 32,000, \"reflecting the return of workers who were on strike.\" Temporary help services employment rose modestly in November but also marked a turnaround from a loss of over 33,000 jobs in this industry the prior month.\nThe report comes as investors look for clues on whether or not the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates for the third time this year at its Dec. 18 meeting.\nEntering the print, markets were widely expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in December. As of Friday morning, markets are pricing in a nearly 87% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, up from a 66% chance seen a week ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\nEconomists argue that the November jobs report should do little to change that thinking. \n\"For the Fed, these numbers are going to be right in the spot of what they were looking for and they're comfortable with to continue easing policy at least at the December meeting,\" Citi senior global economist Robert Sockin told Yahoo Finance. \"This doesn't change the narrative that likely rates are restrictive and they have to at least come down a bit more at a gradual pace.\"\nSockin added that while the increase in the unemployment rate could be seen as an early sign of concern that the labor market is weakening, the metric remaining in the low 4% range for the past several months is \"sort of the definition of a soft landing.\"\n\"When you look over the last several reports, [the Fed will] be fairly comfortable that they're still getting that soft landing,\" Sockin said. \"But there are enough risks that I think they still need to lower rates.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Since the U.S. Federal Reserve started initiating consistent interest rate hikes in March 2022 to combat inflation, investors have been grappling with two key questions: Will these measures effectively stabilize prices, and when might the Fed shift its strategy?\nRecent developments provide clarity. At the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell remarked that “inflation has declined significantly” and indicated a change in course.\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n“The time has come for policy to adjust,” Powell announced. “The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.”\nFrom March 2022 through July 2023, the federal funds target rate range escalated from a mere 0% to 0.25% to a substantial 5.25% to 5.50%. While generally, lower interest rates could stimulate economic growth and buoy investors, skepticism remains.\nPeter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, expresses significant concerns regarding the Fed's forthcoming strategy shift. In a recent post on X, Schiff cautioned, “If you thought inflation was bad when the Fed claimed to be fighting it, wait until you see how much worse it gets now that the pretend fight is over.”\nHis concerns extend beyond inflation; Schiff also highlights looming risks for the U.S. dollar and the broader economy.\nSchiff looked at the U.S. dollar index, which measures the value of the greenback relative to a basket of foreign currencies, including the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.\nThe index was established in 1973 with a base value of 100, reached a high of 164 in 1985, and hit a low of around 70 in 2008.\nMost recently, the index fell following Powell’s remarks suggesting a policy shift.\nOn Aug. 23, Schiff noted, “The Dollar Index closed at 100.67. The index could easily sink below 90 before year-end, challenging the 2020 low.”\nThis forecasted depreciation in the dollar could have broad implications. A weaker dollar generally makes U.S. exports cheaper and more competitive abroad, potentially boosting U.S. manufacturing and export sectors. However, it also makes imports more expensive, which can contribute to domestic inflation by increasing the cost of foreign goods and services.\nLooking ahead, Schiff predicts this downward trend will persist into 2025, stating, “I think that low will be breached in 2025, triggering a U.S. dollar crisis, crashing the economy and sending consumer prices and long-term interest rates soaring.”\nSchiff didn’t provide further details in that post, but a rapid decline in the dollar’s value could undermine international confidence in the U.S. currency as a store of value and medium of exchange. The resulting economic turbulence might also impact the U.S. economy by making it more expensive to service dollar-denominated debt, particularly for foreign borrowers.\nRead more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year — but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)\nSchiff’s grim forecast for the U.S. dollar leads him to favor an alternative as a store of value: gold.\n“Gold rose today to close above $2,500 for the 2nd consecutive week,\" he noted in another post on Aug. 23. \"Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index sank to a 13-month low.”\nHe interprets this trend as evidence that the Federal Reserve's policy shift is ill-advised. “This clearly confirms the Fed's pivot is a mistake,” he argues.\nSchiff has consistently maintained that the battle against inflation is far from over. With the Fed’s pivot signal, his conviction only deepens, anticipating further increases in prices. He predicts a continuing inverse relationship between the value of the U.S. dollar and gold, stating, “Higher inflation and lower rates mean the dollar goes through the floor as gold goes through the roof.”\nTraditionally, gold is considered a safeguard against inflation, as it is a tangible asset not subject to the whims of monetary policy that can inflate the supply of fiat currency. The yellow metal has gained considerable investor attention recently, with its price soaring by 23% in 2024 compared to the year prior.\nSchiff isn’t just theorizing; he’s investing according to his beliefs. The latest 13F filing from Euro Pacific Asset Management reveals a significant emphasis on the precious metal within Schiff’s investment strategy.\nAs of July 30, the largest holding at Euro Pacific Asset Management was gold mining company Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM). Meanwhile, Euro Pacific’s second-largest holding was Barrick Gold (ABX), another heavyweight player in the gold mining business.\nFor those aligned with Schiff’s outlook and considering gold as an addition to their investment portfolio, options abound. Investors can purchase gold bullion, own shares of gold mining companies, invest in gold ETFs and even tap into potential tax advantages through a gold IRA.\nUnlock access to 4,700+ hand-picked, single-family homes across America — and the juicy rental cash they can generate.

        "date": "2024-10-06T12:30:45.000Z",
        "article_content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nI have never been a monthly jobs report guy.\nLet me explain.\nThe first Friday of each month, the government releases its non-farm payrolls report — as it did this past Friday, where we saw a surprisingly strong gain of 254,000. As soon as the report hits the newswires, we (media + investors) tear apart each line to get a sense of what's happening in the economy. These days the report is really used to try and predict the direction of Fed policy.\nAfter the initial reading frenzy, we aim to put context around it and see how it applies to the companies powering the stock market. By later in the afternoon, we shuffle along to the next market-moving story. If you are an investor, that probably means obsessing over Nvidia's (NVDA) daily price swings.\nBy Saturday, the jobs report is a distant memory. By Monday, it's ancient history.\nThe hoopla over a single data point has always seemed a bit much, especially since I've long wondered if it truly captures the real health of the economy. This thing is always revised up and down. (The prior two months were revised higher by 72,000 jobs!)\nIn recent years, I've rolled with the punches — reported on the numbers, asked execs about it, and tried to keep it in mind as I browse the grocery aisles.\nBut I still question its usefulness and accuracy, and so am forever looking for better insights into the economy.\nTo that end, here's the byproduct of that pursuit.\nThis week, I spent two days in Bentonville, Ark., meeting with the Walmart (WMT) team and walking stores. The final day concluded with an interview with its veteran CEO, Doug McMillon.\nI first interviewed Doug in 2017 when he was still early in his CEO tenure (he started in 2014). He appeared to be the same guy I initially met — deep thinker, fiercely competitive, and passionate about retail and Walmart's mission to save people money.\nWalmart may offer the best insight into the US economy, especially as its improved assortment and online marketplace is sucking in high-income shoppers and profit. Its stock is up more than 50% this year versus rival Target's (TGT) 4.3% gain.\nHere's my economic exchange with Doug:\nSozzi: How challenged is the average Walmart shopper?\nMcMillon: People at lower income levels are always more challenged. They have to make trade-off decisions, and that's been, I think, more acute since this inflationary cycle on the heels of the pandemic. So, a household income below $100,000 feels pressure in a way that they might not have a few years ago, and you can see that in their behavior. And we are trying to get prices down ... some of the more stubborn inflation has been in the prepared foods, dry grocery type, consumable categories, like paper goods, cleaning supplies.\nSozzi: Do you see prices coming down and beginning to ease?\nMcMillon: The rate of inflation is less. But after a couple of years of inflation in dry grocery and consumables, they're settling out at a higher level, and we at Walmart don't want to accept that. We want to keep finding ways to be more efficient to get them back down. And we're not seeing those categories come down in the short term.\n(I normally don't take pics with executives, but Doug's office is the original one used by Sam Walton, who I'm told used to keep a shotgun behind the door — he was a nature guy).\nAfter I got off the plane from Arkansas, I headed into the office to get ready for an Opening Bid podcast taping with my favorite chief economist Michelle Meyer from Mastercard Economics Institute (previously Bank of America). You can watch the full episode in the above video.\nMichelle has access to a wealth of data on the economy and consumer, notably how people are spending on their credit and debit cards (she's forecasting a very solid holiday shopping season).\nHere's an interesting economic takeaway from our chat:\nSozzi: Why is the labor market slowing?\nMeyer: Think about pre-pandemic. If we got 250,000 jobs [each month], it would be like, oh my God, that's a statistical error. Like, how did the Bureau of Labor Statistics report that? Because the belief prior to the pandemic — and that's given the data we had seen in the labor market — trend job growth was probably in the order of 100,000, give or take a few in either direction.\nSo we in a way had this period of volatility in the labor market when we went from the extreme amount of job dislocation when the pandemic hit to this massive rehiring and reengagement in the workforce. Now we have to settle into something that should be more sustainable and probably more moderate as well.\nThe jobs report is probably useful, but I hope this piece is a reminder that there are more ways to get a clearer sense of the economy. Find them, and prosper.\nLast week on this digital canvas, I recommended you go out and read three books on AI to become a more informed investor (and dare I say, human being). A reader subsequently asked me to shed light on the best books related to AI.\nSo, I tapped my vast network of sources in the AI industry for their suggestions. The interesting thing is I was told not many great books existed yet (somewhat worrisome?) on the technology, more so online technical white papers.\nHere are a few that will take you the weekend (if not longer) to get through:\nWhat Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work? by Stephen Wolfram\nWhat’s Really Going On in Machine Learning? Some Minimal Models by Stephen Wolfram\nSituational Awareness: The Decade Ahead by Leopold Aschenbrenner\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

The reading came in higher than first quarter GDP, which was revised down to 1.4%.\n“We think [the second quarter] will end up being the best quarter for the economy this year,” Nationwide financial markets economist Oren Klachkin wrote of this morning’s Q2 GDP report. “We should receive cooler GDP reports from here on out as consumers tighten their purse strings and businesses become more reticent to invest and hire.”\nMeanwhile, the \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, grew by 2.9% in the second quarter, above estimates of 2.7% but significantly lower than the 3.7% gain in the prior quarter.\nThe data's release comes as investors try to gauge when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates and if the central bank can achieve a soft landing, where inflation comes down to its 2% target without a significant economic downturn.\nEntering Thursday, markets had priced in a 100% chance the Fed would cut rates by the end of its September meeting.\n\"The data today will reinforce the notion that the Fed has the benefit of time,\" Renaissance Macro head of economic research Neil Dutta wrote in a note following Thursday's release. \"In the Fed’s mind, there is no need to rush with private domestic demand growing at a solid pace over the second quarter. July remains a set up meeting for September.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "The Russian economy looks unable to sustain President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine past next year, but an end to the fighting could also pose an existential threat to his regime, according to experts.\nIn an analysis in Foreign Policy magazine earlier this month, Marc R. DeVore, a senior lecturer at the University of St. Andrews’s School of International Relations, and Alexander Mertens, a professor of finance at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, explained how Russia can’t produce enough to replace what it’s losing on the battlefield.\nFor example, the military is losing about 320 tank and artillery cannon barrels a month, while Russian factories can produce only 20 each month, forcing the Kremlin to dig into aging Soviet stockpiles. But that’s not enough, and Russia will run out of barrels sometime in 2025, DeVore and Mertens estimated.\nIn addition, Russia is losing about 155 infantry fighting vehicles a month, but its defense industry can make only 17 a month. The supply-and-demand economics of artillery shells and troops are also unsustainable.\n“Russia cannot continue waging the current war beyond late 2025, when it will begin running out of key weapons systems,” they wrote.\nBut the Kremlin’s mobilization of the economy to support the war has also left it vulnerable to an eventual end to hostilities.\nDeVore and Mertens noted that paring back massive defense spending will trigger an economic downturn and leave many without work.\n“The experience of other societies—in particular, European states after World War I—suggests that hordes of demobilized soldiers and jobless defense workers are a recipe for political instability,” they warned.\nThe war has also distorted the composition of Russia’s economy, favoring defense firms at the expense of small- and medium-size firms that serve the civilian sector, which won’t be able to absorb soldiers and workers displaced by the war’s end.\nA peace deal would leave Putin with three unpalatable options, according to DeVore and Mertens. The first would be to shrink the military and defense industry, sparking a recession that threatens the regime. The second is to maintain a massive military that eventually chokes off economic growth.\n“Having experienced the Soviet Union’s decline and fall for similar economic reasons, Russian leaders will probably seek to avoid this fate,” they added.\nThe third option is to maintain the military and use it to seize the resources it needs—“in other words, using conquest and the threat thereof to pay for the military.” They pointed to offshore gas reserves in the Black Sea, other natural resources in Ukraine, or the withdrawal of Western sanctions as possibilities.\n“Russia’s supersized military sector incentivizes the Kremlin to use its military to extract rents from neighboring states,” DeVore and Mertens said. “The alternatives—demobilizing and incurring a recession or indefinitely funding a bloated military and defense industry—pose existential threats to Putin’s regime.”\nPeace, in some form, could come sooner rather than later as President-elect Donald Trump has signaled he is eager to find a way to stop the fighting.\nFor now, President Joe Biden is rushing to help Kyiv before Trump takes over. The White House recently allowed Ukraine to fire U.S.-made long-range missiles into Russian territory, after North Korea sent troops to help Putin.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 best gig economy stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the gig economy market, go directly to the 5 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy.\nThe gig economy refers to a labor market characterized by short-term, freelance, or independent contractor positions, where individuals are hired on a temporary or flexible basis to complete specific tasks or projects. Gig workers are independent contractors who typically find work through online platforms or apps that connect them with clients or customers who are looking for various kinds of services such as coding, writing, and graphic designing, among others.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was one of the main growth catalysts for gig workers and the number of these independent contractors is rising rapidly. According to a report by MBO Partners, 45% of the US American workforce worked as independent contractors in 2023. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of independent workers grew by 89%. The report states that 40% of the gig workers said that they used online platforms to find work over the last 12 months and 47% are planning to use them over the next 12 months.\nAccording to Business Research Insights, the global gig economy market was valued at $14.75 billion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% between 2023 and 2031, reaching $92.9 billion at the end of the forecasted period. A report by the gig economy company, Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK), posted in October 2023, revealed that Gen Z and millennials are the top earners in the gig economy with 45% of the former and 44% of the latter group making at least $2,500 a month from the platform. Moreover, as of 2022, North American and Western European citizens have the highest average freelance rates at $44 and $31 per hour, respectively. It is followed by South America at $24 per hour and Central America, Asia, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe are all tied at $22 per hour.\nOn February 16, MoffettNathanson’s senior research analyst, Michael Morton told CNBC that the last 12 months have been quite positive for the gig economy stocks. He said that initially, the industry was considered a weak domain by investors because it consumed $125 billion of investor capital between 2015 and 2022 while being focused on expanding market share rather than increasing profitability. However, over the last year, companies like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) have experienced a “profitability explosion” due to their corporate decisions. Morton added that according to his firm, the total addressable market for the gig economy industry is around $4 trillion. He noted that grocery delivery is a trillion-dollar market that is “underpenetrated”, and there is a chance that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) could also capture a noteworthy share of this market very soon.\nMicheal Morton mentioned that he has heard people refer to Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc.

(NYSE:UBER) posted its FY23 earnings on February 7, reporting that its gross bookings were up 19% year-over-over, and it generated a revenue of $37.28 billion, up 17% year-over-year.

(NYSE:UBER) seems to have a promising future, it faced several headwinds in the first quarter of 2024 due to which its earnings and revenues declined slightly. It reported its Q1 earnings on May 8 with a loss per share of $0.32. Nevertheless, the company’s revenue was up 15%  year-over-year at $10.1 billion, and income from operations was $172 million, up $434 million from Q1 2023. The company reached an adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% year-over-year, marking a new quarterly record for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). The company also generated a free cash flow of $4.2 billion over the trailing twelve months. The company’s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, made the following remarks:\nOn February 15, DoorDash, Inc.

The company generated a revenue of $8.6 billion in 2023, compared to $6.58 billion in 2022. It announced its first quarter 2024 earnings on May 1, reporting an EPS of -$0.06.

At DoorDash, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:DASH) Q1 earnings call, the CEO Ravi Inukonda said:\nAs mentioned by Michael Morton, the gig economy industry is expected to grow significantly in the future with a $4 trillion total addressable market, and companies are rushing to capture a major chunk of it.

        "date": "2024-09-17T16:37:48.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose in August as a decline in receipts at auto dealerships was more than offset by strength in online purchases, suggesting that the economy remained on solid footing through much of the third quarter.\nThe report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed retail sales were a bit stronger than initially thought in July. It combined with the decline in the unemployment rate last month to push against financial market expectations for a half-percentage-point interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. U.S. central bank officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.\nThe Atlanta Fed raised its third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 3.0% annualized rate from a 2.5% pace after the data. The economy grew at a 3.0% pace in the second quarter.\n\"There does not appear to be any reason for Fed officials to start out with a larger 50 basis points rate cut because whatever stress there is in the labor market, it isn't translating into weaker economic demand,\" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. \"If this is an economy on the brink of recession, consumers certainly don't see it.\"\nRetail sales increased 0.1% last month after an upwardly revised 1.1% surge in July, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, falling 0.2% after a previously reported 1.0% jump in July. Estimates ranged from a 0.6% decline to a 0.6% gain.\nRetail sales increased 2.1% on a year-on-year basis in August. Online store sales rebounded 1.4% after falling 0.4% in July. Sales at gasoline stations dropped 1.2%, reflecting lower prices at the pump. Cheaper gasoline is likely freeing money for other spending.\nSales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores increased 0.3%. Building material and garden equipment store sales edged up 0.1%.\nSales at miscellaneous retailers shot up 1.7%, while those at health and personal care outlets increased 0.7%.\nBut sales at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, were unchanged after rising 0.2% in July. Economists view dining out as a key indicator of household finances.\nFurniture store sales fell 0.7%. Receipts at electronics and appliance outlets dropped 1.1%, while those at clothing retailers decreased 0.7%. Receipts at motor vehicle and parts dealers dipped 0.1% and department store sales tumbled 1.1%.\nSome of the decline in sales was likely due to lower prices rather than volume. Prices for goods, including furniture, have been on a downward trend.\nFinancial markets saw a roughly 59% probability of a 50 basis points rate cut on Wednesday, down from 67% before the retail sales data was published, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. The odds of a quarter-point rate reduction were around 41%, up from 33% earlier.\nStocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the benchmark S&P 500 briefly setting an intraday record high.\nThe dollar nudged up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.\nUNDERLYING STRENGTH\nThe Fed has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range for more than a year, having raised it by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023.\nMost economists expect the central bank to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, arguing that the economy is not in enough distress to warrant the half-percentage-point reduction being anticipated by financial markets.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 4.2% in August after four straight monthly increases lifted it to a near three-year high of 4.3% in July. The jobless rate has been largely driven by increased labor supply from immigration, which is now slowing.\nLayoffs remain low by historical standards, leaving the labor market in a position to continue generating steady wage gains that are supporting consumer spending and the overall economy. Subsiding inflation is lifting household's purchasing power. Economists are split on the implications that a declining saving rate could have on spending.\nSome view the saving rate, which dropped to 2.9% in July and is near levels last seen in 2008, as portending softer spending ahead. They also expect precautionary saving to rise if the labor market deteriorates, which could weigh on spending.\nOthers, however, argued that the government was not fully capturing income earned by undocumented immigrants. They also pointed to strong household balance sheets against the backdrop of higher house and stock prices as supportive of future consumer spending.\n\"For all the signs that low-income consumers are struggling, we think the risks of that weakness migrating up the income spectrum are low,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics. \"Middle- and higher-income households sit on considerable wealth gains since the pandemic, mainly reflecting the surge in housing equity.\"\nRetail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services increased 0.3% last month after rising by an upwardly revised 0.4% in July.\nThese so-called core retail sales were previously reported to have gained 0.3% in July. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists estimated that inflation adjusted core retail sales rose 0.1% in August, putting consumer spending on track to grow at an annualized rate of roughly 3.5% this quarter.\nThe raft of upbeat news on the economy was extended by other data on Tuesday showing a sharp rebound in manufacturing production last month, but a downward revision to July's output took off some of the shine.\nFactory output increased 0.9% last month amid a surge in motor vehicle production after a downwardly revised 0.7% drop in July, the Fed said in a second report. Economists had forecast factory output would rise 0.3% after a previously reported 0.3% decline in July.\nBusiness inventories also rose slightly above expectations in July, a potential boost in the calculation of GDP this quarter.\n\"Manufacturing is nowhere near as weak as would normally be the case if the U.S. economy were in recession,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci)"

        "article_content": "In this article, we will be finding the fastest-declining economy in the world in 2024. Based on the average annual GDP growth rates of the past 5 years, we’ve also prepared the free full list of 15 Fastest-Declining Economies in the World in 2024.\nThe global economy is experiencing critical economic challenges as growth is projected to slow to 2.6% in 2024 which is just above the recession threshold of 2.5%. This marks the third consecutive year of subpar growth compared to the pre-pandemic average of 3.2%. Speaking of recession, Japan has recently slipped into the recession 2024 list of countries.\nThe country has unexpectedly entered a recession after its GDP shrank for two consecutive quarters. In Q4 2023, the economy contracted by 0.4% year-over-year, following a 3.3% decline in the previous quarter. Consequently, Japan has lost its position as the world's third-largest economy to Germany, with Japan's GDP at about $4.2 trillion and Germany's at $4.4 trillion. Economists had anticipated a 1% growth for Japan in Q4. The yen's 9% depreciation against the dollar in 2023 contributed to this shift, despite boosting Japanese export-competitiveness.\nApart from Japan, the United Kingdom has also been in the limelight for fighting the recession. According to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, in terms of inflation, the UK currently boasts a lower rate compared to both the eurozone and the United States. However, despite this improvement, prices remain significantly higher than a year ago, with inflation measured at 2.3% in the UK, 3.4% in the US, and 2.4% in the eurozone.\nRegarding growth projections, the IMF forecasts that the UK economy will outpace several European counterparts over the next six years such as France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. The IMF predicts an 8.8% increase in the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 2029, compared to 8.3% for France, 5.7% for Germany, 3.5% for Italy, and 4.4% for Japan.\nHowever, despite the economic challenges globally, there are positive aspects in the global economic outlook. For instance, private consumption is expected to increase by approximately 4% which will outpace total income growth of 2.6%. This consumption boost, though primarily driven by borrowing, can stimulate economic activity. Additionally, some regions show promising growth rates; India, for example, is projected to grow by 6.5% in 2024, supported by strong public investment and a thriving service sector. According to the annual real GDP growth rates (as of April 2024), India is one of the top 10 fastest-growing economies in the world. Similarly, China is targeting around 5% growth by capitalizing on its strong manufacturing and trade sectors.\nAs far as economic trends in 2024 are concerned, inflation across OECD countries is anticipated to decline from 6.9% in 2023 to 5.0%, continuing to 3.4% in 2025. This decrease will be driven by stringent monetary policies and decreasing pressures on goods and energy prices. By the end of 2025, most major economies are expected to achieve central bank inflation targets. The United States is projected to experience GDP growth of 2.6% in 2024, which will slow to 1.8% in 2025 due to high borrowing costs and tempered domestic demand. Nevertheless, the US is known to have one of the best economies in the world in 2024. The euro area, on the other hand, will see a gradual rebound fueled by improved real household incomes, tight labor markets, and lower policy interest rates, with GDP growth forecasted at 0.7% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025.\nkirill_makarov/Shutterstock.com\nTo identify the fastest declining economies in the world in 2024, we averaged the annual GDP growth rates of 50 countries for the last 5 years i.e., from 2019 to 2023. The 15 countries with the lowest GDP growth rates were eventually selected. The data on GDP growth rate for each year (except 2022) was obtained from the International Motetary Fund’s database. The countries have been presented below in ascending order of average GDP growth rates.\nPlease note that for the year 2022, we relied on the GDP growth rates from the World Bank for all countries as IMF didn't have data for some countries for 2022.\nAverage GDP Growth: -9.96%\nOur methodology revealed that Lebanon is the fastest declining economy in the world in 2024 with an average GDP growth rate of -9.96% over the past five years. Several other fastest-declining economies have been discussed in depth below on our full free list of 15 Fastest Declining Economies in the World in 2024.\nIt is worth noting that Lebanon's economy has experienced a dramatic collapse, with its currency losing approximately 95% of its value since the crisis began in 2019. This devaluation has locked most depositors out of their savings and pushed over 80% of the population below the poverty line. The crisis is rooted in decades of excessive spending and corruption by the ruling elite, compounded by the banking sector's heavy lending to the state that has resulted in financial system losses above $70 billion.\nThe situation is further worsened by external pressures, such as the ongoing conflict with Israel and the war in Gaza, which have led to internal displacement and infrastructure damage. The IMF has indicated that while recent fiscal and monetary reforms have reduced inflation, they are insufficient for recovery. Bank deposits remain frozen, and the banking sector's paralysis continues even in 2024, making it the fastest-declining economy in the world today.\nTo check the free full list, please visit the 15 Fastest-Declining Economies in the World in 2024.\n If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The firm highlights the \"stickiness of inflation, especially in Europe,\" which could hinder real income growth and reduce the scope for policy easing.\nMoreover, political transitions in various countries are said to pose uncertainties, with potential risks around debt-funded stimulus and financial market reactions.\nThe firm believes the rise of isolationist trade policies and stronger pushback against immigration are also flagged as concerns, potentially leading to stagflationary effects in advanced markets.\nWhile some fear that recession is on the horizon for 2025, Capital Economics remains cautiously optimistic.\nThey note warning signs such as a downturn in manufacturing surveys, rising unemployment, and increasing loan delinquencies, but emphasize that these indicators alone don't guarantee a recession.\n\"Trends in credit, employment, retail sales, and construction still paint a broadly positive picture,\" said Capital Economics.\nOverall, they predict that a \"soft landing is the most likely outcome\" for 2025, though they are closely monitoring the evolving risks.\nRelated Articles\nWhat is the 2025 outlook for the global economy?\nYellen 'probably done' when Biden ends term, may meet Chinese counterpart soon\nThousands protest in France against Macron's choice of prime minister"

        "article_content": "The U.S. economy is in a pretty good place. The jobs market is robust, and panic around a looming recession is starting to die down. But something feels a bit off. Although things have been going relatively well, major layoffs just keep happening. Across industries, we’re seeing jobs slashed. Large companies that have recently announced layoffs include Tesla, Expedia, Sony and Nike, to name but a few.\nFind Out: 6 Industries That Won’t Exist by 2040Learn More: 7 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)\nIf the economy — specifically the labor market — is doing so well, why are all these layoffs happening?\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nSometimes companies go on ambitious hiring sprees, and then, not long after they jump the gun on bringing in tons of new talent, they realize they have to backpedal and cut down.\n“One of the principal reasons for the recent workforce reductions is to trim back the pace of robust hiring that had occurred, particularly by targeting less essential or core business areas to implement the type of cost-reduction and restructuring measures that can enhance profitability and impress stock analysts,” said Alan Kosan, senior vice president and the head of Alpha Research at Segal Marco Advisors.\nRead Next: How Much Household Income Will Be Considered Upper Middle Class in 5 Years?\nOne of the simplest and most fundamental reasons companies conduct layoffs is cutting costs. Frankly, employees are expensive, and with the pressures of inflation and the lingering impacts of the pandemic, covering their costs has become cumbersome for many companies.\n“While payroll expenses vary by industry, they are often one of, if not the highest expense a company pays out annually, ideally on average equating to 15% to 30% of gross revenue,” said Lauren Winans, CEO and principal HR consultant at Next Level Benefits. “With the last four years of unexpected and unusually high expenses due to the pandemic, inflation and legislative changes, many companies are forced into making drastic changes.”\nThere’s also additional ambiguity due to it being an election year, and companies are looking to make more strategic changes to position themselves well for 2024 and beyond.\nCompanies are looking to cut costs, eliminate staff redundancies, combat poor business performance and prepare for the unknown, and, unfortunately, the easiest way to improve the outcome of all those factors is to reduce big expenses like payroll.\nWinans pointed to a more strategic trend emerging among more companies across a variety of sectors: workforce planning.\n“Many industries haven’t had to heavily rely on the intricacies of strategically designing a workforce to meet business demands, but as technology advances and the costs for literally everything continue to increase, companies are realizing that they can no longer operate reactively,” Winans said. “Best-in-class strategic workforce planning involves a myriad of components, but focuses on the idea of identifying the right mix of staff to get the job done today while regularly evolving the workforce plan to respond to external factors.”\nWe are on the brink of yet another major evolution in the workforce, as AI continues to gain swift traction. And just as labor market experts and employees feared, AI is rapidly stealing jobs.\n“Technology is replacing many tasks, not the least of which is AI,” said Matt Willer, managing director of capital markets and partner at Phoenix Capital Group.\n“Finally, outsourcing trends frequently defer certain tasks to an outside vendor, overseas or domestically, making that expense line item variable rather than fixed,” Willer said.\nCompanies need to grasp that even if layoffs seem appropriate, or even necessary, these morale-slashing moves are damaging to their reputations. Laying off staff may only encourage members of younger generations — who have already been criticized for job-hopping — to be disloyal to their employers both in the present and in the future.\n“The downside to that is that people have long memories,” said Bill Catlette, managing partner at Contented Cow Partners. “We wonder today why Gen Zers don’t seem as invested in the employment relationship as their predecessors. Having watched how their forebears were put out like yesterday’s garbage, they are simply playing the cards they were dealt. My father had one job across a forty-year career. I’ve had seven. My grandchildren will likely have seven at one time.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $20 You Can Spend at Dollar Tree, According to Superfans\n10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\nThis is One of the Best Ways to Boost Your Retirement Savings in 2024\n7 Things You'll Be Happy You Downgraded in Retirement\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: If the Economy Is Doing So Great, Why Are There So Many Layoffs?"

        "article_content": "The American economy is historically strong. However, entrepreneur Jaspreet Singh says there’s a risk hiding in plain sight that nobody is talking about.\nSingh is host of the “The Minority Mindset Show” and operator of the popular Minority Mindset YouTube channel. A serial entrepreneur and licensed attorney, Singh uses his platform to spread financial education.\nRead More: Elon Musk Supports Abolishing The Fed: What That Could Mean for Your Wallet\nTry This: Why Skipping a Financial Advisor Could Be Your Biggest Money Mistake\nIn a recent YouTube video, Singh outlined the glaring risk that he said nobody is talking about.\nAlso see what the Fed rate cuts could mean for your money.\nTrending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nDespite strong economic indicators, the Federal Reserve has begun lowering interest rates. As Singh noted, this is unusual: “Normally, the Federal Reserve bank cuts interest rates as a way to stimulate the economy.”\nSingh highlighted the following interest rate cuts from recent history.\n2019-2020: Cut from 2.5% to 0%\n2007-2008: Cut from 5.25% to 0.25%\n2000-2001: Cut from 6.5% to 1%\nEach of these rate cuts was done in response to a major economic downturn. In 2020, it was the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2008, it was the Great Recession, and in 2001, the bursting of the dot-com bubble.\n“The margin that the Federal Reserve bank has had to cut interest rates has been getting slimmer and slimmer and slimmer,” Singh said. “And that means the Federal Reserve bank has to get more creative to stimulate the economy.”\nCheck Out: Here’s What the US Minimum Wage Was the Year You Were Born\nAccording to Singh, the Fed has signaled that it aims to further reduce interest rates over the next 18 months or so. While that’s good news for anyone thinking about buying a car or a house, Singh noted that it’s an unusual step that carries some risk should the economy go into recession.\n“We know that recessions happen,” Singh said. “We’ve seen a recession pretty much every decade for the last century … So the question is, if we’re cutting interest rates now, when we’re already in a strong economy, what’s going to happen if we enter a weak economy? How will the Federal Reserve bank stimulate then?”\nSingh speculated that there are several potential avenues the Fed could take, including money printing, negative interest rates and more stimulus in the form of quantitative easing.\nAccording to CMC Markets, quantitative easing in the process in which a central bank purchases government securities in order to stimulate the economy. Central banks usually look to other methods of stimulating the economy when interest rates are high; however, quantitative easing is an option when interest rates are already low.\nShould the Fed choose this path, Singh explained, there’s a hidden risk that nobody is talking about.\nIn the video, Singh used a broad hypothetical to describe the risks of using quantitative easing during a recession when interest rates are already low.\n“If the government wanted to spend money, the way that they do that is by going to Congress and saying ‘Hey, we want to build a $1 trillion infrastructure package, and in order to finance this, we need to create this tax,'” he said. However, Singh noted, that’s not what has been happening. Instead, we’ve been seeing the federal government spend money it doesn’t have.\nThis is what’s known as “the hidden tax.” This money has to come from somewhere, and according to Singh, the Federal Reserve prints the money and lends it to the U.S. government.\nSo who pays the price?\n“The answer is … everybody pays the price,” Singh said. “When you print money … there’s a cost to that. And that cost is inflation.”\nInflation measures the rising costs of goods and services. It’s normal for prices to increase by 2% to 3% per year, but when inflation increases faster than that, it puts a heavier burden on consumers. On the flip side, when inflation happens, you spend more money at businesses, which often delivers disproportionate benefits to investors.\n“The most expensive kind of money is, of course, free money because the person who pays the price is the person who doesn’t understand it,” Singh said. “So the average person ends up getting hurt even more.”\nWhen the economy is slow, the Federal Reserve often cuts its interest rates to stimulate borrowing and put more money into the economy. However, what happens if a recession hits when rates are already low?\nSingh said it’s likely that the Fed would print more money and invest more money in the economy in the form of quantitative easing. This has two hidden costs: inflation and an increased national debt, which may lead to tax increases later on.\nWe can’t control what the Fed does. Instead, Singh said you should pay down your credit card debt, set aside cash for an emergency fund and make sure you have some cash lying around to capitalize on any investment opportunities that arise.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Moves For Building Lasting Wealth: What Smart Americans Are Doing Right\nThe Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Retirees Should Make Before Inauguration Day\n3 Reasons Retired Boomers Shouldn't Give Their Kids a Living Inheritance\n5 Side Hustles That Can Earn You an Extra $1,000 Before 2025\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: A Risk in Today’s Economy That No One Is Talking About, According to Jaspreet Singh"

        "date": "2024-12-23T11:00:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump’s election provides a useful occasion to examine the difference between what rich people want and what constitutes a thriving economy.\nThe stock market, which is where rich people live, has been climbing since Election Day. On November 6, the day Trump was declared the winner, the Dow rose 3.6 percent; the S&P 500 scored its biggest gain in two years; and the world’s 10 richest people, nine of whom live in the United States, saw their wealth increase by a combined $63.5 billion. Over the month of November, the S&P 500 rose 5.7 percent. Stocks fell in December after the Fed signaled it would ratchet back rate cuts, but as of December 18, U.S. equities were still up 29 percent for the year.\nThe economy, on the other hand, is starting to falter. The Fed ratcheted back future rate cuts because Trump keeps threatening to slap tariffs on every conceivable import. On Friday, Trump boasted on Truth Social: “I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas. Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!” The United States is the largest exporter of oil to the EU already, and the European Commission previously floated the idea of buying more liquefied natural gas from the United States (because it’s cheaper than Russian LNG). So it’s quite possible Trump is merely trying to take credit for something that’s happening anyway. But if Trump aims to push the EU further, he could start a trade war.\nEverybody knows that Trump is all about reviving American manufacturing. But the National Association of Manufacturers, whose president, Jay Timmons, praised Trump in 2017 as “a true champion for our industry,” forecast in a postelection survey that in 2025 capital investment would grow only 1.6 percent. “That’s not particularly robust,” Timmons told Bloomberg’s Mark Niquette. In a December forecast, another manufacturing trade group, the Institute for Supply Management, predicted a more robust increase of 5.2 percent. But that’s compared to an increase of 5.6 percent this calendar year—when, Niquette pointed out, high interest rates inhibited investment.\nVanguard is an investment management firm and therefore part of the rich-people ecosystem, not the economy. But in addition to forecasting market trends it forecasts bona fide economic trends, and late last month it said gross domestic product growth, which has been 3 percent or higher under the supposedly ruinous economic policies of President Joe Biden, will fall to 2.7 percent next year under Trump. And that’s assuming Trump is mostly blowing smoke about tariffs and a mass roundup of immigrants. If he isn’t blowing smoke, says Vanguard, then GDP growth will be more like 2 percent.\nLike the Fed, Vanguard is worried that Trump’s trade policies will increase so-called “core” inflation, or inflation minus volatile food and energy costs. On Friday the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures index, which the Fed and Vanguard both prefer to the Labor Department’s consumer price index, showed core inflation to be 2.8 percent in November, same as it was in October. Trump promised in July that if voters elected him “inflation will vanish completely.” But Vanguard says that “inflation will remain above 2.5 percent for most of 2025.” Even Trump has stopped pretending he’ll conquer inflation, telling Eric Cortellessa in his Time “Person of the Year” interview, “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up.” \nIn that same July speech, Trump said, “Incomes will skyrocket.” But according to the website Trading Economics, which compiles statistics from official sources, nominal wage growth will fall from its October level of 5.6 percent (and a projected 5.4 percent for the final quarter of 2024) to 4.7 percent, 3.5 percent, and 2.5 percent during the respective first, second, and third quarters of 2025. If Vanguard is right that inflation won’t fall below 2.5 percent next year, then real wages will either stop growing next year or start falling. Under Biden, real median and real average wages have been rising for two and a half years. \nOf course, these are all predictions; we can’t know precisely what’s coming in 2025. But my own view is that these respectable calculations err on the side of optimism. The pros predict that the economy will fare somewhat worse. Freed of their imperative to give every benefit of the doubt, I believe the economy will tank. Your investments may appreciate in value, which is all the oligarchs really care about. But this time next year, I doubt your boss will promise you a raise for 2026. Instead, he may tell you to clean out your desk."

        "article_content": "By Michael S. Derby\n(Reuters) -U.S. consumers were bracing last month for higher levels of inflation in coming years even as they marked up expectations that their personal financial situations would improve markedly, the New York Federal Reserve reported on Monday.\nRespondents to the regional Fed bank's survey of consumer expectations in November see inflation a year from now at 3%, versus the 2.9% expected in October, while inflation in three years is seen at 2.6%, compared to 2.5% in the previous month. Inflation five years from now is expected to be 2.9%, compared to 2.8% in October.\nThe New York Fed noted educational levels affected the view on future inflation, saying \"the overall increase in one- and three-year-ahead inflation expectations masks a decline among those without a college degree and an increase among those with a college degree.\"\nThe projected rise in inflation contrasted with expectations that gasoline prices, rent and food costs will all rise at a weaker rate a year from now, even as the costs of medical care and college are seen mounting bigger gains. Meanwhile, the expected rise in home prices held steady at 3% in November.\nThe survey was released at a time of considerable expected change in the path of the economy tied to President-elect Donald Trump's imminent return to the White House. Trump is widely expected to pursue policies that increase price pressures through his promise of large tariffs on U.S. trading partners and deportations of immigrants. His tax and spending plans are also expected to push up deficits by a sizable amount.\nThe Fed is widely expected to cut its benchmark overnight interest by a quarter of a percentage point at its Dec. 17-18 policy meeting, with much less certainty about what comes after that, given the unpredictability of Trump's policy agenda and stickier-than-expected inflation pressures.\nThe New York Fed survey, which was conducted throughout November, found optimism over the future of the economy. Respondents projected better income and earnings growth, although their outlook on the job market softened a bit.\nWhile households' view of their current financial situation was stable and their sense of access to credit little changed, year-ahead expectations of those respondents who see a better financial situation jumped to the highest level since February 2020. Meanwhile, the share of those who expect to be worse off ebbed to the lowest level since March 2021. Households also put lower prospects on missing debt payments.\nAlthough economists expect Trump will drive deficits higher, respondents in the New York Fed survey cut their forecasts of the growth in government debt to the lowest reading since February 2020. Households also predicted a rising probability that interest rates on savings accounts will be higher in a year, which contrasts with an expected path of Fed policy that points to lower interest rates.\n(Reporting by Michael S.

The bank cut the rate by 20 bps on September 27.\nChina's consumer inflation unexpectedly eased in September, while producer price deflation deepened, heightening pressures on Beijing to take steps to spur demand as exports lose steam.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters estimate a 0.5% rise in China's consumer prices for this year, well below the government's target of around 3%, before picking up 1.4% in 2025.\n(For other stories from the Reuters global long-term economic outlook polls package:)\n(Polling by Susobhan Sarkar and Anant Chandak in Bengaluru and Jing Wang in Shanghai; Reporting by Kevin Yao; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)"

        "date": "2024-12-04T15:49:06.000Z",
        "article_content": "This story was originally published on CFO Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO Dive newsletter. \nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that a healthy job market and unexpected strength in the economy give policymakers time to mull the pace of future cuts to the benchmark interest rate.\n“The economy is strong and it's stronger than we thought it was going to be in September,” when the Fed began reducing borrowing costs from a two-decade high, Powell said. “The labor market is better, and the downside risks appear to be less in the labor market,” he said during a webcast hosted by The New York Times.\n“So the good news is that we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral,” Powell said, referring to a level in the federal funds rate that neither slows nor spurs economic growth.\nPowell’s comments align with those of other Fed officials in recent days who backed a cautious approach to future reductions in the federal funds rate. Since September the Federal Open Market Committee has trimmed borrowing costs by 0.75 percentage points to a range between 4.5% and 4.75%.\n“Recent data have raised the possibility that progress on inflation may be stalling at a level meaningfully above 2%,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Monday.\n“This risk has raised concerns that the FOMC should consider holding the policy rate constant at our upcoming meeting to collect more information about the future path of inflation and the economy,” Waller said in a speech. He said he is leaning toward voting for a quarter-point cut to the main interest rate at a Dec. 17-18 FOMC meeting.\nA measure of inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices and closely tracked by the Fed edged up to a 2.8% annual rate in October from 2.7% in September, persisting above the Fed’s 2% target. The core personal consumption expenditures price index in October increased 0.3%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Nov. 27.\nAnother gauge of price pressures, the consumer price index, rose at a 2.6% annual rate in October compared with 2.4% the prior month.\nShelter costs increased 0.4% during October, fueling more than half of overall price gains, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Nov. 13. The core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, gained 0.3% last month, the same pace as in August and September.\n“There are certainly upside risks to price stability,” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Monday. “Indeed, our Underlying Inflation Dashboard shows that many measures of inflation remain well above target.”\n“Uncertainties persist on various fronts and risks loom both for the health of the labor market and price stability,” he said.\n“Still, weighing the totality of the data, I do not view the recent bumpiness as a sign that progress toward price stability has completely stalled,” Bostic said in comments posted on the district bank’s website. “The path toward 2% inflation, while bumpy, looks sustainable.”\nAlthough policymakers have increasingly called for a prudent approach to easing, traders in interest rate futures raised the probability that the Fed will cut the federal funds rate by a quarter point at its next meeting to 76% from 67% on Nov. 27, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n“Based on the economic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its downward path to 2% over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting,” Waller said.\n“But that decision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation,” he said.\nPrice pressures, while volatile, will likely fall over time, Bostic said, citing five reasons. Shelter prices, a persistent spur to inflation, will probably fall over time and the economy will gradually cool, he predicted.\nEconomic growth and consumer spending have defied predictions of a downturn this year.\nGross domestic product rose at a 2.8% annual rate during the third quarter after increasing 1.4% in Q1 and 3% in Q2, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nThe Atlanta Fed on Monday upgraded its estimate for GDP growth during the current quarter to an annual rate of 3.2% from 2.7%.\nDespite robust growth, price pressures will likely subside because consumers’ inflation expectations have remained stable and household savings rates have declined, reducing fuel for economic growth, Bostic said. Also, operating costs among businesses continue to stabilize and their pricing power has fallen.\nStill, Waller likened combat against inflation to battling a wily opponent in the blood sport of mixed martial arts.\n“I feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute,” Waller said. “But let me assure you that submission is inevitable — inflation isn't getting out of the octagon.”\nRecommended Reading \nInflation slows, spurring bets Fed will start cutting rates in May"

        "article_content": "Economic shifts are on the horizon, affecting taxes, healthcare and housing as the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump approaches.\nLearn More: 3 Things Retirees Should Sell To Build Their Retirement Savings\nFind Out: How To Financially Plan for the New Year Under the New Trump Presidency\nBaby boomers face specific challenges and opportunities to boost their financial security while planning for long-term health needs.\nWhether you’re looking to maximize your savings, refinance your house or plan for caregiving responsibilities, the Trump economy begins. Here are four money moves boomers should make before Inauguration Day.\nThe major economic policy changes of the incoming Trump administration are likely to include a combination of regulatory rollbacks, tighter immigration controls, and import tariffs, said Stuart Schiffman, founder and managing partner of Compound Wealth Advisors.\n“While we don’t know the magnitude of these policy changes, it would be prudent for boomers who anticipate retiring in the next few years to have ample cash on hand to pay for living expenses,” Schiffman said. “The extra cash cushion may be needed to avoid selling stocks during a market dip. Losses in the early years of retirement can never be recouped if the principal is spent.”\nRead Next: Avoid This Retirement Savings Mistake That’s Costing Americans Up To $300K\nShifts in healthcare policy also call for prioritizing budgeting and savings.\nChristopher Stroup, founder and president of Silicon Beach Planning, said boomers should periodically review the government programs available because eligibility and benefits for Medicaid or other support systems may change.\nFor example, President-elect Donald Trump appointed Dr. Mehmet Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\nOverseeing federal healthcare programs that serve 160 million Americans, CMS is one of the most powerful government agencies. Oz is a board-certified heart surgeon and a former television talk show host who has come under fire for his skepticism of his stance on COVID-19 vaccines.\nWhile Dr. Oz unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate from Pennsylvania in 2022, he doesn’t have experience running a federal bureaucracy. Nevertheless, Dr. Oz has advocated for government health insurance for those who can’t afford it and suggested implementing a 20% payroll tax to privatize Medicare fully.\n“Boomers should consider setting up a dedicated savings fund specially for healthcare and long-term care expenses,” Stroup said. “An effective way to do this is through a Health Savings Account (HSA) if eligible, or a separate investment account that is earmarked for future healthcare needs Having personal savings can ensure they aren’t caught off guard.”\nOne option for boomers is to save for policy changes that could affect their wallet and retirement savings is to allocate a portion of their assets to fixed indexed annuities, which provide both protection of principal and guaranteed income for life.\n“Many retirees value those benefits, and there could be other positives beyond those provided by annuities,” said Tom Buckingham, Chief Growth Officer at Nassau Financial Group.\n“By allocating a portion of their assets to annuities that provide a stable source of income, boomers could allocate other assets to equities, real estate or other risk assets that might benefit from an inflationary environment.”\nNow might be a favorable time to refinance your house, especially for boomers who have a mortgage with a higher interest rate.\n“Even though interest rates have been rising in recent years, they’re still relatively low compared to historical norms,” Stroup said. “So, refinancing could help secure a lower rate and reduce monthly payments.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nBarbara Corcoran: If Mortgage Rates Hit This Number, the Market Will \"Go Ballistic\"\n13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You\nThese 11 Rare Coins Sold for Over $1 Million\nI'm a Retirement Planner: 7 Ways I Am Guiding Clients Now That Trump Won\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: The Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Boomers Should Make Before Inauguration Day"

        "article_content": "By Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in November as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and online merchandise, consistent with strong underlying momentum in the economy as the year winds down.\nThe report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday had no impact on expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates on Wednesday for the third time since the U.S. central bank initiated its policy easing cycle in September.\nFed officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Signs of strong domestic demand added to warmer inflation readings in recent months in suggesting that the Fed could pause rate cuts in January.\nPolicies planned by President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, including tariffs on imports and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, are also seen complicating matters for the central bank.\n\"The market is still discounting a 25-basis-points rate cut tomorrow, but if consumers are still buying interest-sensitive goods like autos, a rational markets observer would have to wonder why would a central bank add fuel to the fire with a president-elect coming in at the end of January with one of the most pro-growth agendas of any president in history,\" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS.\nRetail sales jumped 0.7% last month after an upwardly revised 0.5% gain in October, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, advancing 0.5%. Estimates ranged from a 0.1% dip to a 1.0% surge.\nRetail sales increased 3.8% year-on-year in November.\nLabor market resilience, characterized by historically low layoffs and strong wage growth, is underpinning consumer spending.\nStrong household balance sheets, reflecting record stock market prices and high home prices, are also driving spending.\nHousehold savings remain supportive.\nEconomists expect policymakers will signal fewer rate cuts in 2025 when they update their summary of economic projections on Wednesday. The Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate is currently in the 4.50%-4.75% range, having been hiked by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023.\n\"Unless the labor market materially weakens, investors should expect the Fed to ease rates next year but not as much as originally hoped,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.\nStocks on Wall Street traded lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields ticked up.\nTARIFFS FEARED\nThe solid increase in retail sales came despite a late Thanksgiving holiday that pushed Cyber Monday into December, and was consistent with a strong start to the holiday shopping season. Sales at auto dealerships jumped 2.6%, likely boosted by residents replacing motor vehicles damaged by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Online retail sales vaulted 1.8%, probably reflecting early holiday promotions.\nReceipts at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores increased 0.9%. Building material and garden equipment store sales rose 0.4%, likely as residents rebuilt in areas devastated by Helene and Milton.\nThere were also decent gains in sales at electronics and appliance stores as well as furniture outlets.\nBut there were pockets of weakness and hints of belt tightening among some consumers, especially low-income households.\nThough layoffs remain low, hiring has cooled down. Consumer debt loads are expanding.\nReceipts at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, fell 0.4% after increasing 0.9% in October. Economists view dining out as a key indicator of household finances.\nSales at clothing stores decreased 0.2%. Grocery store sales also declined 0.2%. Sales at miscellaneous retailers, which include florists and gift shops, dropped 3.5%, extending the prior month's decline.\nNonetheless, consumers generally remain in good shape.\nRetail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.4% last month after a 0.1% dip in October.\nThese so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They rose 0.3% after adjusting for inflation. Growth in core retail sales averaged a 6.5% annualized rate in the last three months. Economists estimated that consumer spending was running at around a 3.0% pace so far in the fourth quarter.\nConsumer spending grew at a 3.5% rate in the third quarter, accounting for most of the economy's 2.8% pace of expansion during that period. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.1% pace in the fourth quarter.\n\"We expect households to keep spending into the new year, but for the pace of consumption to slow as the year progresses and tariff-related price pressure bites,\" said Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo. \"While the broad household sector is still in a decent financial position today, data suggest consumers are growing more vulnerable amid slowing real income growth and still-high financing costs.\"\nWhile consumers continue to carry the economy on their shoulders, manufacturing remains downbeat in part because of the lingering effects of the Fed's policy tightening and crippling strike by factory workers at Boeing.\nFactory output increased 0.2% in November after a downwardly revised 0.7% decline in October, the Fed said. Economists had forecast production rebounding 0.5% after a previously reported 0.5% decrease.\nThough the Boeing strike ended in early November, production of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment fell 2.6%. That was attributed to declines in the manufacturing of aircraft parts, and followed a 6.7% tumble in October. It partially offset a 3.5% jump in motor vehicle and parts output.\nTariffs loom over the sector next year.\n\"The threat of tariffs on imported raw materials and intermediate goods likely will stimulate manufacturing output briefly, as firms seek to increase inventory and control costs,\" said Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\"Nonetheless ... we think that heightened uncertainty over tariff and immigration policy will dissuade manufacturers from investing in additional capacity until the policy picture is clearer.\"\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

        "date": "2024-09-05T17:10:04.000Z",
        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has been describing President Joe Biden's administration as a disaster for the economy while presenting himself as the man who will correct course. But analysts from Goldman Sachs warn that it's Trump who would jeopardize an economic recovery with wrongheaded ideas on trade, immigration and other issues.\nAccording to a report released by the investment bank on Tuesday and shared with several news outlets, Trump's policies, if implemented, could cut into the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as half a percentage point in 2025 before it rebounds. Even a small decrease in GDP or just slow growth could lead to widespread unemployment, pay cuts and struggling businesses.\n“We estimate that if Trump wins in a sweep or with divided government, the hit to growth from tariffs and tighter immigration policy would outweigh the positive fiscal impulse,” the report said, echoing previous warnings by economists who say that Trump's proposals to raise tariffs and cut taxes will also increase the deficit and inflation rate, not lower them as he has promised.\nOn the other hand, Goldman predicted that a Kamala Harris presidency and Democratic control of Congress would lead to better economic outcomes, suggesting that spending initiatives and tax credits would \"more than offset\" any investment slowdown caused by the higher corporate income tax rate that Harris has proposed on the campaign trail. If Harris wins but Congress is divided, the report said, policy changes would be \"small\" and have little to no effect on the GDP.\nEither potential administration may have to deal with changed economic conditions. The Federal Reserve is expected this month to make its first interest rate cut in five years, which some economists view as a sign of confidence amid slowing inflation, while others warn it could send the wrong message about a potential recession and spook investors.\nThe Harris campaign was quick to capitalize on the Goldman report. “Vice President Harris has a positive vision to strengthen the economy by building up the middle class, cutting taxes and lowering costs for working families and small businesses, and creating opportunities for all Americans to get ahead,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"On the economy, the choice could not be any more clear this November.\""

        "article_content": "(Bloomberg) -- One of the last remaining bright spots for Chinese consumption is rapidly fading, as the nation’s economic malaise takes a toll on demand for even the most accessible of goods.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nDense Cities With Low Emissions Suffer Most From Air Pollution, Study Finds\nA Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine\nIntergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints\nAs Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow\nIn the latest warning to global markets on the health of the Chinese economy, Temu-owner PDD Holdings Inc. on Monday surprised investors with an unusually gloomy outlook. The e-commerce firm, which became a market darling with low-priced goods that helped propel business during China’s economic downturn, also reported revenue that missed estimates. During a post-earnings briefing, CEO Chen Lei mentioned at least eight times that revenue and profits must “inevitably” decline as economic growth slows.\n“We are seeing many new challenges ahead, from changing consumer demand, intensifying competition, and uncertainties in global environment,” Chen, also one of PDD’s earliest employees, told analysts.\nListen to the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nThe CEO and his lieutenants were careful to stress they remained confident in Chinese consumption over the longer term — a big priority for Beijing in rebalancing the world’s No. 2 economy. But the damage was done. PDD’s shares plunged 29% in their biggest fall on record, wiping out $55 billion of market value. Its closest rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. followed suit, sliding about 4% in Hong Kong.\nPDD’s warning stunned investors because the company was long viewed as the main beneficiary of a Chinese “consumer downgrade” — its low-pricing strategy on Pinduoduo domestically and Temu abroad was intended to appeal to cost-conscious shoppers at a time of unprecedented economic volatility.\nThe disappointing results were the latest in a series of red flags about the Chinese economy. On Tuesday, China’s biggest bottled water producer Nongfu Spring Co. reported the slowest half-year profit growth since its listing in 2020, while popular fast food chain Din Tai Fung — long one of the most popular restaurant brands across the country — revealed this week it was shutting more than a dozen outlets.\nLast month, Starbucks Corp. disclosed a 14% drop in Chinese revenue in the June quarter.\n“The big issue is weakness in China consumer,” said Joshua Crabb, head of Asia Pacific equities at Robeco Hong Kong Ltd. “The read-across for competition and a weak consumer will be negative for sure.”\nWhile Starbucks and Din Tai Fung have long wrestled with volatile sentiment, PDD’s warnings were especially surprising given it encapsulated for years how cash-strapped Chinese consumers spurned luxury brands for lower-end alternatives.\nFounded by ex-Google engineer Colin Huang in 2014, the company in past years has combined low prices with aggressive rural expansion and game-like elements on its platform to grab market share from Alibaba and JD. It parlayed that formula into the global e-commerce bargains app Temu, which it launched during the Super Bowl in 2023. It’s become a shopping phenom akin to Shein, becoming for a time one of the most downloaded US apps.\nThat drove a remarkable six-fold gain in PDD’s market value from the post-Covid troughs of 2022, crowning Huang China’s richest person this month. But he held the mantle for just 18 days, till Monday’s selloff.\nChina’s less affluent consumers outside of glitzy mega cities drove much of PDD’s success. They’re now a big source of uncertainty.\nCHINA INSIGHT: PDD’s Dive Shows E-Commerce Limits to Consumption\nConsumption, a main driver of the economy, weakened this year after a rebound in post-Covid reopening spending last year. Against the backdrop of widespread job and salary cuts as well as plunging property prices, Chinese consumers have turned more cautious with their spending, spurring price wars in sectors such as cars.\n“Chinese e-commerce companies have run into a problem that even fierce price cutting won’t solve anymore — a weak consumer,” Bloomberg Economics’ Chang Shu and Eric Zhu wrote. “From a macroeconomic perspective, the plunge in PDD shares makes an emphatic point — slowing income gains and damaged confidence are depressing consumption.”\nRetail sales expanded just a little over 3% in the first seven months of 2024, far worse than the 8%-plus growth recorded in pre-pandemic times. Residents’ confidence in future income plunged to the worst level since the end of 2022, one of the most intense periods of Covid lockdowns, according to a central bank survey conducted in the second quarter.\nAlmost half of the residents polled said employment is “grim and difficult,” the highest proportion since the end of 2022. And nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they’re willing to save more, hovering near an all-time high recorded last year.\nLei signaled that there was a fundamental shift in consumer behavior, a move away from the bargain-basement products that have turbocharged revenue since its founding.\n“Consumers are making more thoughtful decisions to balance quality and value,” he said on the earnings call. “In response, we have collaborated with high-quality brands and manufacturers to create customized products that cater to these diverse demands.”\nFor some investors, PDD executives were merely trying to contain expectations run amok. After all, it may be unreasonable to expect the company to keep logging 50%-plus growth, as it’s done in all but one quarter on record. Wall Street was betting on PDD to almost double revenue during the June quarter. Instead, it rose 86%. On Monday, executives said they will make big investments to capitalize on future opportunities.\n“PDD is showing that reality will always reassert itself,” said Brock Silvers, managing director at private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital. “In the current environment, the most prudent course of action is to suffer no surprises. Better to announce bad news in advance than to risk being blamed for an even greater meltdown post hoc.”\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\nPDD’s indication on Aug. 26 of lower profitability as the company boosts spending to tackle increased global competition suggests downside to 2H earnings consensus, which was projecting higher margins into 2025. This, along with PDD’s first revenue miss in 10 quarters for the three months ended June, looks set to dampen the growth outlook for the next 12 months.\nCatherine Lim and Trini Tan, analysts\nClick here for the research.\nIn the long run, much depends on the job market, and how Beijing steers the economy.\nAuthorities have sought to ensure there are enough jobs even as the economy slowed, calling on state-owned enterprises to expand recruitment and vocational training.\nBut officials stopped short of providing more direct help to consumers, though many economists have called for a cash subsidy or consumption voucher for at least the low-income groups. They have also refrained from taking measures to support wage growth, which is essential to encourage more spending. Regulatory crackdowns in a number of industries ranging from private tutoring to finance over the past few years have also worsened the job market.\nFor now, many investors are still counting on PDD to at least outshine its peers in a turbulent economy.\nPDD’s result “implies weak consumption and intense competition. However, management’s comments on declining long-term profitability are too conservative, in our view,” Morgan Stanley analysts Eddy Wang and Kathy Zhu wrote.“We believe PDD is the only Chinese e-commerce player that will outperform industry growth.”\n--With assistance from Yujing Liu, Catherine Ngai, Dong Lyu, Zheping Huang, Lulu Shen and Karthikeyan Sundaram.\n(Updates with Nongfu’s earnings in the sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports\nHow Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis\nNeed 100,000 Balloons for a Convention?

        "article_content": "In this election year, inflation is a hot-button issue for both consumers and presidential candidates. The latest consumer price index (CPI) data released April 10 showed that inflation increased even higher than experts had anticipated in March, standing at 3.5% following a 3.2% increase in February. This figure remains higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.\nCheck Out: 7 Things the Middle Class Won’t Be Able To Afford in the Next 5 YearsRead Next: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nAnd the issue is top of mind for voters. According to a recent Data for Progress survey, 27% of voters identified “the economy, jobs, and inflation” as their top priority when deciding their vote — and among these respondents, 51% cited inflation as their primary concern within this category.\nYet, while the administration is saying that the “economy is going in the right direction,” many consumers still feel the pinch in their wallets.\n“We’re headed in the right direction as it relates to the economy,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre recently said on MSNBC‘s “Morning Joe.” “We pay attention to the data that showed consumer confidence was up, right, that showed that 14 million — more than 14 million jobs were created.

Those things matter.”\nLearn More: How Much Household Income Will Be Considered Upper Middle Class in 5 Years?\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nMichael Collins — CFA, founder and CEO of WinCap Financial — explained that there are a few potential reasons why Americans may still be feeling the pinch despite a strong economy.\n“One factor could be the lag time between economic growth and its effects on individual households,” said Collins. “While the economy may be improving overall, it can take time for those benefits to trickle down to everyday Americans.”\nCollins added that this could be due to a variety of factors such as wage stagnation, rising housing costs and increasing healthcare expenses.\nIn addition, while inflation has waned compared to a year ago, it does not erase the cumulative impact past inflation caused.\n“We have had a 20% increase to overall prices as tracked by CPI data since only 2020,” said Stephen Kates, CFP and principal financial analyst at Annuity.org. “This is the same amount that we had over the entire 2010s. It is hard for people to shake the stress of rising prices especially when prices were so unusually stable in the decade prior.”\nTo put this in context, inflation stood at 5% in March 2023 and 8.5% in March 2022 before reaching 9.1% in June 2022, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data.\nAs Jeffrey A. Rosenkranz, portfolio manager for Shelton Capital Management, noted, after rapid progress in the second half of 2023, inflation is no longer moderating quickly — and in many areas may be re-accelerating.\n“Many of the components that consumers see on a daily basis are the ones where progress has been stubborn lately,” he said.\nIn essence, he argued, this is a timing mismatch — as the economy is recovering, labor markets are tight and wages have been pushed higher over the past few years.\n“Americans don’t necessarily think about that every day — whereas every time they fill up at the pump, or buy eggs and milk at the market, or eat a meal out even at a fast-food restaurant, they are reminded of these pockets of inflation that are persistent,” he said.\nHe added that, ironically, some of the components of inflation people don’t see every day — such as car prices or large durable goods — have moderated in price.\n“It’s just that the average American doesn’t see the entire CPI basket every day and tends to have a disproportionate psychological reaction to movement in prices of recurring purchases,” he noted. “Today’s CPI report will do nothing to change this narrative anytime soon.”\nIn terms of specific areas that may be causing financial strain for consumers, food and gas prices in particular have been steadily increasing in recent months.\n“This can be attributed to a variety of factors such as global market fluctuations, weather events impacting crops and production, and political instability in key oil-producing countries,” said WinCap’s Collins.\nShelter costs, including rent and mortgage payments, continue to rise in many parts of the country, making it difficult for individuals and families to find affordable housing.\n“This can be especially challenging for those living in high-cost cities or areas with limited housing options,” he said.\nIndeed, the index for shelter rose in March, as did the index for gasoline. Combined, these two indexes contributed more than half of the monthly increase in the index for all items, according to the CPI release.\nSpecifically, the gasoline index increased 1.7% in  March — up 1.3% over the past year. Meanwhile, prices for shelter were up 0.4%, up a whopping 5.7% in the past year.\nAs for groceries, they continue to be “a weekly shock for much of America,” said Launch That’s Kates.\nIn March, the food index rose 0.1%, a 2.2% increase over the past year, according to CPI data.\nMeanwhile, prices for food at home — your grocery bill — are up 1.2% for the year. And in terms of food away from home — what you pay in restaurants — the index is up 4.2% for the year.\n“Add to that the fact that student loans are no longer in forbearance and many younger Americans, especially those with a family, feel the walls closing in on them,” said Kates. He added that the prolific rise in stock and house prices only help those who have substantial assets in stocks and houses, which excludes a lot of young people.\n“They are particularly vulnerable to feeling financially overwhelmed in this economy,” he added.\nYet, some experts also pointed out that the current economic landscape has different impacts on different people, largely depending on their financial position.\nFor relatively wealthy individuals — those with high incomes and minimal debt (aside from low-rate mortgages) — the current economy is very good, said Thomas Brock, CFA, CPA, and expert contributor for Annuity.org.\n“Persistent inflationary pressure has been less-than-ideal, but quite manageable, given their ample cash flows. Additionally, the high interest rates implemented to combat inflation have been a boon to their income-oriented investment holdings. All the while, a robust stock market has bolstered confidence,” he added.\nMeanwhile, for financially disadvantaged individuals, the current economy is difficult to tolerate, providing virtually no opportunity to thrive, he said.\n“The surge in inflation, which surfaced in mid-2021 and continues to smolder today, has been crippling. It has busted budgets, diminished liquidity and caused a surge in credit card debt, all of which has been exacerbated by the dramatic rise in interest rates,” he added.\nMatt Willer, managing director of capital markets and partner at Phoenix Capital Group Holdings, echoed the above sentiment. He noted that food costs are up considerably, as are energy costs, and “Anyone who carries a credit card balance has a materially higher minimum monthly payment than a few years back.”\n“The cost of capital is elevated as it pertains to variable rate loans, or recently originated mortgages,” he said. “The average American isn’t a software engineer for NVIDIA, they are everyday folks that are experiencing a cost of living increase that far outpaces the rate of wage gains.”\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Karine Jean-Pierre Says the Economy Is Going in the Right Direction — But Why Don’t Americans Feel It In Their Wallets?"

        "date": "2024-06-26T10:54:56.000Z",
        "article_content": "The era of the knowledge economy is giving way to a new paradigm where relationships hold the key to success, according to LinkedIn’s chief economist, Karin Kimbrough.\nSpeaking to Fortune at Cannes Lions on emerging trends in the job market now that AI adoption among global businesses is in full swing, Kimbrough highlighted a significant shift from a heavily weighted knowledge-based edge to one where interpersonal skills are equally paramount.\n\"We've been in an economy where knowledge was your power, your ability to put your hands on different information quickly and then synthesize it, or deliver it, was really your extra edge,\" Kimbrough explained, who has been at the Microsoft-owned professional social media platform since 2020.\n\"And I think we're moving to a point where we see relationships as being part of the other side of that coin. So almost the relationship economy.\"\nKimbrough emphasized that while knowledge remains crucial, the growing importance of relationships is undeniable.\n\"What we're seeing is obviously an increasing demand for AI skills, whether they're AI expertise skills or AI aptitude skills. But so is the demand for the human or people skills, the ones that actually tell you: ‘I have judgment, I can problem solve, I have critical thinking, I can negotiate’,\" she noted.\nThis dual rise in demand for both AI and human skills indicates a broader trend.\n\"The anxiety around replacement is probably not the case, and frankly, it's very rare in history that technology replaces jobs in a widespread fashion. It's more likely you just rotate what you're doing within your job,\" Kimbrough said.\nLinkedIn’s chief operating officer, Dan Shapero, pointed out a pivotal change in interview dynamics due to the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence worldwide.\n\"The number one interview question of 2024 is ‘tell me about how you use AI in your job?’\" Shapero revealed.\nThis question aims to help leaders identify candidates who are adept at integrating new technologies into their work, separating them from those who are hesitant to adopt such changes.\nShapero added: \"You’re going to see organizations trying to transition their employees to learn how to use these skills and hire people that are more comfortable with these things in the hiring process.\"\nKimbrough also dispelled the notion that AI adoption is generational.\n\"It's not that it’s only Gen Z's using it and the boomers are terrified. It's really more of a mindset. And you see as many folks in the older generations as younger generations experimenting and playing around with it,\" she said.\nThe underlying message from both Kimbrough and Shapero is clear: adaptability to new technologies like AI is crucial. \"It's not necessarily that AI is taking your job away, but someone in your profession that's using AI. This is what history tells us. The people that learn how to use new technology tend to thrive, and the people who don't tend to stumble,\" Shapero warned.\nHe encouraged people to start small with AI to overcome their initial apprehensions.\n\"These are very simple human questions that people can start with that don't take them directly into their career space but will start to help you understand what this technology can and can't do,\" Shapero advised.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "By Dan Burns\n(Reuters) -U.S. presidential elections are all about \"the economy, stupid\", said Bill Clinton's strategist James Carville in 1992.\nAnd for American voters who cared more about the economy than other issues - and the nearly half who said they are worse off financially than four years ago - their choice for the next president appeared resoundingly clear: Republican Donald Trump.\nIndeed, Trump emerged as the winner early on Wednesday, with broad disaffection about the state of the economy a main reason why he outpolled Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent.\nAbout 31% of voters said the economy was their top issue, ranking second behind the 35% who said the state of democracy mattered most to them, according to national exit polling data from Edison Research. And the voters who identified the economy as their primary concern voted overwhelmingly for Trump over Harris - 79% to 20%.\nMeanwhile, the high inflation of the last couple of years and the toll that has taken on perceptions of financial well-being stood out as clear concerns that also steered voters toward Trump.\nMore than half of voters said inflation had caused them a moderate hardship in the last year, while nearly one in four said it had caused a severe hardship. Those saying it had caused a moderate difficulty leaned somewhat more to Trump, 50% to 47%, but 73% of those calling it a severe hardship voted for the former president.\nEdison's exit polling data showed 45% of voters across the country said their family's financial situation was worse today than four years ago, compared with just 20% in 2020. Those voters favored Trump over Harris 80% to 17%.\nThe results dovetail with surveys that have shown consumers giving the economy poor ratings even though unemployment is near historic lows, growth overall has been largely above trend, consumer spending remains robust, and overall household wealth is at a record high.\nThe University of Michigan's twice-monthly Consumer Sentiment Index, for instance, plunged to a record low in the summer of 2022 when inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index peaked at 9.1% year-over-year - the highest since the early 1980s.\nWhile it has improved in the two years since as stiff interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve have brought inflation back to near the central bank's 2% target, sentiment remains well below the levels that prevailed during Trump's first term from 2017 to 2021.\n(Editing by Catherine Evans)"

        "article_content": "Instability spiked across the stock market in April, with Wall Street’s fear gauge lately climbing to its highest level since Halloween. The Cboe Volatility Index has been trading near its long-term average this week. Dashing hopes of an interest rate cut soon, thanks to sticky inflation, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East dampened investors’ sentiment.\nHowever, market participants shouldn’t be disheartened! This is because the U.S. economy’s recent standout performance squashed fears about an impending recession. Despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy stance, the U.S. economy expanded at an encouraging pace since last summer.\nThe third quarter GDP of 2023 increased to 4.9%, followed by an uptick of 3.4% in the fourth quarter. And now, economists largely expect the U.S. economy to have expanded nearly 3% in the first three months of 2024.\nThe economy, by the way, isn’t expanding on the stimulus provided during the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, resilient consumers, employment growth and robust productivity are driving it. Thus, the underlying strength of the economy would eventually ward off any gyration in the stock market.\nSales at U.S. retailers increased more than anticipated in March on the back of strong employment gains, a low unemployment rate, and fewer layoffs. Improvement in wages also increased consumer outlays, which account for most of the economic activity. At the same time, workers' productivity has grown in recent times way more than in the years preceding the pandemic and consequently boosted economic growth.\nRecently, the Washington-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its prediction of U.S. economic growth to 2.7% for this year, up 0.6% from its forecast in January. IMF expects economic growth in the United States to outpace other advanced economies, and in particular the European economy. The rise in energy prices and higher interest rates continue to hamper growth in the Eurozone.\nNonetheless, with the U.S. economy chugging along and the stock market expected to climb north sooner than later, it is judicious for shrewd investors to place bets on stocks such as Comfort Systems USA, Inc. FIX, High Tide Inc. HITI, CuriosityStream Inc. CURI and Turtle Beach Corporation HEAR that are well-poised to scale upward.\nThese stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\nComfort Systems USA is a national provider of comprehensive heating, ventilation, and air conditioning installation.

        "date": "2024-12-31T21:28:54.000Z",
        "article_content": "The market outlook for 2025 sees U.S. GDP growing at a healthy rate, the stock market gains diversifying beyond the Magnificent Seven—with health care a likely winner—and an evolution in the AI sector that powered virtually all of last year’s rally.\nInvestors are eyeing 2025 with an eager optimism, hoping the markets will continue their strong performance from 2024.\nThe economy is on solid footing as inflation continues to come down and the labor market is stable enough to keep the Fed satisfied. The stock market finished another gangbusters year, up 24%. It doesn’t hurt that the business community got their candidate of choice in the November election. President-elect Donald Trump pledged to cut taxes and regulations, two campaign promises that are always welcome news to investors.\nAs 2025 begins, Fortune compiled a list of major market and economic predictions for the year ahead:\nThe economic growth that characterized the U.S. economy in 2024 is expected to continue, although not quite at the same levels. Goldman Sachs forecasts a 2.5% increase in the U.S. GDP compared to its 2.8% growth in 2024. Despite that slight dip, the healthy 2.5% clip would indicate the widespread recession fears of 2022 and 2023 have mostly been abated. Instead, the markets expect a growing economy that should keep investors feeling satisfied. Those positive feelings will also extend to consumers, the backbone of the U.S. economy, according to Goldman. As inflation keeps coming down, consumers should start to see lower prices and, perhaps more importantly, start to feel better about their finances. “Consumer spending should remain the core pillar of strong growth, supported both by rising real income driven by a solid labor market and by an extra boost from wealth effects,” Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in November.\nThe S&P 500 will finish with gains north of 20% for consecutive years for the first time since 1998. So it makes sense that the tale of the stock market in 2025 will be similar to that of the overall economy: slightly worse than the year before, but still growing strong. For investors, that represents a rosy picture for the coming year. Fears of a recession or an unsustainably top-heavy S&P 500 seem to be in the rearview mirror. JPMorgan estimates a roughly 10% increase in the S&P 500 for 2025, according to an analyst forecast. While not an especially bullish projection, it comes as a change of heart from the banking giant, which earlier in 2024 had expected the stock market to struggle in 2025. Morgan Stanley also expected a similar increase in the S&P 500, although its bull scenario saw the index rise up to 7,400, which would mean about a 25% increase from current levels, according to a November report.\nFor the past two years, the group of megacap tech stocks dubbed the Magnificent Seven powered U.S. equities to their historic performances. They delivered record returns. For the average investor, that was welcome news. However, those select few companies represented 50% of the total gains across the S&P 500 as of October, a worrying trend that some feared was indicative of deeper, underlying problems with U.S. markets. In 2025, those fears may be assuaged by the fact that Wall Street expects a variety of sectors to deliver returns. Goldman Sachs recommends overweighting defensive sectors in 2025 because “of the level of growth optimism already priced into the equity market today,” the bank wrote in an analyst note. For 2025, the bank is eyeing the materials, software, health care, utilities, and real estate sectors, predicting those would be the most likely to exceed the S&P 500 by at least five percentage points.\nAs market gains diversify, analysts are keeping close tabs on the health care sector in 2025, which underperformed compared to the broader market in 2024. Goldman Sachs sees the sector trading at “historically low valuations,” which make it an appetizing investment. The sector is poised to grow in the coming year because it stands to benefit more than others from the technological advancements of artificial intelligence, which can speed up drug discovery and reduce labor costs, according to JPMorgan.\nIf the rise of artificial intelligence characterized the stock market surges of 2023 and 2024, then 2025 will be the year the technology sticks around for good.\nThat's not to say the market will look exactly as it did over the last two years, when much of the gains were concentrated in cloud computing and chip manufacturing. (Though those stocks certainly won’t falter, as evidenced by Broadcom becoming the latest trillion-dollar company.) Expect the market to shift toward companies that supply the AI industry with the power they need to develop and train their new models, according to analysts from Bernstein Private Wealth Management.\nBig Tech players like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta have all said they plan to increase their capital expenditures on AI by billions of dollars in 2025. Much of that spending will go toward building the infrastructure needed to keep developing AI. It could be several years before those investments translate into top- and bottom-line growth. Instead, the Street expects the companies building the data centers to be major beneficiaries.\n“Investment portfolios would likely benefit from exposure to the infrastructure beneficiaries of generative AI—e.g. electricity production, transmission, and storage, as well as data center/server farm construction, and data transmission—where the eventual spending may take a decade or more to arrive,” the Royal Bank of Canada wrote in a December report.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-10-07T15:22:17.000Z",
        "article_content": "Russia's economy is in much worse shape than it looks, which could potentially force Vladimir Putin to stop waging war on Ukraine as early as next year, according to economist and author Anders Åslund.\nIn a recent op-ed on Project Syndicate, he cited financial, technological, and demographic headwinds weighing on a Russian economy that's headed for \"near stagnation,\" and estimated Western sanctions are reducing GDP by 2%–3% each year.\n\"Moreover, the situation will get only worse for Putin, perhaps even impeding his campaign of aggression against Ukraine,\" Åslund added.\nHe noted that Ukraine's spy service claimed last month to have Russian documents that indicate the Kremlin wants to conclude the war as soon as late 2025 amid tightening economic and financial pressure.\n\"Whether true or not, this scenario would make sense,\" Åslund, who wrote Russia’s Crony Capitalism: The Path from Market Economy to Kleptocracy, said.\nFor one thing, Western sanctions have stoked \"hidden inflation\" in Russia while preventing it from raising funds on global financial markets and instead forcing it to rely on reserves.\nAmid the constraints, the Kremlin has limited its annual budget deficit to 2% of GDP, or about $40 billion. But given that liquid reserves in Russia’s national wealth fund had been whittled down to $55 billion as of March, state reserves should run out next year, he said.\nMeanwhile, Russia's technological backwardness has been aggravated by the brain drain of the best and the brightest fleeing the country after the invasion as well as Western sanctions, Soviet-like repression, and Putin's \"kleptocracy,\" Åslund added.\nElsewhere in Russia's economy, weapons exports have collapsed as demand from the country's own troops prevents sales to foreign countries. Putin's war machine also has a manpower problem as low unemployment, the mass exodus of Russians, and mounting war casualties limit the ability to raise more troops.\nWith financial reserves running dry, Russia will have trouble making the budget math work. Åslund estimated that Russia will spend about $190 billion, or 10% of GDP, on the war this year, and the Kremlin is running out of places to cut from—other than war expenses—as the invasion nears its three-year anniversary.\n\"Ukraine could win the war if it had an additional $50 billion per year, as well as a green light to bomb military targets inside Russia,\" he said.\nOthers have also issued dire assessments of Russia's economy. The Bank of Finland’s institute for emerging economies published a report Thursday that said growth will slow to just 1% in 2025 and 2026 from 3.5% this year.\nTo maintain the current rate of growth, Russia would have to make major gains in productivity, but that's highly unlikely because of all the investment going into the military and the war, the report said.\nLabor shortages and the inability to buy spare parts or new equipment from the West will also hinder economic growth, it added.\n\"Given Russia’s myopic policy shifts, conditions in its wartime economy could change suddenly,\" the report said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

Redditors also sell physical goods and services on some of the site’s forums.\nOther social media companies have built marketplaces for selling and buying goods, including Meta Platforms Inc., which owns Facebook Marketplace and local neighborhood app Nextdoor, which Reddit considers competitors. In the coming months Reddit plans to launch new versions of awards, which are digital gifts users can give to each other, along with other products.\nWhile marketplaces can be rife with scams or fake goods, problems that have plagued other social media companies, Huffman said Reddit’s unique content moderation program helps prevent those challenges. On Reddit, comments and posts become popular only if they are “upvoted” by other users, meaning that users find the content valuable or helpful. Huffman said the voting system helps ensure that good and authentic content is shown more readily than scams. “Reddit is really good at finding the good content from a sea of noise,” he said.\nReddit also plans to continue striking data licensing deals with artificial intelligence companies, expanding into international markets and evaluating potential acquisition targets in areas such as search, he said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits\nUS East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia’s Shifting Exports\nCheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges\n‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

        "date": "2024-09-09T18:45:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "U.S. stock markets have maintained their northward journey in 2024 after an astonishing rally in 2023. Despite the recent mayhem, year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have advanced 7%, 14% and 13%, respectively. However, a qualitative difference appeared between the rally of 2023 and 2024.\nLast year, the rally was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology globally was the prime factor. This year, the rally is much broad-based. Several old economy stocks from sectors such as industrials, finance, utility, materials and consumer defensive have popped year to date.\nHere we have selected five old economy stocks that have provided higher returns than the broad-market index — S&P 500 — year to date. These are: Newmont Corp. NEM, Parker-Hannifin Corp. PH, Crane Co. CR, Howmet Aerospace Inc. HWM and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM. These stocks have seen strong earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days and carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNewmont is making notable progress with its growth projects, including the Tanami expansion. The acquisition of Newcrest has also created an industry-leading portfolio with a multi-decade gold and copper production profile in the most favorable mining jurisdictions globally. The combination of NEM and Newcrest is expected to deliver significant value for shareholders and generate meaningful synergies.\nNEM also focuses on improving operational efficiency and returning value to shareholders. Higher gold prices will also drive NEM’s performance. Strong demand from central banks, a dovish Fed interest rate outlook and a surge in safe-haven demand triggered by geopolitical tensions have contributed to a rally in gold prices.\nZacks Rank #1 Newmont has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 47.3% and 75.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter, next-quarter, current-year and next-year earnings has improved over the last 60 days. The stock price of NEM has surged 21.6% year to date.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nParker-Hannifin is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment.\nHigher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered PH’s Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout are also aiding PH. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving PH’s margins.\nZacks Rank #2 Parker-Hannifin has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.3% and 4.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter, next-quarter, current-year and next-year earnings has improved over the last 30 days. The stock price of PH has climbed 24% year to date.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCrane manufactures and sells engineered industrial products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia. CR has three segments: Aerospace & Electronics, Process Flow Technologies, and Engineered Materials.\nZacks Rank#2 Crane has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 18.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter, current-year and next-year earnings has improved over the last 60 days. The stock price of CR has appreciated 20.4% year to date.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowmet Aerospace is benefiting from solid momentum in the commercial aerospace market, driven by robust build rates and wide-body aircraft recovery. HWM is also witnessing strength in its defense aerospace business on the back of rising U.S. & international defense budgets.\nRobust orders for engine spares for the F-35 program and spares and new builds for legacy fighters auger well for HWM. Given the strength in most of its served markets, HWM has built a sound liquidity position that supports its shareholder-friendly policies.\nZacks Rank #1 Howmet Aerospace has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12.6% and 40.8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter, next-quarter, current-year and next-year earnings have improved in the last 60 days. The stock price of HWM has soared 68.9% year to date.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nJPMorgan’s second-quarter 2024 results show a rebound in investment banking (IB) business. High rates, buyouts, opening branches and solid loan balance will aid JPM’s net interest income (NII), though higher funding costs will weigh on it.\nOur estimates for JPM’s NII (managed) and loans imply a CAGR of 1.8% and 3.8%, respectively, by 2026. While there has been a resurgence in JPM’s deal-making activities, a complete revival will still take some time.\nZacks Rank #2 JPMorgan has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.8% and 3.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter, next-quarter, current-year and next-year earnings have improved in the last 60 days. The stock price of JPM has jumped 24.9% year to date.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "article_content": "Earnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q3 behind us, let’s have a look at DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) and its peers.\nThe iPhone changed the world, ushering in the era of the “always-on” internet and “on-demand” services - anything someone could want is just a few taps away. Likewise, the gig economy sprang up in a similar fashion, with a proliferation of tech-enabled freelance labor marketplaces, which work hand and hand with many on demand services. Individuals can now work on demand too. What began with tech-enabled platforms that aggregated riders and drivers has expanded over the past decade to include food delivery, groceries, and now even a plumber or graphic designer are all just a few taps away.\nThe 6 gig economy stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 3% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 1.6% above.\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.\nFounded by Stanford students with the intent to build “the local, on-demand FedEx\", DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) operates an on-demand food delivery platform.\nDoorDash reported revenues of $2.71 billion, up 25% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.8%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates.\nInterestingly, the stock is up 9.5% since reporting and currently trades at $170.\nRead why we think that DoorDash is one of the best gig economy stocks, our full report is free. \nFormed through the 2013 merger of Elance and oDesk, Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) is an online platform where businesses and independent professionals connect to get work done.\nUpwork reported revenues of $193.8 million, up 10.3% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 5.3%. The business had a very strong quarter with EBITDA guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts’ expectations.\nUpwork delivered the highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The company reported 855,000 gmv, up 2.3% year on year. The market seems content with the results as the stock is up 2% since reporting. It currently trades at $14.89.\nIs now the time to buy Upwork? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\nCreated by IAC’s mergers of Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor, ANGI (NASDAQ: ANGI) operates the largest online marketplace for home services in the US.\nAngi reported revenues of $296.7 million, down 15.5% year on year, in line with analysts’ expectations. It was a mixed quarter as it posted an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates but a decline in its requests.\nAngi delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The company reported 4.49 million service requests, down 26% year on year. As expected, the stock is down 36.1% since the results and currently trades at $1.68.\nRead our full analysis of Angi’s results here. \nBased in Tel Aviv, Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR) operates a fixed price global freelance marketplace for digital services.\nFiverr reported revenues of $99.63 million, up 7.7% year on year.

Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump’s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025.\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

        "date": "2024-11-29T15:30:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Friday, November 29, 2024It’s Black Friday: the traditional day among retailers where holiday sales season begins and companies can put away the red ink on their ledger through the remainder of the year. This weekend appears to have gotten off to a good start, with online sales on Thanksgiving Day having gathered a better-than-expected $6.1 billion yesterday. Black Friday is anticipated to bring in $12+ billion in sales today.U.S. sales in stores for the biggest in-store shopping day of the year, are expected to grow nearly +10% year over year to $10.8 billion. An estimated 131.7 million people are expected to start their holiday shopping today, a full +70% of all holiday shoppers. Average spending per customer today is expected to reach an eye-opening $300.These are all quite healthy numbers. Pre-market futures are positive at this hour, although down from highs earlier this session. For the trading week, the Dow is up +0.57% so far, the S&P 500 is +0.14%, the Nasdaq +0.35% and +0.43% on the small-cap Russell 2000. Ahead of today’s open, the Dow is +100 points, the S&P +10, the Nasdaq +37 and the Russell +16 points.\nIn a normal week at the end of a calendar month (and this is the final trading day of November), we’ll see Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) for the previous month. It’s the preferred gauge of inflation for Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s committee, which meets again mid-December.October PCE came in as expected on month over month headline (+0.2%), core month over month (+0.03%), headline year over year (+2.3%) and core year over year (+2.8%). The monthly data is also in-line with prior-month prints, while the year-over-year numbers are +10 basis points (bps) on each.This speaks to a steady economy with inflation levels flat to lukewarm. It also expects to have gotten the Fed’s attention in terms of setting interest rates. The dot-plot as of this recent cutting trend says we’ll come down another 25 bps on December 18th; as of now — with plenty more inflation and employment data to come between now and then — we can still expect this, to bring the Fed funds rate to a range of 4.50-4.75%. Where we go from there, however, is very much in question.Questions or comments about this article and/or author? Click here>>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "date": "2024-09-29T13:00:37.000Z",
        "article_content": "\"Chaos.\" \"Destructive.\" \"A big hit to people's pocketbooks.\"\nThat's what the economy will look like under a second Trump administration, according to three economists across the policy spectrum, if the GOP presidential candidate enacts the two major policies he's promising on the campaign trail: huge tariffs and mass deportations.\nAmericans will face higher prices and product shortages from the tariffs, they say, while consumer spending will suffer and jobs remain unfilled, harming local economies dependent on immigrants.\nWhile they differ on degree, these experts all agree under these policies that the economy will go the same way — in the wrong direction.\nOn the stump, the former president has called for a 60% tariff on Chinese imports along with a blanket 10% to 20% on all remaining goods imported from other countries. This is an escalation of what Trump imposed during his first term, when his tariffs affected some $300 billion in imported goods — some of which Biden has not rolled back — according to Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, a centrist think tank.\n\"Imagine that happening to 10 times that amount of economic activity,\" Edelberg said, noting that equals $3 trillion in imported goods. \"What you're going to see is chaos.\"\nUS companies dependent on imports — and who will bear the cost of the tariffs, per Edelberg — will scramble to negotiate contracts, find other exporters offering lower prices, or try to source the goods stateside — all at the same time. Some will be successful. Many won't. And Americans may find that some of the goods they want won't be available.\n\"What you're gonna find is, for some period of time, empty warehouses and empty shelves,\" Edelberg said.\nRead more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?\nPrices on goods will also rise. That's not really up for debate, according to these three economists.\nNot only will prices on imported goods rise, but also prices on US-made goods will rise if imported materials are used to manufacture those products. US companies will just pass some of that tariff onto shoppers — \"a big hit to people's pocketbooks,\" Dean Baker, a senior economist at the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said.\nUS companies may also raise their prices even if they're unaffected by the tariffs.\n\"When companies are making their pricing decisions, they are looking at what their competitors are doing,\" Baker said.\nSo if the price of imported widgets rises to account for the tariff, then US companies that make widgets here will increase their prices — because they can — just not by as much to stay attractive to consumers by comparison.\nThe price of services could also rise. Take a hair salon. If many salons use imported hair coloring, but it's no longer available because of supply chain disruptions, then customers will flock to the one salon that uses hair dye made in the US.\n\"The hair salon who actually can dye hair may well jack up its prices because they're now the only game in town,\" Edelberg said.\nOverall, inflation would increase a percentage point under the 10% tariffs, Goldman Sachs' chief economist predicts, and would cost the average American household $2,600 a year, according to The Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\"To a family on a limited budget, on limited income [that] is going to be hugely onerous,\" said Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute.\nAnd those price increases won't be evenly distributed. Products most disrupted by the supply chain could see prices jump.\n\"I can imagine for particular products in particular categories, price spikes on the order of what we saw during COVID,\" Edelberg said.\nAnother ripple effect of imposing these tariffs is the retaliation that the US would face from other countries, which would not sit idly by. For instance, when Trump enacted tariffs in his first term, the affected countries targeted specific US industries with tariffs of their own, including Kentucky bourbon and Harley Davidson.\n\"This is really a pretty destructive kind of policy,\" Lachman said. \"It's just totally irresponsible.\"\nPhew. And that's just the tariffs.\nTrump is also calling for deportation of undocumented immigrants to the tune of 10 million to 20 million people. And there's a lot of confusion as to who is considered illegal. Trump's vice presidential hopeful, JD Vance, has said that migrants granted legal status under the Biden administration would also be sent back.\nAside from the logistics and massive amounts of money needed to execute deportations — to say nothing of the humanitarian crisis — the policy would kneecap the labor force of many key industries. Immigrants — both documented and not — make up a huge part of the workforce in agriculture, construction, services, and manufacturing.\nA sudden shortage of workers makes it harder for companies to produce goods and provide services, a recipe for more inflation.\n\"If we really did deport something like 30% of our agricultural labor force, there's no way food prices aren't going to go up,\" Baker said, \"and probably quite a bit.\"\nEdelberg expects many immigrants — even those here legally — would leave voluntarily because the country would be inhospitable. What they all would take with them is millions of dollars in consumer spending.\n\"Immigrants demand stuff and they supply labor that supplies stuff, and as economies grow those things basically go hand in hand,\" she said. \"So we can have fewer immigrants. It just means we're going to grow less.\"\nLocal economies with larger immigrant populations would get hit especially hard by deportations. Imagine, Edelberg said, a local pizza restaurant owner who decided to expand and took out a loan to purchase a new pizza oven.\n\"And now they've expanded, they owe money, they owe more rent, and they have no customers,\" she said. \"That is so painful for a local economy.\"\nJust how bad would the economy look? The three economists are divided.\nEdelberg offered the sunniest of the pessimistic outlooks. Put together, the effects of the tariffs and deportations would “shave off a lot of economic growth,\" she said, estimating a decline of 1 to 1.5 percentage points off the country's gross domestic product.\nThat, she said, may not be enough to send us into a recession, an outcome that Lachman said is very likely.\n\"If Trump is elected and if he does what he says he's going to do,\" Lachman said, \"it's going to be really rough sledding for the next four years.\"\nFormer Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey — a Republican — offered a dire warning this month when he told Semafor that Trump’s tariffs would lead to “Depression-era” unemployment. While Lachman thinks that's too far, Baker is of a different opinion.\n\"I think that's a very plausible story,\" he said.\n\"If you create all sorts of instability in the economy by high tariffs, by deporting a large segment of your workforce, and not letting more in, if you cut off the factors that are making your economy flexible, then it's very hard to get inflation down once it's started.\"\nJanna Herron is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-09-24T00:33:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "After the Federal Reserve’s 0.5-percentage-point interest-rate reduction last week, many experts say a soft landing for the economy is in store.\nThat means falling inflation without a recession. The Consumer Price Index gained 2.5% in the 12 months through August, the smallest increase since February 2021.\nThe Fed’s favored inflation indicator, the personal consumption expenditures price index, gained the same amount in the 12 months through July. The central bank’s inflation target is 2%.\nAs for the economy, GDP increased 3% annualized in the second quarter, up from 1.4% in the first quarter. And the Atlanta Fed’s GDP forecasting model predicts a 2.9% expansion for the third quarter.\nTo be sure, employment growth has slowed, which is what pushed the Fed to slash interest rates. Nonfarm payrolls climbed 142,000 last month, putting the three-month average at 116,000, the lowest since mid-2020.\nBut many experts believe Fed rate cuts will counteract that weakness. Rate reductions make a soft landing “very plausible,”  former Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo, now a professor at Harvard Law School, told Harvard Law Today.\nHowever, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon injects a note of caution. “Hopefully we’re on the way to a soft landing. I wouldn’t count my eggs,” he said at a conference last week. “I am a little more skeptical than other people. I give it lower odds.”\nHe’s not sure that inflation will “go away so easily.” It remains above its pre-Covid levels. “We may have gone from a lower inflation rate to a slightly higher rate,” Dimon said, according to Bloomberg.\nSign up for TheStreet's free daily newsletter.\nBut that’s no big deal, he maintained. “Down the road, whatever [inflation] is, we’ll deal with it. Economists are used to dealing with that. It’s not a disaster.”\nRelated: Vanguard lays out key investing strategy after Fed rate cut\nThe veteran economist David Rosenberg appears more worried about the economy than Dimon. “I don’t believe in fairy tales,” he said of a soft landing in an interview with MarketWatch. “The Fed is suffering from a classic case of cognitive dissonance.”\nCentral bank policy is too tight, Rosenberg said. The Fed’s 50-basis-point move was “nothing more than an acknowledgement that it had stayed too tight for too long,” he said.\nAll Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did \"was to sugar-coat the situation. How can he talk about the U.S. economy being solid at the same time he talked about downside risk to the labor market outweighing upside risk to inflation?”\nJoAnne Feeney, a veteran portfolio manager at Advisors Capital ($8 billion of assets under management), is more optimistic about the economy. It’s “in pretty good shape,” she wrote in a commentary.\nRelated: Experts cite stocks to buy after Fed rate cut\n“While some segments of the income distribution are struggling, and some industries are seeing weak demand, the aggregate picture remains healthy. We are not in a recession, and we don’t see a trigger that would lead to one anytime soon.”\nThat has definite implications for stocks, given what will likely be multiple Fed rate cuts, she said.\nHistorically, once the Fed starts lowering rates, value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks, and defensive stocks tend to outperform cyclicals. But that has generally happened when the Fed cut rates into a weak economy, Feeney noted.\nNow, rate cuts will benefit companies that want to borrow.

        "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter died Sunday at the age of 100 at his home in Plains, Georgia, the Carter Center said. Carter served one term as the 37th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981 but lived longer than any other US president.\nCarter led the country during a tumultuous time, as the economy struggled while tensions thickened abroad in the Middle East. Carter became known for his humanitarian approach to the job, and he was also responsible for the creation of the Departments of Energy and Education.\nWhen the Democratic politician from Georgia took office in the late 1970s, the country faced an energy crisis and a deteriorating economy. In a famous speech on April 18, 1977, Carter compared the energy crisis to \"the moral equivalent of war\" and predicted that money spent on imported oil would vastly increase by 1985. While the US was facing an energy shortage in 1977, Carter delivered his well-known fireside speech about conservation.\n\"All of us must learn to waste less energy,\" he said while sporting a knitted sweater. \"Simply by keeping our thermostats, for instance, at 65 degrees in the daytime and 55 degrees at night, we could save half the current shortage of natural gas. If we learn to live thrifty and remember the importance of helping our neighbors, then we can find ways to adjust.\"\nOn June 20, 1979, Carter had 32 solar water heating panels installed on the roof of the West Wing while his administration introduced tax credits for solar power.\nCarter also inherited an economy experiencing what was widely dubbed “stagflation,” featuring high inflation and little to no growth. In 1973, former President Richard Nixon ended the gold standard, which decreased the value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. With a rise in import prices came inflation and, in turn, unemployment. The joblessness rate fluctuated between 5.7% and 6% during Carter's presidency until 1980, when it jumped up to 7.8% amid recession. When Carter left office in 1981, it sat at 7.4%.\nCarter’s solution was to name Paul Volcker as chair of the Federal Reserve. Volcker sought to end inflation by raising interest rates.\n\"There are no easy answers — we will not solve inflation by increasing unemployment,\" Carter told the American Society of Newspaper Editors in a speech on April 11, 1978. \"We will not impose wage and price controls. We will work with measures that avoid both these extremes. ... It is a myth that the government itself can stop inflation. Success or failure in this overall effort will be largely determined by the actions of the private sector of our economy.\"\nThe Consumer Price Index peaked at nearly 15% annual growth in 1980.\nJames Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia.\nCarter graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1946 and served in the US Navy until 1961 when he left with the rank of lieutenant. He began running his family’s peanut farm in the mid-1950s and was elected to the Georgia State Senate in 1963 before winning the state's governorship in 1970.\nCivil rights became a major platform for Carter amid racial tensions in Georgia. In his inauguration speech, Carter said: \"The time of racial discrimination is over. … No poor, rural, weak, or Black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity for an education, a job, or simple justice.\"\nAfter being elected president in 1976, Carter created the Department of Education, partly to enforce civil rights and also as a means to increase accountability for education programs on a federal level.\nCarter's diplomatic efforts led to several foreign policy achievements. He helped foster the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel’s presidents, brokered the Panama Canal treaties, oversaw the SALT II nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union, and opened relations between the US and China.\nHowever, then came the Iranian Hostage Crisis in November 1979, in which 52 American diplomats and citizens were taken hostage at the US Embassy in Tehran. The hostages were not released until Carter’s last day in office in January 1981, despite numerous negotiation attempts by the Carter administration and a failed rescue mission, Operation Eagle Claw. The hostage crisis — along with increased inflation — weighed on Carter's approval ratings and contributed to Carter’s loss to Ronald Reagan in 1980.\nDespite suffering a few falls and illnesses in his later years, Carter remained active in his philanthropic efforts.\nHe was involved in Habitat for Humanity, participating in building projects well into his 90s, and wrote 34 books, including his memoir, \"A Full Life: Reflections at 90,\" and a book on the Middle East, \"We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land: A Plan That Will Work.\"\nWhen he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, cowrote their memoir, \"Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life,\" the two famously spoke of the writing experience as challenging for their marriage.\n\"One thing I hope people will learn from the book is not ever to try to write a book together, unless they want to terminate a marriage,\" Carter told the LA Times in 1987, adding: \"We were incompatible authors.\"\nThe two were married until Rosalynn's death on Nov. 19, 2023.\nCarter also founded the Carter Center at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which says its mission is \"devoted to issues relating to democracy and human rights.\" His work with the center largely contributed to him earning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.\n“It was impossible not to like Jimmy Carter,” former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote in her memoir, “The Downing Street Years.” “He was a deeply committed Christian and a man of obvious sincerity. He was also a man of marked intellectual ability with a grasp, rare among politicians, of science and the scientific method.”\nIn January 2021, Carter missed his first inauguration since his own, when President Joe Biden took the oath of office, as the former president stayed close to home amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTwo years later, it was announced that the 99-year-old Carter had entered hospice care.\nCarter is survived by his four children, 11 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren.\n—\nAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and healthcare policy for Yahoo Finance.

But investment research firm BCA Research has stuck its neck out to predict that the U.S. is about to fall into a recession and that the coming interest rate cuts will be too little, too late, to prevent it.\nGarry Evans, BCA's chief global asset allocation strategist, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" the other day that the economy is now breaking down and the labor market is deteriorating.\nEvans added that a few rate cuts in 2024 cannot prevent a recession because when the FED cuts rates, it can take about a year for the economy to see a positive impact.\nTrending Now:\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\nTwo consecutive quarters of decline in the economy typically define a recession. The average one can last 10 months to a year and a half. Although the U.S. is not officially in recession, a recent survey by Affirm Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM) showed that 60% of Americans think it is. That belief can become a self-fulfilling prophecy as consumers begin to reduce spending. Consumers are already struggling with record-high credit card debt and fees. Inflation has robbed many consumers of the savings they had accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSome real estate investment trusts (REITs) will perform poorly during a tough recession, but others may thrive. REIT subsectors such as retail, office and industrial may languish as tenants shut down businesses, leading to higher occupancy rates and reduced rental revenue. Hotel REITs could also suffer as consumer and business traveling diminishes.\nHowever, some REITs can handle a recession and may even perform better. Those who serve a substantial need, such as health care or working with an attractive niche during hard times, should prosper.\nThe health care REIT subsector should continue to perform well in a recession. People still need medical care no matter how the economy fares and health care REITs can refinance debt at lower levels to boost overall funds from operations. Two in particular stand out both in recent price performance and in dividend yield:\nAmerican Healthcare REIT\nAmerican Healthcare REIT Inc. (NYSE:AHR) is a newcomer to the REIT sector. The Irvine, CA-based self-managed Healthcare REIT owns and operates a portfolio of 318 properties across 36 states and in the U.K. Its portfolio includes clinical health care properties such as medical buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing facilities (SNF) and hospitals.\nAmerican Healthcare REIT was formed in 2021 and has had a total return of 57.19% since its IPO in January 2024. Since Aug. 1, its gain of 26.20% leads all health care REITs. In addition, American Healthcare's $1.00 per share quarterly dividend yields 4.91%.\nRead More:\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out.This is a paid advertisement.

Read them carefully before investing.\nInvestor alert: Triple-net properties can put a check in your pocket every quarter—a can’t-miss opportunity for accredited investors.\nOmega Healthcare Investors \nOmega Healthcare Investors Inc. (NYSE:OHI) is a Hunt Valley, MD, triple-net equity health care Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that provides financing, capital and triple-net leasing to 77 different operators among 900 senior housing, skilled nursing, and assisted living facilities in 42 states in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.\nOmega Healthcare Investors has operators who provide the day-to-day management of these facilities. Texas and Indiana are a few states with the largest Omega facilities.\nOne of Omega Healthcare's strengths has been its quarterly dividend of $0.67 per share, which presently yields 6.98%. The $2.68 annualized dividend will become even more attractive to income investors as interest rates move down on CDs, money markets and treasuries.\nResidential REITs are another subsector that has done well in 2024 and could continue to thrive in a recession, but only if the downturn is not extreme. In the recession of 2007, so many tenants were laid off that it decimated the occupancy levels in middle-income apartment complexes.\nHowever, one residential REIT, UMH Properties Inc. (NYSE:UMH), based in Freehold, NJ, rents and sells properties in 2,500 manufactured home communities across a dozen states. UMH has been in business since 1968 and had its IPO in 1985.\nA recession could boost UMH Properties because manufactured homes cost far less than single-family homes and are cheaper to rent than apartments. Lower interest rates alone will not solve the problem of a lack of affordable housing in the U.S. without a major decline in home prices.\nOne unique perk in UMH manufactured home communities is self-storage facilities managed by UMH staff on premises. UMH Properties also has licensed Mortgage Professionals to help finance the sales of its manufactured homes.\nOver the past four weeks, UMH Properties climbed 11.61%, and its $0.215 per share quarterly dividend yields 4.43%. It has raised the dividend several times over the past three years.\nIf BCA Research is right, a U.S. recession may be unavoidable. Recessions have historically created difficult times for Wall Street. However, having strong recession-resistant REITs such as the aforementioned in one's portfolio can help weather the storm.\nEquityMultiple's ‘Alpine Note — Basecamp Series' is turning heads and opening wallets. This short-term note investment offers investors a 9% rate of return (APY) with just a 3 month term and $5K minimum. The Basecamp rate is at a significant spread to t-bills. This healthy rate of return won't last long. With the Fed poised to cut interest rates in the near future, now could be the time to lock in a favorable rate of return with a flexible, relatively liquid investment option.\nWhat's more, Alpine Note — Basecamp can be rolled into another Alpine Note for compounding returns, or into another of EquityMultiple's rigorously vetted real estate investments, which also carry a minimum investment of just $5K. Basecamp is exclusively open to new investors on the EquityMultiple platform.\nThis article BCA Research Says The Economy Is On The Brink Of Recession, But These REITs Could Still Thrive originally appeared on Benzinga.com"

        "date": "2024-12-11T02:24:40.000Z",
        "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday vigorously defended his economic record while warning that the policies proposed by his successor would be a “major mistake” that would harm American consumers.\nIn a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Biden said his policies, focused on building “from the bottom up and the middle out,” have produced “the strongest economy in modern history.” The strength of the economy is particularly noticeable in comparison to other advanced nations, Biden said. “I don't know anybody [who] wouldn't change their economy for ours. Can you think of one, any major nation?”\nBiden celebrated the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, which he attributed to the new economic course he laid out. “In four short years, we've come a long way ... from the crisis we inherited,” he said. “We not only beat the pandemic, we broke from the economic orthodoxy that's failed this nation, in my view, for a long time, a theory that led to fewer jobs, less economic growth and bigger deficits.”\nBiden asserted that his focus on infrastructure, manufacturing and jobs is still paying dividends and will continue to deliver benefits if policymakers stay the course. “It was long past time for America to make a generational investment in our infrastructure, in our manufacturing base,” he said. “I know it’s been hard for many Americans to see, and I understand they’re just trying to figure out how to put three squares on the table. But I believe it was the right thing to do, not only to lift America out of economic crisis caused by a pandemic, but set America on a stronger course for the future.”\nAt the same time, Biden warned that the policies proposed by President-elect Donald Trump would undo much of the progress he believes the economy has made while driving up the deficit and forcing cuts to basic services like healthcare and veterans’ benefits. “By all accounts, the incoming administration is determined to return the country to another round of trickle-down economics and another tax cut for the very wealthy that will not be paid for, or if paid for, is going to have a real cost,” he said. “On top of that, he seems determined to impose steep, universal tariffs on all important goods brought into this country on the mistaken belief that foreign countries will bear the cost of those tariffs, rather than the American consumer.”\n“I believe this approach is a major mistake,” Biden said.\nIn particular, Biden said he hoped that Trump would not follow the Project 2025 plan laid out by the Heritage Foundation for a radical restructuring and downsizing of government. “I pray to God the President-elect throws away Project 2025,” he said. “I think it’d be an economic disaster for us.”\nOne thing working in favor of sustaining his investments in infrastructure and manufacturing is the fact that so much of the spending is in Republican-led states, Biden said. “The historic investments we made went to more red states than blue states, not a politically smart thing to do,” he said. “And I knew what I was doing. I know people will be angry but the reason [is] the red states ... need it more.” He said he doubted that the Trump administration would ultimately pull the plug on new job-creating industrial investments, including a battery plant in North Carolina and a solar panel factory in Georgia.\n“I believe the only way for presidents to lead America was to lead all of America,” Biden said. “And I believe the economy I'm leaving at the moment — and others could do better than I did, I'm not saying it was perfect — is the best economy, strongest economy in the world, and for all Americans, doing better.”\nFinal agenda: Although the president spent much of his speech looking back at his four years in office, White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients reminded everyone this week that the Biden administration still has more than a month to go — and an agenda it wants to accomplish.\nIn a memo Monday, Zients reportedly told White House staff that in its final 42 days, the administration plans to provide another round of student debt forgiveness, work toward a ceasefire in Gaza, provide more military aid to Ukraine and push Congress to provide disaster relief. He also noted that the $2,000 cap on prescription drug costs will go into effect for all Medicare participants starting in January.\n“There’s so much more we’re working on — we have announcements to come on everything from climate to conservation to AI [artificial intelligence] and more,” Zients said. “I know you and your teams are pushing forward on every issue, yard by yard. Thank you for making the most of this final 42-day sprint.”\nLike what you're reading? Sign up for our free newsletter."

        "article_content": "This article covers 7 Command Economy Countries and 7 Others with Big Government Presence, offering detailed insights into the countries with centrally planned economies. You can skip our analysis on free economies vs planned economies and go directly to Top 5 Command-Economy Countries in the World.\nIn a command economy, centralized governmental authority dictates the means of production. In juxtaposition, a free-market economy operates on the principles of supply and demand, where market dynamics determine output levels and price mechanisms. Traditionally, command economies have found footing in socialist or communist regimes, while free-market economies resonate with capitalist systems and democratic societies.\nIn practicality, economies seldom adhere strictly to either extreme. Rather, they navigate a nuanced continuum, amalgamating facets of both command and free-market structures. For instance, across Europe, pivotal industries may be under state ownership and administration, while in China, a communist regime has sanctioned specialized free trade to flourish. This spectrum showcases the intricate interplay between governmental intervention and market autonomy within diverse economic landscapes.\nIn a planned economy, the state's monopoly over resources facilitates the optimal utilization of economies of scale. Nonetheless, this centralized control often fails to incentivize workers adequately, leading to a decline in individual effort. Conversely, in a market-driven economy, the competitive landscape among firms ensures that heightened worker effort is duly recognized and rewarded.\nHowever, this competitive environment may hinder the full exploitation of economies of scale. Instead, per capita output growth in a market-oriented economy thrives on the relentless integration of new technologies, which gradually substitute labor with capital. As a consequence, the growth trajectory of a market economy typically surpasses that of a planned economy, particularly when the incentive to exert effort assumes paramount importance.\nThe discourse surrounding the merits and drawbacks of market economies versus planned economies is steeped in historical context. One school of thought posits that as industries expand and financial dominance consolidates, the relentless pursuit of maximum profit inevitably corrodes the fabric of free competition. \nIn this light, proponents argue that a planned economy, with its ability to emulate the intricacies of the price system, may be effective against the erosion of purchasing power. Conversely, critics contend that a planned economy risks stifling individual motivation and stands at odds with the fundamental tenets of the rule of law.\nChina is one of the best examples of a blend of free market and planned economy, often referred to as a mixed ownership economy. Since its restructuring in 1978, the country has endeavored to facilitate the amalgamation of state and private capital. Ultimately, state and private capital collaborate closely, fostering mutual support and cooperation.\nThe post-1978 economic reform was a spontaneous, evolutionary process wherein individuals seized emerging opportunities for trade and entrepreneurship, lifting themselves out of poverty. China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001 marked a significant turning point, invigorating the nonstate sector and catalyzing institutional reforms aimed at enhancing competition. These reforms not only fostered economic growth but also laid a solid foundation for further development.\nIn the two decades following this development, the trade relationship between the United States and China experienced a remarkable expansion. Presently, China stands as one of the largest export markets for U.S. goods and services, while the United States ranks among the top export markets for China. \nThis robust trade has brought benefits to the United States, including lower prices for consumers and increased profits for corporations. However, the United States remains discontent with certain aspects of its trade relations with China. In pursuit of its economic objectives, the Chinese government has infused subsidies into various industries with the aim of nurturing \"national champion\" companies. \nWhile some experts criticize these subsidies as wasteful, they also pose challenges for other countries whose companies struggle to compete against such substantial levels of state support. Moreover, the United States contends that many Chinese state-owned enterprises effectively serve as extensions of the government and do not operate under the same market forces as their private counterparts. In contrast, a large number of US industries and sectors are widely unregulated.\nThe absence of stringent regulations in the U.S. is evident in the behaviors of various market participants. For instance, the relaxed rules within the real estate industry have facilitated money laundering activities by criminals and kleptocrats and sanctioned foreign nationals through real estate investments. \nAccording to a study released in August 2021 by Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, drawing on a database of over 100 international real estate money laundering cases, more than $2.3 billion in illicit funds were laundered through U.S. real estate between 2015 and 2020. \nAnother arena that lacks stringent regulations is the technology sector, which has been embroiled in numerous legal entanglements throughout its history. One notable example is the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) antitrust case, which emerged as a prominent legal matter a few decades ago, specifically in the 1990s. U.S. federal regulators initiated legal action against the company in response to its escalating market dominance in the personal computer market. \nThe Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation to ascertain whether Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was engaging in monopolistic practices aimed at controlling the personal computer market. Although the initial investigation concluded without charges, the U.S. Department of Justice revived the case in 1998. \nThe Justice Department filed antitrust charges against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), alleging that the company's bundling of additional programs into its operating system was anti-competitive. This practice effectively required consumers to purchase the Windows operating system to access certain applications. \nIn a move towards increased regulation, The White House collaborated with CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to promote the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act -- a Health and Human Services Department initiative. \nAmong its provisions, the act includes measures to cap insulin prices, expand access to adult vaccines, and empower Medicare, the US health program for the elderly, to negotiate prices of expensive drugs manufactured by major pharmaceutical companies. During their joint effort, the coalition emphasized the importance of educating consumers about the new Medicare prescription drug benefits and discussed strategies for pharmacies to assist individuals with filling out forms during Medicaid coverage renewal processes. \nThe leaders from CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) delved into programs like Extra Help, designed to support low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities in managing premium and medication costs.\nPixabay/Public Domain\nTo determine the 7 Command Economy Countries and 7 Others with Big Government Presence, we used two metrics as major indicators: the 2024 Index of Economic Freedom from The Heritage Foundation, (which measures economic freedom on a scale of 1-100 of scores) and the GDP of the respective countries from World Bank Data. A lower Index of Economic Freedom score suggests that an economy has less economic freedom and a bigger government presence. We have combined these factors with the size of GDPs, and the degree of socialist policies implemented in the countries and based on that, we present the list of 14 most economically regulated countries in the world.\nHere is our list of 7 Command Economy Countries and 7 Others with Big Government Presence.\nThe regulatory environment of Burundi is characterized by a mix of legislation and institutions aimed at governing various sectors of the economy and society. The country's legal framework encompasses laws and regulations pertaining to finance, trade, labor, environment, and governance.\nCongo has undertaken initiatives with limited efficacy to promote responsible business conduct (RBC), urging companies to establish and uphold codes of ethics while emphasizing environmental responsibility. The Labor Code incorporates safeguards for employees, and legal mandates exist to compel businesses to safeguard the environment. Nevertheless, the country lacks a comprehensive legal structure to protect consumer rights, and domestic laws to shield individuals from detrimental business practices are absent.\nSince 2018, Ethiopia has experienced significant holistic policy and legislative transformations. As part of this process, numerous laws aimed at facilitating business operations have been introduced. Notably, the Ethiopian Government enacted the Capital Markets Proclamation, establishing a domestic capital market with the explicit goal of advancing the national economy through capital mobilization, fostering financial innovation, and distributing investment risks.\nBusinesses contemplating entry into the Sudanese market encounter significant uncertainty attributed to political upheaval, corruption, an ineffective bureaucracy with limited capabilities, a fluctuating regulatory landscape, and challenges within the financial sector. The existing government faces legitimacy issues, compounded by political instability that has led many local companies to postpone their investment initiatives. \nTo boost dwindling government revenues following the military takeover in 2021, the administration has raised the business tax to 30% in 2022 and escalated fees on the private sector.\nThe 2009 constitution of Bolivia mandated the nationalization of enterprises in \"strategic\" sectors, encompassing industries such as fossil fuels, mining, telecommunications, and electricity. Under the leadership of President Luis Arce and the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) government, there has been a strong inclination toward nationalization and an economic model centered on import substitution.\nIn recent years, China is experiencing decelerating growth and a progressively restrictive regulatory landscape. While the emergence of COVID-19 undoubtedly played a significant role in this slowdown, unexpected regulatory measures implemented by policymakers have further complicated the business environment, affecting market sentiment overall.\nIn Turkmenistan, the absence of a well-defined rule of law, an unclear regulatory structure, and widespread corruption continue to pose significant challenges. Contracts frequently go to companies closely connected to the President's family. Moreover, the government maintains strict control over foreign exchange movements, imposing limitations on currency conversion that hinder the repatriation of profits or payments to foreign suppliers.\nThe recurring practice of implementing ad hoc trade restrictions, including exchange controls and local content policies, to shield inefficient domestic producers creates a challenging environment for Zimbabwe's private sector. \nThe government's frequent policy shifts, often applied inconsistently and influenced by political or personal considerations, pose significant obstacles to business planning. Zimbabwe's regulatory landscape remains intricate, with businesses encountering difficulties registering and operating within the country.\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) continues to be regarded as one of the most oppressive nations globally. Under the authoritarian rule of Kim Jong Un, the government responded to international pressures and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 by further isolating itself and intensifying repression. Fearful obedience among the populace is enforced through threats of execution, imprisonment, enforced disappearances, and forced labor in detention and prison camps.\nClick to continue reading and see the Top 5 Command-Economy Countries in the World.\nSuggested Articles: \n25 Countries with Most Gold Reserves in 2024\n25 Companies with the Best Benefits and Perks\n20 Countries That Read the Most in the World\nDisclosure.

        "article_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks tumbled Tuesday to their worst day since an early August sell-off, as a week full of updates on the economy got off to a discouragingly weak start.\nThe S&P 500 sank 2.1% to give back a chunk of the gains from a three-week winning streak that had carried it to the cusp of its all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 626 points, or 1.5%, from its own record set on Friday before Monday’s Labor Day holiday. The Nasdaq composite fell 3.3% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks led the way lower.\nTreasury yields also stumbled in the bond market after a report showed U.S. manufacturing shrank again in August, sputtering under the weight of high interest rates. Manufacturing has been contracting for most of the past two years, and its performance for August was worse than economists expected.\n“Demand remains subdued, as companies show an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current federal monetary policy and election uncertainty,” said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing business survey committee.\nStocks of oil and gas companies were some of the market’s biggest losers after the price of crude oil fell roughly 4% on concerns about how much fuel a fragile global economy will burn. A barrel of benchmark U.S. oil is almost back to $70 and down for the year after climbing above $85 in April.\nExxon Mobil lost 2.1%, and ConocoPhillips dropped 3.5%.\nSimilar worries about a slowing U.S. economy and a possible recession had helped send stocks on a scary summertime swoon in early August. It briefly knocked the S&P 500 nearly 10% below its record set in July, but financial markets quickly rebounded on hopes that the Federal Reserve could pull off a perfect landing for the economy.\nThe Fed appears set to lower interest rates later this month in hopes of easing conditions for the economy and avoiding a recession after earlier jacking its main interest rate to a two-decade high to beat high inflation.\nOther reports due later this week could show how much help the economy needs, including updates on the number of job openings U.S. employers were advertising at the end of July and how strong U.S. services businesses grew last month. The week’s highlight will likely arrive on Friday, when a report will show how many jobs U.S. employers created during August.\nThe jobs report has once again become the main event for the stock market each month, taking over from updates on inflation, according to analysts at Bank of America. Many traders are anticipating the Fed will deliver a full percentage point of cuts to interest rates this year, which is a “recession-sized” amount, Gonzalo Asis and other economists and strategists wrote in a BofA Global Research report.\nThe strength of this jobs report, or lack thereof, will likely determine the size of the Fed’s upcoming cut, according to Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle. If Friday’s data shows an improvement in hiring over July’s disappointing report, it could keep the Fed on course for a traditional-sized move of a quarter of a percentage point.\nBut if Friday’s report is weaker, it could drive the Fed to deliver an outsized cut of half a percentage point from the federal funds rate’s current range of 5.25% to 5.50%, Mericle said.\nWhile cuts to rates are generally boons to investment prices, a recession could more than wipe out that benefit by dragging down corporate profits.\nOn Wall Street, U.S. Steel fell 6.1% in its first trading after Vice President Kamala Harris said Monday that she opposed the company’s planned sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel. The Democratic presidential nominee’s comments, which echo President Joe Biden’s position, came after Nippon Steel Corp. said last week it would spend an additional $1.3 billion to upgrade facilities in Pennsylvania and Indiana, on top of a previous $1.4 billion commitment.\nNippon Steel also reiterated that it expects the transaction to close by the end of this year, despite ongoing political and labor opposition.\nNvidia was the heaviest weight by far on the S&P 500 after falling 9.5%. Its stock has been struggling even after the chip company topped high expectations for its latest profit report. The subdued performance could bolster criticism that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks simply soared too high in Wall Street’s frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.\nAll of the stocks that have come to be known as the “Magnificent Seven,” which accounted for the vast majority of the S&P 500’s return last year and early this year, fell at least 1.3%.\nStill, it wasn’t a complete washout on Wall Street. Nearly 30% of the stocks within the S&P 500 climbed, led by those that tend to benefit the most from lower interest rates. That includes dividend-paying stocks, as well as companies whose profits are less closely tied to the ebbs and flows of the economy, such as real-estate stocks and makers of everyday staples for consumers.\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 119.47 points to 5,528.93. The Dow dropped 626.15 to 40,936.93, and the Nasdaq composite sank 577.33 to 17,136.30.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.84% from 3.91% late Friday. That’s down from 4.70% in late April, a significant move for the bond market.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were lower across much of Europe and Asia.\nWorries were also growing about the resilience of China’s economy, as recently disclosed data showed a mixed picture. Weak earnings reports from Chinese companies, including property developer and investor New World Development Co., added to the pessimism.\n___\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."

        "date": "2024-06-02T16:30:08.000Z",
        "article_content": "The Russian gas giant Gazprom was a money machine for the last two decades, enriching many insiders and helping keep Vladimir Putin’s government flush. But that run has ended, with Gazprom recently announcing it lost $6.9 billion in 2023, mainly because of Russia’s war in Ukraine and sanctions that have punctured Gazprom’s sales.\nLike Gazprom, the whole Russian economy is beginning to crack under the twin strains of enormous wartime spending and withering sanctions. Since invading Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has held up better than many Westerners expected or hoped. That has been mainly due to skillful central bank management of the economy and robust oil and gas revenue.\nBut US-led sanctions, imperfect as they are, are slowly strangling Russia’s economy, and the Biden administration is hinting at more to come. Russia’s war production may be peaking now, with equipment shortages, possibly dire ones, looming in 2025 and beyond.\n“The Soviet Union was a war machine, and it ran out of steam,” Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution, said at a May 28 Brookings conference. “This will, as well, eventually run into considerable consequences. Putin wants us all to think he can’t be defeated. He knows he can be. And he is genuinely worried at this particular moment.”\nThe biggest news regarding Russia’s war in Ukraine this year has been the precarious condition of Ukraine’s frontline troops, who have been outgunned, outmanned, and slowly losing territory. A six-month delay in vital US military aid, combined with manpower shortfalls and other problems, has allowed Russia to exploit weaknesses, pound Ukrainian infrastructure with bombs and missiles, and threaten Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city.\nBut Russia is on borrowed time too, and the real test may be whether its economy can hold up long enough to exhaust the Ukrainians and their sometimes flaky allies.\nOn the surface, Russia’s economy looks OK, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting 3.2% GDP growth this year. That’s better than the 2.7% GDP growth forecast for the United States.\nBut some analysts think the GDP outlook masks so many underlying problems that it’s almost meaningless. Putin “still has some ability to finance the war, but this is running out very fast,” Vladimir Milov, a Russian economist who led some reforms in the late 1990s and has since left Russia, said in a recent podcast for the UK’s Royal United Services Institute. “The signs that sanctions are working are there, but it really takes more time. Putin’s economy is a big beast. It takes time to strangle.”\nAmong Russia’s problems: Its national wealth fund, a pool of reserves Putin taps to finance the war, has dropped from $113 billion before the war to about $56 billion now. Not all of the $56 billion is liquid, and Russia needs to keep some money on hand for a genuine emergency.\n“Their reserves are fast depleting,” Agathe Demarais of the European Council on Foreign Relations said at the May 28 Brookings event. Gazprom’s losses, she said, are “going to be a problem for replenishing the reserves. We’re talking about really big numbers. I don’t think there will be an easy way out for Russia.”\nAnalysts think Gazprom will continue losing money through at least 2025, mainly because European nations that used to be the firm’s biggest customers have weaned themselves off Russian energy. The easiest way to transport gas is by pipeline, and while other countries buy Russian gas, they’re not connected by pipes.\nOil is easier to transport, and oil revenue continues to provide Russia with desperately needed cash. Yet it’s also more expensive for Russia to ship oil to Asian buyers that have replaced Europeans, causing another crunch.\nSanctions, meanwhile, have weakened the value of the ruble and pushed up the cost of goods, especially imports. Russia’s central bank has tried to offset those problems by raising interest rates, with short-term rates currently set at 16%.\nYet difficulties persist. Russia’s official inflation rate is an uncomfortable 7.8%, and the Russian research firm Romir reports that overall price levels for common consumer goods have nearly doubled since the 2022 invasion. Vegetables, as one example, have shot up in price because of sanctions on Western supplies of seeds, fertilizer, and other staples of agricultural production.\nTo plug some of the holes, Putin is planning tax hikes on businesses and the wealthy, but that could backfire. Foreign investment in Russia has plummeted, and most businesses can’t afford loans at double-digit interest rates. So the only source of investment is companies' own profits, which new taxes will take a bigger bite out of, discouraging investment. The whole cycle is a recipe for collapsing output, similar to what caused the dissolution of the USSR in the late 1980s.\nChina is helping in ways by selling Russia many of the products Western sanctions seek to limit. But China is exploiting Russia’s weakness more than helping it regain its economic footing, according to a recent paper Milov wrote for the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies in Brussels.\nChinese suppliers are marking up the prices of cars, electronics, industrial products, and just about everything else Russia needs, in some cases charging even more than the American and European suppliers they’re replacing. That’s contributing to Russian inflation.\nWhen buying Russian oil and gas, China demands discounts ranging from 20% to 50% off the market price. At the same time, there’s barely any new Chinese investment in Russia or any sign China is taking long-term economic risks for Russia’s sake.\n“Russia is learning the hard way that China is not interested in being Russia’s donor,” the Milov report says. “China is only interested in Russia economically as a supplier of cheap raw materials with sizeable discounts, as a market for Chinese finished products sold at a premium, and not interested in investing in seeing Russia emerging as a competitor at international markets of manufactured goods.”\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nSanctions were never meant to unilaterally end Russia’s barbarity in Ukraine, and nobody thinks they will now. What they are meant to do is raise the price Russia pays for invading a peaceful neighbor and perhaps contribute to an outcome that looks something like a win for Ukraine.\nUkraine is not close to winning, and much depends on future events, starting with this year’s US presidential election. If Donald Trump wins, he’s likely to ease the pressure on Putin, whom he has publicly admired, possibly opening the door to a Russian victory. If Biden wins, however, a more aggressive effort to defeat Putin is possible.\nThe Biden administration has given Ukraine increasingly sophisticated weapons and has now changed its policy to allow Ukraine to use some of them to strike military targets inside Russia, which has been a taboo up till now.\nCongress recently passed a law allowing the US government to seize around $6 billion worth of Russian assets in the United States and give them to Ukraine. The Biden administration is trying to do persuade European nations to do the same with up to $300 billion of Russian assets parked there.\nAnother big step Biden could take would be lowering the price cap on Russian oil sales — currently $60 per barrel — and better enforcing it. Russia has found a variety of ways to evade the cap and has been selling oil for more when market conditions allow. Biden, for his part, has been reluctant to impose any sanctions on Russia that could raise prices in global markets and, crucially during an election year, at home.\nThat could change if Biden wins a second term, which would definitely be a disappointment to Putin, who’s hoping for friendlier governments in Washington and other capitals. If not running for reelection, Biden would be freer to make decisions he deems necessary, even if they’re not popular. There could be a lot more of those before Russia’s Ukraine war is over.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-09-15T20:37:22.000Z",
        "article_content": "Many Americans have fond memories of the Trump economy that ran from 2017 to 2021. Inflation, interest rates, and gasoline prices were low; the stock market did well; and pre-COVID job and economic growth were solid.\nThe old Trump economy is a factor in the 2024 election, given that voters trust Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, more on the economy than they trust his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. And as usual, the economy is a top voter concern.\nBut if Trump wins a second term, anybody expecting a quick return to the Goldilocks economy of his first term is likely to be very disappointed. In a preview of Trump 2.0, Goldman Sachs estimated that the economy would shrink by half a percentage point during Trump’s first year if he imposed all of his policies, including new tariffs on imports and a business tax cut that pushed annual deficits higher. Harris’s plan, by contrast, would modestly boost GDP growth, according to Goldman.\nDuring his first term, Trump benefited from benign economic trends dating all the way back to the Great Recession of 2008 and the slow but steady recovery that followed. The post-COVID economy is a different animal with stronger inflationary pressures, more protectionism, costlier energy, and more global turmoil likely to produce shocks. Those forces will dominate the economy during the next four years no matter who is the US president.\nMany voters blame or credit the president for whatever happens on their watch. But market forces drive the economy, and presidents normally have only a marginal effect. Looking at four key indicators — inflation, interest rates, gasoline prices, and GDP growth — shows that the trends under Trump were largely the same as those under his predecessor, Barack Obama. The COVID disruptions that began in 2020 changed the trajectory for all four of those metrics, as the following chart shows.\nA surge in prices since 2021 has been Biden’s biggest economic vulnerability. But Trump didn’t do anything special to keep inflation low. Except for occasional spikes in energy prices, there was no meaningful inflation from 1990 to 2021. The Federal Reserve was more concerned about deflation, given that overall price levels briefly went negative under Obama in 2015, as the chart above shows.\nOne huge factor keeping inflation contained for most of the last 30 years was globalization and a surge in cheap imports from China, in particular. Trump’s trade wars during his first term, when he slapped tariffs on imports, began to close the door on cheap imports. Biden kept those tariffs in place, and both Democrats and Republicans now back a tougher line on China and a renewed emphasis on boosting domestic manufacturing.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nThat could be good for the US economy overall, but stuff made in the USA is almost always more expensive due to higher pay and more stringent safety and environmental rules. There’s less of a built-in hedge against inflation now than there was during the peak days of globalization, which might have been around 2010 or 2015. That's not likely to change, and those cost pressures will put a higher floor under prices for many things.\nDuring the Great Recession in 2008, the Federal Reserve slashed short-term rates to 0, the first time it had ever gone that low. That was shock therapy meant to jolt the economy back to life amid a financial panic and near depression. The Fed raised rates a bit from 2015 through 2019, but the lack of inflation allowed it to go slow — then slash rates to 0 again when COVID arrived in 2020.\nConsumers got used to super-low interest rates, but the whole period from 2009 through 2021 was abnormal. From 1990 through 2008, the Fed's short-term rate averaged 4.25%. From 2009 to 2021, the average was 0.52%.\nConsumer rates followed the same pattern. From 1990 through 2008, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 7.3%. From 2009 through 2021, it was 4%. Even now, mortgage rates around 6.4% are below the historical norm. With the Fed poised to cut rates soon, consumer rates could drift down a bit. But stronger inflationary pressure than in the past will probably prevent the Fed from cutting to anywhere near the levels during the decade after the Great Recession.\nDuring Trump’s term, gas prices averaged $2.57, compared with $3.60 so far under Biden. Even adjusted for inflation, gas prices were cheaper under Trump. But Trump didn’t do anything to lower pump prices, even though he’s a fossil fuel lover whose mantra is “drill, baby, drill.” Trump simply came into office as the fracking boom was near peak production and energy providers all around the world were overproducing.\nIn terms of profitability, energy was the worst-performing sector during the Trump presidency because drillers were foregoing profits to gain market share. OPEC joined that game, adding to overproduction, which pushed prices to unusually low levels. When COVID hit in 2020, energy profits collapsed along with retail prices, and the whole industry went through a shakeout.\nThe result is that energy firms and their investors now prioritize profitability and “capital discipline” over market share — no matter who’s the president. “Our energy team believes that it is unlikely that a Trump administration would translate into more actual drilling relative to a Harris administration,” investing firm Raymond James concluded in a Sept. 10 analysis of possible election outcomes. “A push to decrease the price of US energy could potentially disincentivize production from domestic oil and gas names.” Energy firms, in short, got burned during Trump's presidency, and they're not going to do that again.\nTrump wants people to believe he presided over the “best economy in the history of our country,” but it was really about the same as during Obama’s second term. Under Obama, from 2013 through 2016, real GDP growth averaged 2.5% per quarter. Under Trump, during the three years before COVID hit, it averaged 2.8%. Including COVID, GDP growth under Trump averaged 2.4%.\nGrowth under Biden has been stronger, averaging 3% per quarter. But higher inflation and interest rates have more than offset that in voters’ minds. Inflation peaked at 9% in 2022, and while it’s almost back to normal, Americans still feel stung by three years of a hot economy in which cheap imports and plentiful energy no longer cushioned shocks the way they used to. This year’s presidential election isn’t likely to change that.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-12-16T06:11:37.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Kevin Yao, Joe Cash and Ethan Wang\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China's industrial output growth quickened slightly in November, while retail sales disappointed, keeping alive calls for Beijing to ramp up consumer-focused stimulus as policymakers brace for more U.S. trade tariffs under a second Trump administration.\nThe mixed data underline how challenging it will be for China's leaders to mount a durable economic recovery heading into 2025, when trade relations with China's biggest export market could worsen while domestic consumption also stays weak.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump's vow to impose tariffs exceeding 60% on Chinese goods could push Beijing to accelerate plans to rebalance its $19 trillion economy, analysts said. This comes after over two decades of deliberation on transitioning from the current growth model focused on fixed-asset investment and exports to a consumption-driven one.\nChina's industrial output in November grew 5.4% from a year earlier, faster than the 5.3% pace seen in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday, beating expectations for a 5.3% increase in a Reuters poll.\nHowever, retail sales, a gauge of consumption, grew at its weakest pace in three months at 3.0% last month, much slower than a 4.8% rise seen in October. Analysts had predicted a 4.6% expansion.\n\"China's economic policies have been amazingly consistent in promoting manufacturers over consumers despite clear signs of lasting weakness,\" said Dan Wang, a Shanghai-based independent economist.\n\"So, one can expect production capacity to strengthen, potentially agitating the overcapacity issue and motivating Chinese companies to seek overseas markets.\"\nFixed asset investment also increased at a slower 3.3% pace in January-November from the same period a year earlier, compared with an expected 3.4% rise. It grew 3.4% in the January to October period.\n\"Worries about the poor retail sales may be overdone, as it results from an early start of the 'Double 11' shopping festival which frontloaded sales to October,\" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\"If we smooth the October-November data, then growth should average around 3.9%, which is higher than the previous months,\" he added. \"But consumer demand is not strong in itself, it is still very reliant on government subsidies, which contributed about 1.5-2 percentage points to monthly retail sales.\"\nChina's blue chip index dropped 0.37% in early afternoon and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.57%.\nPOLICY SUPPORT PLEDGES\nPolicymakers have begun voicing their plans for 2025 in recent weeks, well aware of the fact that Trump's return to the White House will place considerable strain on an already ailing economy.\nOver the weekend, an official at China's central bank said it had room to further cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, but credit numbers out last week showed past easing had done little to boost borrowing.\nThat is partly because policymakers have yet to find a fix to a years-long property crisis that is dragging on consumer confidence, with some 70% of household savings parked in real estate.\nAnd while there was some encouraging signs in China's new home prices, which fell at the slowest pace in 17 months in November, it remains too early to call a recovery, analysts say.\nStabilising the property sector, which at its peak constituted 25% of the economy, will be key if Beijing is to maintain a growth target of around 5% for next year, which Reuters has reported that policy advisers have recommended.\nA recent Reuters poll predicted China will grow 4.5% next year, with new U.S. tariffs potentially shaving up to 1 parentage point off growth.\nOn Monday, Moody's Ratings raised China's GDP growth forecast to 4.2% from 4% for 2025.\nAt last week's Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), a closely-watched agenda-setting meeting, China's top leaders pledged to raise the budget deficit, issue more debt, and make boosting consumption a top priority.\nThe remarks echoed commitments made by a meeting of top Communist Party officials, the Politburo, earlier this month, which endorsed an \"appropriately loose\" monetary policy in the first easing of its stance in 14 years.\n\"We think the deleration in November will probably prove temporary, with growth likely to pick up again over the coming months as policy support continues to be stepped up,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics.\n\"But we doubt that stimulus can deliver anything more than a short-lived improvement, not least because the current strength of export demand is unlikely to last once President Trump starts to put some of his tariff threats into action.\"\n(Reporting by Kevin Yao, Joe Cash and Ethan Wang; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Jacqueline Wong)"

        "article_content": "The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.1% from July through September, driven by strong consumer spending and increased exports, according to the Commerce Department’s revised estimate. This marks an acceleration from 3.0% growth in the second quarter, despite high interest rates.\nConsumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a robust 3.7% annual rate in the third quarter. This was an improvement from the previous estimate of 3.5% and the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2023.\nExports jumped 9.6%, contributing significantly to growth. Business investment saw a modest 0.8% increase overall though investment in equipment rose sharply by 10.8%. Federal government spending jumped by 8.9%, including a noteworthy 13.9% rise in defense expenditures.\nThe Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose at a modest 1.5% annual rate in Q3, down from 2.5% in the previous quarter. Core PCE inflation, which bars food and energy prices, increased by 2.2%, a decline from the 2.8% rate in the April-June quarter.\nRBC Capital Markets expects 2% to 3% U.S. economic growth in 2025. Bank of America's equity and quantitative strategy team projects the U.S. economy to grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than the Bloomberg consensus forecast of 2.1% growth, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that could gain in light of U.S. economic growth.\niShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)\nCurrently, the U.S. economy remains strong, with inflation showing a cooling trend and earnings continuing to grow. The U.S. dollar remains strong. A strong dollar provides an edge to domestic-focused companies as small caps do not have much exposure to the international market. Plus, Trump’s “America First” agenda should also continue to favor small-cap stocks. Small-cap ETF Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) IWM is a good pick here.\nSPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT)\nA measure of the economy’s underlying strength — including consumer spending and private investment while excluding volatile items like exports and government spending — grew at a solid 3.4% annual rate in Q3, up from 2.7% in the second quarter. Upbeat consumer spending is a plus for retail ETFs like XRT. The XRT ETF has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) (read: 5 ETFs for Smart Holiday Season Investing).\nSPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (SPYD)\nPer several analysts, value stocks tend to outperform in periods of stronger GDP growth. Plus, the second Trump era and protectionist policies may drive up inflation in 2025. This scenario is likely to keep bond yields higher (read: Will Strong GDP Growth Drive Value ETFs in 2025?).\nValue stocks have strong current cash flows that are more likely to grow slowly or diminish over time. Therefore, when valuing stocks using the discounted cash flow method, in times of higher interest rates, value stocks are less negatively impacted than growth stocks. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ETF SPYD yields 3.04% annually.\niShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT)\nPer RBC Capital’s Calvasina work, when GDP growth ranged between 2.1% and 3%, stocks gained 70% of the time, with an average return of nearly 11%, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. This puts focus on the all-cap blend ETFs like ITOT. The ETF has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "date": "2024-04-24T15:49:15.000Z",
        "article_content": "As the week unfolds, investors are eagerly awaiting the impending release of the U.S. gross domestic product growth rate for the first quarter of 2024, set for this Thursday, ahead of the highly anticipated Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index report – the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge – on Friday. \nThe U.S. economy showed a robust 3.4% growth rate in the last quarter of 2023, following another spectacular 4.9% growth in the third quarter, according to the final estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nWall Street analysts are forecasting a deceleration in growth, with expectations set around a 2.5% increase in GDP, adjusted annually, from the previous quarter. “That would be the seventh consecutive solid reading for real GDP. That certainly isn’t a hard landing and hardly a soft one,” veteran investor Ed Yardeni commented in a note.\nAmong key GDP components, real consumer spending is predicted to advance at a 2.8% pace in Q1 2024, slowing down from the 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecasts a 2.9% surge. The model suggests that real personal consumption expenditures and first-quarter real gross private domestic investment are expected to grow at 3.4% and 3.7%, respectively.\nThe GDP price index is expected to show a 3% quarter-on-quarter annualized surge, marking an acceleration compared to the 1.7% recorded in Q4 2023.\nRead also: ‘We’re Buying This Soft Landing’: Former Fed Governor Blames Government Spending For Delaying Rate Cuts\nChart: Could The US Economy Continue To Defy Soft-Landing Scenarios?\nGoldman Sachs economist Spencer Hill presents a more optimistic view, projecting a 3.1% growth rate. This forecast exceeds the consensus by 0.6 percentage points and edges out the Atlanta Fed's expectations by 0.2 points. Key factors underpinning this upbeat forecast include:\nA significant 13% quarterly annualized increase in residential investment, fueled by lower mortgage rates, spurring sales and construction.\nA robust recovery in auto production, contributing an additional 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth.\nA resurgence in manufacturing, likely to enhance capital expenditures on equipment and structures.\nContinued strong consumer spending, supported by significant upward revisions to March retail sales data that the consensus may have underestimated.\nLooking beyond the first quarter, Goldman Sachs anticipates a slight deceleration in economic growth.\nThe forecast suggests a 2.4% expansion in Q2, with an average growth rate of 2.5% for the second half of the year.\nThis outlook is supported by high levels of immigration, robust real personal income growth, and a modest uplift from financial conditions.\nA stronger-than-expected Q1 GDP result may reinforce the perception of a resilient U.S. economy capable of withstanding high interest rates, potentially keeping the Federal Reserve focused on controlling inflation.\nThis could positively impact the U.S. dollar, while possibly leading to downward pressure on bonds and rate-sensitive sectors like real estate and technology.\nConversely, a GDP figure below expectations might prompt closer examination of how inflationary pressures are impacting consumer spending.

        "article_content": "The US labor market added far fewer jobs than expected in October as weather disruptions and worker strikes weighed on the labor market.\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the labor market added 12,000 payrolls in October, less than the 100,000 expected by economists.\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, partly due to a difference in how the BLS collects data for that metric versus monthly job additions. Workers who were employed but earned no money wouldn't be counted as unemployed in the household survey, which is where the unemployment rate comes from. They would not be considered employed in the payroll survey, which is how job additions are tabulated.\nOctober job additions came in far lower than the revised 223,000 added in September. Monthly job additions for August and September were also revised lower by a combined 112,000.\n\"Ignore that top line [job additions], look at that 4.1%, and just get on with it,\" Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM, told Yahoo Finance. He added, \"This is all noise.\"\nEconomists warned ahead of Friday's release that recent hurricanes and a strike by Boeing (BA) workers weigh on the labor market data for October. The BLS confirmed that was the case in Friday's release.\n\"It is likely that payroll employment estimates in some industries were affected by the hurricanes,\" the BLS wrote in the release. \"However, it is not possible to quantify the net effect on the over-the-month change in national employment, hours, or earnings estimates because the establishment survey is not designed to isolate effects from extreme weather events. There was no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate from the household survey.\"\nThe BLS added that manufacturing jobs declined by 46,000 in October \"largely due to strike activity.\"\nElsewhere in Friday's report, wage growth, an important measure for gauging inflation pressures, rose to 4.1% year-over-year from a 4% annual gain in September. On a monthly basis, wages increased 0.4%, compared to a 0.3% gain in September. Additionally, labor force participation fell to 62.6% from 62.7%.\nThe report is the last major economic release before the Federal Reserve's next policy decision on Nov. 7. Market expectations for that meeting moved little after the jobs report. As of Friday morning, markets were pricing in a roughly 99% chance that the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 25 basis points next week, up from a 95% chance seen a week ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool. \nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nBroadly, recent data outside the monthly employment report has shown a labor market that's gradually cooling. Data out Tuesday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed job openings fell to their lowest level since January 2021 during the month of September. Meanwhile, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% in September, down from a revised 2% in August. This marked the lowest quits rate since June 2020.\n“The big picture is that the labor market continues to cool down (even beyond hurricane effects), and this should keep the Fed on pace for rate cuts in November and December,\" Carson Group global macro strategist Sonu Varghese wrote in a note on Friday.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Americans’ attitudes toward the economy improved this month for the first time since January, thanks to better perceptions of the job market.\nThe Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index for this month climbed to a reading of 102, up from 97.5 in April. Americans of all age groups felt better about the economy, the survey noted. That’s after consumer confidence declined in each of the prior three months.\n“Consumers’ assessment of current business conditions was slightly less positive than last month. However, the strong labor market continued to bolster consumers’ overall assessment of the present situation,” Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, said in a release.\nCompared to the University of Michigan’s consumer survey, the Conference Board survey puts more weight on perceptions of the job market. Unemployment remains below 4%, job openings still exceed the number of unemployed people seeking work and employers are still pumping out jobs at a brisk pace.\nBut elevated inflation still looms large. That’s precisely why consumer confidence declined for three straight months prior to May, when inflation readings came in hotter than expected. The April survey showed that “consumers cited prices, especially for food and groceries, as having the greatest impact on their view of the US economy,” Peterson said.\nThe survey also showed that respondents felt more upbeat about the stock market, with “48.2% expecting stock prices to increase over the year ahead, compared to 25.4% expecting a decrease and 26.4% expecting no change.”\nMajor stock indexes have soared to record highs recently, with the Nasdaq Composite briefly breaking above 17,000 in intraday trading Tuesday.\nSeparately on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released survey data on consumer expectations for a wide array of public policies, such as taxes, unemployment benefits and housing assistance.\nThe survey, conducted in April, found that a higher share of Americans saw improved prospects for an increase in the federal minimum wage as well as higher welfare and unemployment benefits. Additionally, respondents’ expectations increased for expansions in federal student aid as well as student loan forgiveness.\nHowever, in a time when home prices are setting new highs, the survey also showed that pessimism heightened about increases in housing assistance and affordable housing.The average likelihood of reduced housing assistance increased to 15%, the highest reading since December 2019, New York Fed data shows.\nStill, consumers were more optimistic about tax benefits for homeowners. The average likelihood for a higher mortgage interest tax deduction climbed to 24.8% — the highest ever reading for this New York Fed series, which was started in November 2015.\nThis story has been updated with additional context and details.\nCNN’s Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

        "title": "The 'Pet Economy' Boom: Americans Are Spending Big and Going All-in for Their Pets",
        "date": "2024-11-11T14:00:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "The Harris Poll Survey Reveals the Rising Costs and Commitments of Modern Pet Parenthood\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / November 11, 2024 / A new study by The Harris Poll reveals a burgeoning trend in American pet ownership, marking the rise of the \"Pet Economy.\" As pet owners increasingly treat their pets as integral family members, they are committing substantial financial resources, driving the emergence of \"pet debt\" as a new norm. On average, American pet owners spend $4,366 annually on their pets. Gen Z leads the charge, spending $6,103 annually, followed by Millennials at $5,150, Gen X at $3,878, and Boomers at $2,454.\nIf given the choice, 43% of Americans say they'd opt for pets over children in the future. For younger generations like Gen Z and Millennials, pets are seen as more manageable-43% say they're easier to care for, and 42% believe they come with less financial burden.\n\"Pet owners are no longer just buying kibble-they're building a lifestyle around their pets,\" says Libby Rodney, Chief Strategy Officer and Futurist at The Harris Poll. \"From commissioning custom portraits to creating pet-only spaces in their homes, this new wave of ‘All-in Pawrenting' shows how deeply integrated pets have become in every aspect of their owners' lives.\"\nFrom Emotional Support to Financial Commitment: The Cost of Pet Parenthood\nPet ownership has transcended traditional boundaries, evolving into a significant financial undertaking. With 82% of pet owners viewing their pets as their own children, their commitment extends well beyond emotional support. On average, pet owners are spending $4,366 per year on their pets, with Gen Z leading the charge at $6,103 annually. This trend is creating a new financial phenomenon known as \"pet debt,\" where the costs associated with caring for pets are comparable to those of raising children.\nA striking 34% of Millennial pet parents and 29% of Gen Z pet owners admit their devotion to their pets has led to financial strain, with some willing to accrue debt for their pets' well-being. The study found that 67% of pet owners would sacrifice alcohol for a year for one more year with their pets, and a third would part with $100,000 for additional time with their pets. Furthermore, 47% of pet owners would even leave their pets an inheritance if they could, underscoring the depth of their financial commitment.\nPet Owners Are Calling for Pet-Friendly Workplaces, Spaces, and Luxury Services\nThe desire for pet-friendly environments and specialized services is on the rise, with pet owners calling for changes not just in public spaces, but also in the workplace. Over half of American pet owners (58%) believe their employers should normalize allowing pets at work, and nearly half (49%) feel their paychecks should include a stipend to cover pet-related expenses. Additionally, 46% think employers should offer leave for getting new pets, underscoring the growing importance of pets in their personal and professional lives.\nIn public spaces, eight in 10 pet owners (80%) advocate for more pet-friendly shops and establishments, while 75% wish for greater access to pet-inclusive areas. Nearly six in 10 (58%) say they'd love more opportunities to bring their pets along on plane rides.\nThe growing market for premium pet products and services reflects this trend. Over half of pet owners are interested in items such as GPS collars, monthly pet subscription boxes, specialized cameras, and pet-centric events. Among the \"All-in Pawrents,\" 87% are calling for more pet-first spaces in their communities, reinforcing that this is not a fleeting trend but a significant and lasting demand for integration.\n\"Pawternity\" is Here to Stay: Redefining Modern Pet Parenthood\nThe emergence of \"All-in Pawrents\" demonstrates a growing desire for a new kind of parental recognition. Over a third (38%) would give up $100,000 for another year with their pet, and nearly two-thirds (65%) would forgo three years of vacations. Beyond this, 77% are interested in 24/7 on-call veterinary services, and 70% are keen on treatments that could extend their pets' lives.\n\"‘All-in Pawrenting' is not just a catchy term; it reflects a fundamental change in how Americans view family,\" adds Rodney. \"These pet parents are rewriting the rules, prioritizing their pets in ways that demand societal adaptation and respect. From pet-specific insurance to ‘pawternity leave,' it's clear that our love for our pets is shaping the future.\"\nAbout the survey\nThis custom survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll between May 24 to 26, among comprising of 1,594 pet owners aged 18 and over. Additionally, this research comprises of 738 \"All-in Pawrents,\" who are pet owners that responded, \"Strongly Agree\" when asked to respond to the statement \"My pet(s) is/are like my own child.\" You can view the full report here.\nAbout Harris Poll Thought Leadership Practice\nBuilding on 60+ years of experience pulsing societal opinion, we design research that is credible, creative, and culturally relevant.

        "date": "2024-12-04T11:42:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "In September, the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle. However, that hasn’t discouraged investors from pouring money into U.S. money-market funds.\nAccredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\nAccording to Bloomberg, the assets under management in these mutual funds crossed a record $7 trillion last month. So they’re clearly still pretty popular despite the fact that they will deliver lower returns as interest rates are cut.\nIf you're feeling skittish about the economy in the wake of the recent election, you're probably not alone. You may gain some financial security by putting your cash into a money market fund. But you should know that there are some drawbacks to consider, too.\nSome people use the terms money market fund and money market account interchangeably. That's a mistake, since they're not the same thing.\nA money market account combines the features of a savings and checking account so you're able to earn a return on your money while also writing checks and taking cash withdrawals against your balance. Money market accounts get to enjoy FDIC protection of up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.\nA money-market fund (MMF), meanwhile, is a type of ultra low-risk mutual fund that doesn't come with FDIC protection. MMFs consist of relatively safe assets like short-term debt securities. So technically, you can lose money in an MMF, whereas you can't lose money in an FDIC-insured money market account provided your balance is $250,000 or less.\nIt may seem curious that investors are flocking to MMFs at this time. One possible reason is that they aren't expecting interest rates to come down significantly in the near future.\n\"Few people seriously expect a return to ZIRP (zero interest rate policy). Indeed, since the Fed started easing in September, markets have begun pricing in fewer cuts and the implied terminal rate has risen by around a full percentage point, and MMF inflows have accelerated. While there are myriad alternatives to MMFs, all come with downsides,\" explained Jamie McGeever of Reuters. \"Given the high levels of uncertainty surrounding the year ahead — from geopolitical tensions to questions about President-elect Donald Trump's unorthodox policy agenda – the environment is likely to remain cash-friendly.\"\n“There’s little in the data to justify cuts in the current environment of strong growth and sticky inflation, especially with uncertainty around tariffs and the potential for deregulation contributing to animal spirits,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. interest rates strategy at Societe Generale, to Bloomberg. “If that’s the case, what’s the rush to move money out of MMFs and into other assets?”\nRead more: Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2024\nA big part of President-elect Trump's campaign was putting an end to inflation. But with plans to impose tariffs on foreign goods and crack down on migrant workers, the fear is that inflation will pick up rather than slow down. In fact, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists penned a letter earlier this year warning that Trump's plans could cause a surge in inflation and lead to a less stable U.S. economy.\nDuring periods of economic upheaval, the stock market can be volatile. So an MMF may be a safer place to park cash right now. Economic instability could also drive unemployment rates upward. If you’re worried about job loss, choosing a fairly liquid investment like a money market fund could be wise, as you’d be able to expect easy access to your money should you need it in the absence of a paycheck.\nOf course, without a crystal ball, there’s no telling how the economy will fare in the next four years. But if your primary goal is stability, then adding money market funds to your portfolio could be a good bet.\nHowever, you don’t want to get your asset allocation wrong and miss out on potential long-term returns from riskier investments like the stock market. The main rule of investing is to maintain a balanced, diversified portfolio that's appropriate for your investing horizon and financial goals. A popular rule of thumb is that cash and cash equivalents should make up between 2% and 10% of your portfolio.\nMMFs allow you to grow your money in a relatively safe manner. These funds offer the upside of being very liquid, and they’re not as risky as other mutual funds. Depending on market conditions, you may be able to earn a better return in an MMF than from a savings account or CD.\nIf you’re saving for a specific goal that’s four years out, like buying a house or retiring, then an MMF could be an appropriate investment.\nAn MMF might seem like a great place to put your cash if you’re worried about near-term economic volatility. But there are some drawbacks to these funds you should know about.\nFirst, you don't get the same FDIC protection as a savings account or CD, yet you may not get so much of a better return that it’s worth giving that protection up. But perhaps the biggest disadvantage of an MMF is that you may be looking at only modest returns.\nOver a four-year period, playing it safe with your money makes sense if there’s a milestone like retirement coming up at the end of it. Otherwise, you may want to keep your money in an S&P index fund instead.\nSay you put $10,000 into an MMF over the next four years. If you earn 3% a year, you’ve grown your balance to about $11,250. If you put that same $10,000 into an S&P 500 index fund that gives you an 8% return, which is a notch below the stock market’s historical average, you’re looking at $13,600 instead.\nNow to be fair, there’s a flaw in this example. S&P 500 index funds are best suited for people with a longer investment horizon than four years. So if you only want to tie up cash for four years, then again, an MMF may be a sound choice.\nBut if you have a 10-year window before you might need to use your $10,000, then an MMF paying you 3% during that time grows your balance to about $13,400. An S&P 500 index fund paying 8% gets you to almost $21,600.\nThat being said, MMFs are a great way to diversify your portfolio with some safe and stable assets.\nCar insurance in America now costs a stunning $2,329/year on average — but here’s how 2 minutes can save you more than $600 in 2025\nRich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord.

        "title": "America’s largest economy is falling out of love with Tesla—and it’s only going to get worse",
        "date": "2024-07-19T14:43:19.000Z",
        "article_content": "This might be the end of a love affair that became unrequited. Elon Musk has been steadfast in bashing California and has pledged to move Tesla, SpaceX, and X to Texas. Californians, in turn, are turning their backs on Musk.\nTesla sales in California dropped 24.1 % in the second quarter, the brand’s third straight quarterly decline in the state. Purchases dipped 7.8% in the first quarter of 2024 and 9.8% in the final quarter of last year. Year-to-date, Tesla sales in California are down 17% compared to last year, according to the latest analysis of new vehicle registrations published by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA). Instead of a Tesla from Musk’s $793 billion electric vehicle empire, California car buyers are purchasing battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) from Toyota, Hyundai, and Ford. The analysis found Toyota BEV registrations have soared 108.1% so far this year, while Hyundai and Ford BEV registrations rose 65.7% and 26.4%, respectively.\nPlenty of factors are at play in Tesla’s sales decline, Brian Maas, president of the CNCDA, told Fortune. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are substantially the same vehicles they were five years ago, and buyers interested in those cars might represent a finite share of the market—and they might already own a Tesla. Without new models to entice customers, buyers look elsewhere for new cars, he said. And while Tesla has dominated the EV market, the past several years have seen competitors creep in and erode the company’s share with lower costs, newer cars, and greater variety, he explained. Accordingly, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is now the third best-selling EV in California this year, wresting control of third place from the Tesla Model X, the CNCDA analysis found.\nAnd while the data is based only on registrations in California, branding could work against Musk. About 46.9% of registered voters in California are Democrats, while 23.9% of registered voters are Republicans. According to reputational management firm Caliber, more Republicans trust and like Musk than Democrats. Critically, however, more Democrats are willing to buy Teslas, which could be because Democrats are more likely to prioritize buying an electric vehicle over a gas-powered car, Caliber CEO Shahar Silbershatz told Fortune’s Eva Roytburg.\nNow, staunchly Blue California has learned about Musk’s reported $45 million a month donation to a pro-Trump Super PAC and his endorsement of the former president and Republican Party nominee. This might not bode well for already declining sales, and the Hyundai Ioniq’s rising popularity could be the first blush of a blue backlash.\n“When there’s a shift in the brand, that’s always going to have an impact on consumer behavior,” said Maas. \nTo be sure, Tesla is still the car of choice in California. The top-selling car is the Tesla Model Y in the new-vehicle market of BEVs and plug-in hybrids. The second top-selling BEV and plug-in model is the Model 3. Yet, California has embraced BEVs in droves, while other car buyers haven’t been as enthusiastic. According to Experian, California’s BEV market share is 21.4%, while the overall U.S. market share of BEVs is 7.5%.\nWithout detailed research, it’s difficult to connect Musk’s political views with buying trends, in Maas’ view. It’s more likely that Tesla sales are sluggish because the cars haven’t been revised or refreshed in years and people invest in durability, features, safety, and affordability—not a CEO’s mindset.\n“Mr. Musk’s political views could change tomorrow,” said Maas. “That being said, I assume the effect is not zero.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-02-12T20:22:56.000Z",
        "article_content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 largest economies in the world by 2040. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Economies in the World by 2040.\nThe current scenario of the global economy doesn’t give us a clear picture of the near-term economic situation with certainty. The recent major events that led to global economic uncertainty began with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was followed by worldwide lockdowns, supply chain distributions, international trade cut-offs, downsizing, and most importantly, a crisis in the global health sector. As we mentioned earlier, the economy seems to be in the recovery stage with global growth expected to remain steady at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025. \nAccording to research by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), the world’s fastest years of economic growth have likely already passed. Population growth is weakening, climate change, and increasing geopolitical risks, among other factors will impact the global economy. However, the emerging economies and major economies in Asia are directed to keep catching up to richer countries. According to the IMF's GDP forecast for 2030, 16 Asian countries will be among the leading economies. China, India, Indonesia, and Japan will be among the top six economies by 2050 along with the US and Germany. As per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) 2075 forecast, China will be the leading economy with India in second place, the US in third place, and Indonesia in fourth. Nigeria and Pakistan will climb up the ranks to fifth and sixth place in 2075, respectively. \nThe global economy is forecasted to grow at an average of 2.8% annually between 2024 and 2029 and to gradually decline thereafter, as per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). This shows a slow economic growth compared to an average growth rate of 3.6% for the 10 years before the global financial crisis and 3.2% in the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason for slow economic growth is due to the ebbing population growth rate. During the past 50 years, the global population has halved. According to UN projections, the world’s population is expected to increase by almost 2 billion in the next 30 years. This would mean that in 2050 the world’s population will reach 9.7 billion from the current population of 8 billion. The global population could peak at a forecasted 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s. Apart from the population, economists expect weakening productivity to be another key reason for slow GDP growth in the future. \nDespite the slow economic growth worldwide, emerging economies will keep on growing more swiftly than developed economies. China is most likely to overtake the US by 2035, becoming the world’s largest economy. China, India, and Indonesia have outperformed Goldman Sachs economists’ forecasts from 2011, while Brazil, Russia, and Latin America have underperformed Goldman Sachs’ projections. According to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) economists:\nCorporations are always a key element in driving the growth of an economy. The US is way ahead of most economies as far as the dominance of corporations is concerned around the world. Leading firms including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are key to the US economic progress. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are bigger than most economies, having a market capitalization of $2.92 trillion and $3.12 trillion, as of February 10. \nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a big player in the tech sector. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company posted earnings per share of $2.18, beating consensus estimates by $0.08 per share. The revenue came in at $119.58 billion, surpassing estimates by $1.31 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made the following comments during its Q1 2024 earnings call:\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading global tech firm. On January 30, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The company reported earnings per share of $2.93, surpassing estimates by $0.16. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) revenue was $62.02 billion for Q2 2024, ahead of market consensus by $888.19 million. The company continues to expand its cloud and AI network. Here are some of the comments from the Q2 2024 earnings call:\nNow, let’s take a look at the largest economies in the world by 2040. \n25 Largest Economies in the World by 2040\nOur Methodology\nWe have compiled the largest economies in the world by 2040 based on projections made by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). To check the room for subjectivity, we also referred to forecasts made by the IMF and PwC for the biggest economies in the world in 2028 and 2050, respectively. To rank the largest economies in the world by 2040, we used the forecasted real GDP for 2040 from The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) Global Economics Paper The Path to 2075. For the countries with similar forecasted real GDP in 2040, we used Population as a tie-breaker. We collected population data from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division. \nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "article_content": "Economic issues are top of mind for many voters as they head to the polls this election cycle. According to a recent GOBankingRates survey, the top economic concerns among American voters are inflation (49%) and the future of Social Security and Medicare (27%). As for which candidate they feel would be better for the U.S. economy, Americans seem to be almost evenly split — 44% believe Vice President Kamala Harris will be better for the economy, while 39% believe former President Donald Trump will benefit the economy more.\nLearn More: Financial Expert: 4 Economic Predictions for the Day After the Election If Kamala Harris Wins\nFind Out: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nWhile the American public doesn’t see a clear winner when it comes to which presidential candidate will be better for the economy, many economic experts believe the economy is in better hands under a Harris White House. More than half of the living U.S. recipients of the Nobel Prize for economics signed a letter stating that a Harris agenda would be “vastly better for the U.S. economy” — here’s why.\nTrending Now:\nBoomers Have the Wealth--Why Are Thousands Still Homeless?\nSuze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nThe group of 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists outlined a number of reasons why they felt Harris would be better for the U.S. economy than Trump.\n“While each of us has different views on the particulars of various economic policies, we believe that, overall, Harris’ economic agenda will improve our nation’s health, investment, sustainability, resilience, employment opportunities and fairness, and be vastly superior to the counterproductive economic agenda of Donald Trump,” the letter stated.\nThe economists who signed the letter expressed concerns about the effects of Trump’s proposed tariffs and tax cuts.\n“His policies, including high tariffs — even on goods from our friends and allies — and regressive tax cuts for corporations and individuals, will lead to higher prices, larger deficits and greater inequality,” they wrote. “Among the most important determinants of economic success are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these.”\nThe economists believe that even though “details of the presidential candidates’ economic programs are not fully laid out yet,” Harris’ proposed policies should improve the overall economy.\n“Harris has emphasized policies that strengthen the middle class, enhance competition and promote entrepreneurship,” they wrote. “On issue after issue, Harris’ economic agenda will do far more than Donald Trump’s to increase the economic strength and well-being of our nation and its people.\n“Simply put,” the letter concluded, “Harris’ policies will result in a stronger economic performance, with economic growth that is more robust, more sustainable and more equitable.”\nExplore More: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for Social Security If Kamala Harris Wins the Election\nWhile this group of economists came out in strong support of Harris, other financial experts believe that a Trump presidency would be better for the economy. Cliff Ambrose, founder and wealth manager at Apex Wealth, previously spoke to GOBankingRates about the reasons he feels a Trump presidency would be better for the economy, including the likely renewal of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and looser regulations that could spark economic growth and reduce unemployment.\n“I think if you take his character out of it and just focus on what his strengths are, it would be in the deal-making arena,” Ambrose said. “A guy who is incredibly successful in business sounds like a guy I would want running, arguably, one of the most powerful corporations in the world, which is the United States. From that pure economic standpoint, that would be my opinion.”\nDawn Allcot contributed to the reporting for this article. \nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "Dublin, June 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Thematic Intelligence: Sharing Economy\" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The sharing economy is an economic system in which private individuals share assets and services, either free or for a charge, often using a community-based online platform. As the world grows ever more interconnected, the sharing economy is based on ideas of community. Individuals can share assets such as clothes and toys or services such as household skills and insurance. The sharing economy displaces the notion of ownership as individuals can rent rather than buy assets.\nKey Highlights\nAccording to consensus forecasts, the sharing economy market is expected to reach over $1 trillion in revenue by 2031. As the sharing economy model reaches maturity, companies that made their name as disruptors, like Uber and Airbnb, are now the incumbents. They face a new wave of disruption from smaller players harnessing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain.\nNew technologies such as generative AI allow sharing economy platforms to enhance their services. Companies such as Airbnb and Lemonade have integrated AI into their offerings to provide more personalized recommendations or more efficient services. As AI develops, sharing economy platforms will use it to understand their consumers better and provide more personalized offerings.\nReport Scope\nThis report provides an overview of the sharing economy theme.\nIt identifies the key trends impacting growth of the theme over the next 12 to 24 months, split into three categories: technology trends, macroeconomic trends, and regulatory trends.\nIt includes comprehensive industry analysis, including analysis of company filings and hiring trends.\nIt contains details of M&A deals driven by the sharing economy theme and a timeline highlighting milestones in the development of the sharing economy.\nThe detailed value chain is split into four segments: shared assets and services, infrastructure, sharing economy platforms, and use cases.\nOver the past few years, the sharing economy has grown rapidly, driven by increased urbanization, technological advancements, greater familiarity with peer-to-peer sharing, fewer entry barriers, and the financial gains it offers to consumers. Moreover, high mobile penetration and the increasingly important position of millennials in the global economy-alongside increased demand for shared assets-have paved the way for new business opportunities and additional revenue streams for both individuals and businesses.\nThis report provides a detailed overview of this increasingly important theme, including identifying leading companies across all aspects of the sharing economy.\nKey Topics Covered:\nExecutive Summary\nPlayers\nThematic Briefing\nTrends\nIndustry Analysis\nSignals\nValue Chain\nCompanies\nSector Scorecards\nCompany Coverage:\n3M\n99designs\n9flats\nAbcomrents\nAdvance Mobility\nAgiliti\nAgoda\nAirbnb\nAlibaba\nAlliant Credit Union\nAlphabet\nAmazon\nAnyplace\nAppear Here\nBabonbo\nBaboodle\nBetterLesson\nBigRentz\nBillionElectric\nBlaBlaBus\nBlaBlaCar\nBlend Network\nBlueSG\nBMW\nBoatsetter\nBolt\nBolt Technologies\nBoohoo\nBooking Holdings\nBoxMySpace\nBrainly\nBreather\nBrixmor\nBy Rotation\nByju's\nCare.com\nCarma Technology\nCarNextDoor\nCarsharing Russia\nCarvolution\nCaterpillar\nCertilligo\nCeva Logistics\nCheapTickets\nChegg\nChina Rapid Finance\nChowbotics\nCircleUp\nClassy\nClever Tots Toy Club\nClick & Boat\nCloud of Goods\nCocoon\nCodeacademy\nCohealo\nColeman Research\nCollateral Medical\nCoursera\nCoursmos\nCoworking Bansko\nCraigslist\nCrowdcube\nDaimler\nDance\nDegreed\nDelimobil\nDeliveroo\nDeskpass\nDHL\nDidi Chuxing\nDoorDash\nDozr\nDreamBox Learning\nDrivezy\nDrizly\neasyCar Pool\neBay\nEdisonLearning\nEquipmentShare\nEtherisc\nEuropcar Mobility Group\nEvCard\nevmo\nExpedia\nFedEx\nFenix Technologies\nFirstUp\nFiverr\nFlex IT Rent\nFlexjet\nFluro\nFreelancer\nFriendsurance\nGamePlanner.AI\nGetaround\nGetmyboat\nGett\nGetTaxi\nGlamcorner\nGoFundMe\nGoGet\nGojek\nGoldbell Engineering\nGoldman Sachs\nGores Metropoulos II\nGrab Holdings\nGreen Mobility Holding\nGroupe Beneteau\nGrover\nGSE AudioVisual\nGuru\nGwynnie Bee\nHala Mobility\nHamilton Rentals\nHeetch\nHerc Rentals\nHilton Worldwide\nHoliday Swapping\nHome Depot\nHomeAway\nHomeExchange\nHomeToGo\nHoop Carpool\nHoop Solutions\nHotels.com\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH)\nHubstaff\nHumanForest\nHurr\nHyreCar\nIBM\nImpact Hub\nIndiegogo\nIndustrious Offices\nInPost\nInterep\nIWG\nJump Bikes\nJustos\nKayak\nKickstarter\nKiki\nkion group\nKiva\nKiwiCo\nKnownOrigin\nKuadi Dache\nLaka\nLakestar SPAC I\nLandbay\nLark\nLark Technologies\nLearning Pool\nLedger Investing\nLemonade\nLenders Funding\nLendingclub\nLendis\nLiftshare\nLoop\nLyft\nMadeComfy\nMahindra and Mahindra\nMakeMyTrip\nMarriott International\nMasterclass\nMaxi Mobility\nMcGraw Hill\nMedShare\nMeru Travel Solutions\nMeta\nMicrosoft\nMindspace\nMinut\nMondee\nMondial Relay\nMotional\nMottu\nMyWardrobeHQ\nNaver\nNestaway\nNetJets\nNetworking Premium Coworking\nNewmark Group\nNewsela\nNextdoor\nNexus Mutual\nNippon Express\nNooka Space\nOla\nOla cabs\nOpenbazaar\nOpenTable\nOrbitz\nOriental Land\nPalm Teknoloji\nPango Mobile Parking\nPathfinder\nPatreon\nPBSC Urban Solutions\nPearson\nPeerform\nPeoplePerHour\nPorch Group\nPoshmark\nPostmates (acq)\nPremier Workspaces\nPricepally Nigeriar\nProsper\nReadySpaces\nRent The Runway\nRentacomputer\nRush Computer Rentals\nSeedrs\nServiceScape\nSety\nShared Medical Services\nSharing Economy International\nShein\nShquared\nShuidihuzhu\nSK Telecom\nSkillshare\nSkillsoft\nSkootel\nSkyHive\nSocar\nSoFi\nSoftbank\nSonder\nSparkPlus\nSpartan Logistics\nStashbee\nStellantis\nStoke Talent\nStorefront\nStorefrpnt\nStylework\nSunbelt Rentals\nSurfAir\nTarget\nTaskRabbit\nTeachers Pay Teachers\nThe Volte\nThe Wing\nThumbtack\nTikTok\nTokopedia\nToptal\nToy Box Monthly\nToyRentJunction\nTravelocity\nTravelscape\nTripAdvisor\ntwitter\nUber\nUcommune\nUdacity\nUdemy\nUnited Rentals\nUpshift\nUpstart\nUpwork\nUride\nUS Med-Equip\nvacationspot\nVELCO\nVenture X\nVia Transportation\nVisasQ\nVistajet\nVOI Technologies\nVrbo\nVTB Bank\nWalmart\nWareSpace\nWeWork\nWheels Up\nWhirli\nWiziboat\nWolters Kluwer\nWonolo\nWoven Planet\nWunder Mobility\nxNomad\nYamaha Motor\nZipcar\nZomato\nZoomcar\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/xe3ewl\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

        "article_content": "The US economy could see a surge in growth as more people start to take GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.\nGoldman Sachs predicted that US GDP could jump by 1% if 60 million Americans took a GLP-1 drug.\nGoldman Sachs also said that \"poor health imposes significant economic costs.\"\nThe more people who take GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, the faster the US economy could grow, a Goldman Sachs analyst said in a note last month.\nThe US GDP could grow by an extra 1% if 60 million Americans took GLP-1 drugs by 2028, Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote.\nHatzius said health-related problems keep people from participating in the labor force and inhibit economic growth. Obesity increases the risk of serious health problems, including heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes.\n\"Combining current losses in hours worked and labor force participation from sickness and disability, early deaths, and informal caregiving, we estimate that GDP would potentially be over 10% higher if poor health outcomes did not limit labor supply in the US,\" Hatzius said.\nSo drugs that have shown promise in improving a range of patient health outcomes could have a sizable impact on the broader economy.\n\"The main reason we see meaningful upside from healthcare innovation is that poor health imposes significant economic costs. There are several channels through which poor health weighs on economic activity that could diminish if health outcomes improve,\" Hatzius said.\nGLP-1 drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly and Company are sold under the brand names Ozempic and Mounjaro to treat type 2 diabetes, and under the names Wegovy and Zepbound to treat obesity.\nSales of the drugs have exploded, with some users seeing drastic weight loss of up to 20%. A study released in August found that patients who took Wegovy for weight loss reduced their risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular death by 20%.\nAnd with the US obesity rate hovering at around 40%, tens of millions of Americans could be prescribed GLP-1 drugs over the next few years, but just how many will depend on the outcome of clinical trials on these drugs and whether health insurers will cover them.\n\"If GLP-1 usage ultimately increases by this amount and results in lower obesity rates, we see scope for significant spillovers to the broader economy,\" Hatzius said.\nOne spillover effect could be an increase in productivity, Hatzius said, citing academic studies that found obese individuals are less likely to work and to be less productive at work\n\"These estimates therefore suggest that obesity-related health complications subtract over 3% from per-capita output, implying an over 1% hit to total output when combined with the over 40% incidence of obesity in the US population,\" Hatzius said.\nAnd if there are more productivity gains via improved health outcomes, the impact on GDP growth in excess of its current trend could be between 0.6% and 3.2%.\n\"Historically, health advancements have lowered the number of life years lost to disease and disability by 10% per decade in DM economies, and we estimate that a 10-year step forward in health progress in excess of current trends could raise the level of US GDP by 1%,\" Hatzius said.\nThis story was originally published in March 2024.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "article_content": "In this article, we will take a look at the U.S. State with the Fastest-Growing Economy. We have also compiled a full free list of the 20 U.S. States with the Fastest-Growing Economies.\nPost the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is currently in a recovery phase after the unprecedented declines that incurred between 2019 and 2022. However, this recovery is not as smooth as one would have hoped for. Factors like geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, high inflation, and tightened monetary conditions have been slowing down the recovery process. One of the biggest problems that the world is battling with currently is inflation. However, a few recent developments hint towards a brighter future with headline inflation levels declining to prepandemic levels in some economies. By the end of 2023, global inflation fell to around 2.3% which was a significant decrease from the peak of 9.5% witnessed in the second quarter of 2022. But this progress is limited to a few developed economies like the U.S., China, and Germany. These are the most powerful countries in the world by economy, with GDP levels of $28.8 trillion, $18.5 trillion, and $4.6 trillion, respectively, as of 2024 - we have discussed them in detail in 20 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy.\nOne of the countries that have led this post pandemic recovery is the United States. The country has been capable of preserving its status as the leading global economy. According to the IMF, the GDP of the US was $26.95 trillion in 2023. The value for real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The United States is expected to continue climbing at this trajectory as the country is projected to have a real GDP of $32 trillion by the year 2040. For developing countries, however, it is a completely different story. These economies have been recovering but the recovery is quite slow, with inflation in the last quarter of 2023 standing at 9.9%. You can refer to 25 Countries with Developing Economies but Slow Growth Rates, to read about some of these economies in depth. Saudi Arabia and Poland are two of such economies with slowest growth rates amongst the developing economies with GDP levels of $1.07 trillion and $842.2 billion, as of 2023.\nWhile these macroeconomic trends provide us with a broader picture of the economy, the role of major corporations and industry giants in the rebuilding of the economy cannot be overlooked. Among other factors, businesses across major economic regions are driving the growth globally. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are two of the most valuable companies in the US. With a market capitalization of $3.311 trillion, as of 13th June 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest player in the technology sector. As of 2024, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) installed base of active devices has exceeded 2.2 billion globally. Apple reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 on February 1, 2024. The revenue came in at $119.58 billion, surpassing estimates by $1.31 billion while earnings per share of $2.18 beat the consensus estimates by $0.08 per share.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading global technology firm with a market capitalization of $3.283 trillion, as of 13th June 2024. According to the quarterly financial reports released on January 30, 2024 for the second quarter of 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported earnings per share of $2.93, surpassing estimates by $0.16. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) revenue was $62.02 billion for Q2 2024, ahead of market consensus by $888.19 million.\nAn investment banker monitoring the performance of the Brazilian stock index, emphasizing the importance of the company in the economy.\nFor the purpose of this ranking, we acquired data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on the real GDP for each US state. From the values of the latest year, 2023 and the base year, 2022, percentage change in real GDP was calculated.

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn in for a second term next month, prompting economic changes that could affect everything from taxes to tariffs. For millennials, now is a critical time to prepare, as Trump’s economic proposals could affect their taxes, student loan repayments, purchasing power and jobs.\nLearn More: The Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Boomers Should Make Before Inauguration Day\nFor You: How To Financially Plan for the New Year Under the New Trump Presidency\n“Regardless of the changes in the economy and tax policy, it is a good idea for millennials to pay down debt, save for retirement and build an emergency fund,” said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a TurboTax expert.\nAs the Trump economy begins, here are four money moves millennials should make before Inauguration Day.\nGreene-Lewis said investing in retirement savings could help millennials lower their taxes while building their nest egg. For example, millennials can contribute up to $23,000 in their 401(k) plans by Dec. 31 to lower their taxable income.\n“If your employer matches your contributions, then it’s a win-win,” Greene-Lewis said. “You can also consider contributing to your IRA. For the 2024 tax year, you can contribute up to $7,000, and you may be able to take a deduction for the contribution.”\nGreene-Lewis also recommended millennials take advantage of the Retirement Contributions Savers Credit, also known as the “Savers Credit.” It is a special tax break for low- and moderate-income taxpayers who are saving for retirement. The maximum credit amounts are $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for married households filing jointly.\nRead Next: How Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency May Impact Your Wallet\nJustin Peters, host of the personal finance podcast “The Struggle is Real,” said he doesn’t anticipate the incoming Trump administration favoring a particular asset class.\n“My personal strategy is to continue to buy and hold low-cost index funds that cover all of the U.S. and international stock market,” Peters said. “These can be easily purchased through online brokerage accounts like Fidelity or Vanguard.”\nPeters recommended considering the fund’s expense ratio.\n“This is the cost to own that fund,” he explained. “Look for funds that charge less than 0.25%.”\nAlex Blackwood, CEO and co-founder of mogul Club, a fractional real estate investing app, said millennials should consider investing in alternative assets with steady returns.\n“Looking at the stock market, a number of analysts at Goldman [Sachs] and J.P. Morgan are forecasting sub-par returns for the stock market in the coming years,” Blackwood said. “So, alternative assets might be the safest inflation hedge.”\nBlackwood said millennials should consider investing in real estate, because it could offer a steady cash flow with the upside of appreciation.\nBlackwood said millennials shouldn’t gamble their entire livelihood on one job, especially during times of policy changes or market shifts.\n“In periods of economic turmoil, jobs can be lost due to external circumstances that you cannot control,” Blackwood said. “By creating multiple income streams, you are not overly reliant on one.”\nSeveral studies found that about half of all millennials have a side hustle. According to statistics compiled by Millennial Money, millennials make an extra $12,689 a year from side hustles.\nAccording to Deloitte’s Global 2024 Gen Z and Millennial Survey, while 40% of millennials said they felt more optimistic about the economy than they did four years ago, about a third (32%) said financial insecurity was a significant concern, and over half reported living paycheck to paycheck.\nHowever, millennials can take practical steps to prepare for potential market shifts and minimize financial insecurity, said Christopher Stroup, founder and president of Silicon Beach Financial.\n“Millennials can offset inflation by cutting discretionary expenses, leveraging budgeting tools and prioritizing essential needs,” Stroup said. “Automated savings, such as for retirement or an emergency fund, can help ensure that long-term goals aren’t neglected while managing short-term price increases in housing and groceries.”\nIn addition, millennials can change their budgeting strategy to reflect their priorities.\n“Millennials can offset rising living costs by adopting a zero-based budget, prioritizing essentials and cutting discretionary expenses like subscriptions or dining out,” said personal finance expert Pattie Ehsaei.\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "In this article, we will list the 20 biggest gig economy companies in the world. If you want to skip our discussion about the gig economy, go to the 7 Biggest Gig Economy Companies In The World.\nThe gig economy is a labor market that utilizes part-time and temporary roles. These roles are usually occupied by freelancers and independent contractors. It gives the workers freedom and independence and allows companies to save on costs. However, gig work comes at the cost of job security, paid leaves, and health insurance among other benefits of permanent employment.\nA gig economy company is any entity that facilitates gig workers to secure temporary or contractual positions. However, there are gray areas that might make it difficult to identify a gig economy company. It is straightforward to identify companies such as Upwork Global Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Fiverr International Ltd. (NYSE:FVRR) as gig economy companies. However, it might not be easy to notice that e-commerce platforms such as Shopif, Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) also belong to the gig economy.\nThe e-commerce platform offers numerous ways for gig workers to procure freelance work from marketplaces such as Fiverr and Upwork, thus facilitating them. Some experts, for example, earn money by setting up entire Shopify websites for their clients. For our list of the 20 biggest gig economy companies in the world, we have included some companies that might not appear to belong in the gig economy but actually have a place there. If you are interested in gig economy stocks, check out this list of the best gig economy stocks to invest in.\nGig economy workers are on the rise in the United States and the world. According to the 2023 Freelance Forward Report by Upwork Global Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK), 39% of Americans did some sort of freelance work in 2022, up from 36% in 2021. Upwork's Future Workplace 2022 report also reported that 66% of the surveyed hiring managers who engage with independent talent, plan to increase their utilization of freelancers over the next two years. These gig workers have a significant economic footprint in the United States. According to Upwork's Freelance Forward Report, they contributed $1.35 trillion to the US economy in terms of annual earnings in 2022. It is no surprise, therefore, that the United States has the biggest gig economy.\nThe American Opportunity Survey by McKinsey, which involved more than 25,000 Americans, found that one-third of its respondents doing independent work earn more than $150,000 per year. The category of high-earning remote workers includes lawyers, accountants, actors, and social media influencers, among others. However, these high earners are in the minority as young people and those with less training take work with fewer barriers to entry, such as driving passengers or delivering takeout meals. In addition, the majority (54%) of independent workers were concerned about the stability of their jobs.\nA recent World Bank report Working Without Borders, explains that many young workers are using digital platforms to access work from all over the globe. According to the World Bank, youth make up over half of the online gig workforce. Therefore, it is not wrong to assume that any improvement in the gig economy will lead to improvement in the working conditions of the youth. Many policymakers around the world have now turned their attention to the gig economy. Since President Biden took office, the US Labor Department has taken significant regulatory action, which includes rules that spell out the process by which companies must determine how a worker is classified and the benefits they should receive. However, several US businesses have recently escalated their legal battle against the Biden administration's measures by claiming that these rules are costly and can decimate the gig economy.\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 20 biggest gig economy companies in the world.\nA close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app.\nTo curate our list of the 20 biggest gig economy companies in the world, we first curated a list of the major publicly listed gig economy companies.

        "title": "China laments ‘garbage time of history’ as economy comes off peak and growth model hits dead end, expert says",
        "date": "2024-09-09T17:20:32.000Z",
        "article_content": "People in China are so discouraged about the economic outlook that many have taken to social media to call it the “garbage time of history,” referring to the end of NBA games when the result is settled and players go through the motions until time runs out.\nUse of the phrase earned rebukes from state-run media over the summer, but it tapped into a deepening gloom that has spread to Wall Street as fresh data point to worsening weakness in top economic drivers. Bank of America recently cut its 2024 growth forecast to 4.8% from 5% and sees further slowing in the next two years to 4.5%.\nIn an article for China Leadership Monitor last weekend, Rhodium Group partner Logan Wright said that while China is still growing faster than many other countries, its global influence probably peaked in 2021.\nThat’s when it reached 18.3% of world GDP, before dipping to 16.9% in 2023. Meanwhile, the U.S. share is sitting at about 25%.\nThe problem isn’t just cyclical. As Wright noted, “The primary reason that China’s economic slowdown is structural in nature is one that Beijing acknowledges: The credit- and investment-led growth model has reached a dead end.”\nAll that capital fed massive property construction and infrastructure development. But nothing has replaced them as growth drivers, and China’s teetering financial system is unlikely to give rise to any new ones, he wrote.\nCredit expansion will slow, dragging down investment growth and the economy’s long-term prospects, he said. Meanwhile, the political leadership’s fear of letting defaults, bankruptcies, and unemployment rise is preventing the financial system from channeling capital to more productive sectors of the economy.\n“The financial system itself is now constraining China’s economic growth rather than facilitating it,” Wright explained. “In addition to demographics and the changing external environment, financial constraints are the primary reason why China’s economic slowdown is structural in nature and why China’s economy is likely to grow at rates below potential over the next decade.”\nTo be sure, Beijing has known its old growth model couldn’t last and has promoted advanced manufacturing in emerging sectors like EVs and green energy as alternatives. But those aren’t big enough to offset declining property or infrastructure construction, he said.\nChina’s leadership has also identified the need to rebalance the economy toward more consumption instead of investment. But that’s hampered by income inequality that requires an overhaul of fiscal policy to prioritize transfer payments that boost household spending.\nGiven the obstacles, what’s likely to happen is that consumption growth will continue to decline gradually and weigh on future economic growth, Wright predicted.\nPresident Xi Jinping and China’s other leaders may not fully grasp the severity of the situation, as the official economic statistics they digest look increasingly dubious. At the same time, they also appear fixated on overtaking the U.S. as the world’s top economy.\nBut if Xi and company can change their worldview, it could help the Chinese economy, Wright said. For example, export-led growth that relies on taking global market share sparks trade barriers. By contrast, focusing more on domestic consumption could reduce trade conflicts.\nStill, he’s not convinced it will happen.\n“China’s economy peaking in global influence also offers Beijing a new opportunity to realistically redefine its goals and to become less confrontational with the rest of the world’s economic and political interests,” he said. “But we are under no illusions that such a redefinition is probable.”\nThe warning comes as investors have also been jolted recently by red flags about China’s economy.\nPDD Holdings, the parent company of e-commerce giant Temu, stunned Wall Street last month with weak quarterly results and a warning that intense competition will dampen future profits. Shares sank more than 30%, wiping out $50 billion in PDD’s market value.\nThat was the latest warning sign that the world’s second-largest economy could be headed for a downward spiral caused by overproduction and Beijing’s industrial planning.\n“Simply put, in many crucial economic sectors, China is producing far more output than it, or foreign markets, can sustainably absorb,” wrote Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a China scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, in Foreign Affairs magazine before the PDD reported earnings. “As a result, the Chinese economy runs the risk of getting caught in a doom loop of falling prices, insolvency, factory closures, and, ultimately, job losses.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-12-09T10:35:43.000Z",
        "article_content": "BANGKOK (AP) — China’s top leaders have pledged to loosen monetary policy and provide more support for the slowing economy, while Premier Li Qiang swiped at threats of higher tariffs on Chinese exports, saying they hinder global growth.\nShares in Hong Kong jumped Monday after state media released a report on the meeting by the ruling Communist Party’s Politburo that said leaders would “implement more active fiscal policies and moderately loose monetary policies.”\nThe shift to “moderately loose” from the “prudent” monetary policies of the past 14 years was taken as a significant shift by market players, unleashing a spate of buying that pushed the Hang Seng index up 2.8%.\n“This marks a significant recalibration in their approach, aiming to cushion the anticipated economic shocks” (from higher tariffs), Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\nSeveral months ago, the Chinese central bank and other regulators began rolling out various policies aimed at encouraging businesses and households to spend more money. Overall, Monday's statement mostly reiterated the same broad promises as usual.\n“The readout leaves little doubt that the shift toward a more supportive policy stance that began in September is still alive and well,” Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a report. He noted that the last such shift was in late 2008, during the global financial crisis, and that it may be followed by faster interest rate cuts in the coming year.\nMonday's meeting has set the tone for an annual economic planning meeting later in the week that will reaffirm policies for the coming year.\nChina's economy has growing a bit more slowly than the official target for a 5% expansion in annual terms this year, and the property market is still in the doldrums. Consumer spending remains subdued, having never fully recovered after the COVID-19 pandemic, and the statement from the Politburo meeting promised a “combination punch” of government spending and easier credit to help boost consumption.\nConsumer inflation in November was a lower-than-expected 0.2%, the government reported Monday, down from 0.3% the month before mainly due to lower food prices. That leaves ample room for interest rate cuts, analysts said.\nWith youth unemployment still relatively high and many households feeling the pinch of lower housing prices and unstable jobs, the statement called for improving the “people's sense of gain, happiness and security.”\n“We must do a good job in people's livelihood protection and security and stability the ensure the stability of the overall social situation,” it said.\nAlso Monday, Li, who as premier has the traditional role of overseeing the economy, met with heads of the World Bank and other big international financial organizations.\nLi did not refer to the United States by name, but took aim at countries that restrict trade through higher tariffs and other measures, in a veiled slam at Washington at a time when the U.S. has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology, while President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to sharply hike import duties on Chinese products.\n“If we look at the obstacles to economic globalization, some countries now easily resort to imposing additional high tariffs, erecting barriers of protection. There are more and more restrictive measures on trade,” Li said.\n“The reason why I’m talking about this issue is that under the background of weak economic growth of the world, this issue has further increased uncertainties and caused huge interference to the operation of the global economy,” he added."

        "title": "The ‘funflation’ economy is dying as a consumer attitude of ‘hard pass’ takes over and major artists cancel concert tours",
        "date": "2024-06-05T18:01:32.000Z",
        "article_content": "For the past few years, live music has enjoyed an explosive post-pandemic revival, as \"revenge spending\" fans itching to get back into concert venues post-pandemic paid top dollar for massive stadium tours such as Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour and Beyoncé’s Renaissance Tour.\nBut a recent spate of tour cancellations and changes by well-known artists indicate that consumers’ appetite for  live music may be slowing.\nOn Friday, Live Nation announced that Jennifer Lopez was canceling her “This Is Me…Live” tour to spend more time with her family, a week after the Black Keys said they were scrapping an arena tour scheduled for this fall in favor of smaller venues, even after the single from their new album topped Billboard’s Alternative Airplay chart in March.\nThe announcements are the most recent signs that at least one facet of the “funflation” or economy that emerged in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic—when consumers eager to make up for lost experiences boosted demand for things like flights and concert tickets—isn’t as strong as it was last year.\nJarred Arfa, head of global music at the touring agency Independent Artist Group, said he believes the current concert environment is less of a slowdown than a return to a pre-pandemic atmosphere, where “there's a lot of winners, but not everything is winning.”\n“The traffic is catching up to itself a little bit, where you still have so many artists on the road, and people have seen them already,” Arfa told Fortune. “Some of that novelty factor post-COVID is no longer there.”\nOne obvious factor is consumer fatigue with inflated costs. Since the world emerged from pandemic lockdowns, the price of concert tickets has soared. According to the music trade publication Pollstar, the average ticket price of a top 100 music tour between 2019 and 2023 increased at a rate that well outpaced inflation, jumping from $91.18 to $122.84.\n“The days where there was enough demand to sell out arenas at top dollar just isn’t there in this live events economy,” Dave Clark, editor of the entertainment-industry tracker Ticket News, said in an interview with NBC News.\n“People are seeing some of the prices they’re asking and just saying, ‘Hard pass.’”\nArfa also said there are more artists touring now than in the past—and not just because of time off during lockdown. A big part factor is the streaming era, in which touring generates much better returns for artists than what they make from streams. But since fans’ time—and wallets—are finite, that ultimately translates to a smaller slice of the pie for some performers.\n“You have people who normally might have spaced out their tours…who are now jumping back in,” Arfa said. “Maybe they would have taken a couple years off, but they got those COVID years off.”\n“The traffic is still probably a little bit higher than it normally would be,” he added.\nIt isn’t just tours that are settling down. The first weekend for Coachella, the highest-grossing festival in North America, didn’t sell out for almost a month. That’s far longer than in 2023 or 2022, when both weekends sold out in around 40 minutes following a two-year pandemic hiatus. On the day the 2024 festival opened, Billboard reported that approximately 80% of the 250,000 tickets had been sold.\nTicketmaster was among the biggest beneficiaries of the “revenge spending” phenomenon. Its parent, Live Nation, reported its biggest year ever in 2023 before the DOJ sued the company in May, alleging it had violated antitrust laws. Following last year's Taylor Swift and Beyoncé megatours, the ticketing giant reported a $10 billion increase in total revenue, while concert attendance was up 20%.\nBut there are early signs that growth might slow down in 2024. Last week, Axios reported that resale prices for summer concert tickets are down about 17% (or an average of $45 per ticket) from last year, citing data from SeatGeek. In May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported that April prices for movie and concert tickets climbed 3.4% from last year, the lowest increase since 2021.\nWhat’s more, in addition to the DOJ lawsuit, concert cancellations, and popular discontent, Ticketmaster is also dealing with a data breach affecting millions of customers.\nIn a statement, Ticketmaster parent Live Nation said, “overall market data shows demand is strong - sales are up from last year with over 100 million tickets sold, even with fewer large stadium shows touring in 2024.” The company added that cancellation rates for concerts this year were around 4%, on par with last year.\nFor the biggest artists on tour this summer—Olivia Rodrigo, Morgan Wallen, and Zach Bryan—there’s still plenty of demand. The average resale price on SeatGeek for Rodgrigo’s “Guts” tour is $571, according to Axios. But even that is a far cry from the astronomical resale prices posted for the Eras Tour last summer, which reached into the thousands.\n“On the megatour level, I think there may be a few less of them this year,” Arfa said. “Some artists just automatically go out every couple of years and think they're bulletproof. And that's not the case. Not everyone can be Taylor and Beyoncé.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-09-26T16:41:55.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a four-month low last week, suggesting that the labor market remained fairly healthy.\nThe upbeat outlook on the economy was underscored by other data on Thursday showing corporate profits increased at a more robust pace than initially thought in the second quarter.\nStrong profit growth should help to underpin the labor market and investment. The economy's resilience could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to deliver another 50 basis points interest rate cut in November as some investors are hoping.\n\"The economy remains strong and the need for additional large rate cuts are questionable if the economy continues to move forward at a brisk pace,\" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS.\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended Sept. 21, the lowest level since mid-May, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 claims. Unadjusted claims decreased 5,957 to 180,878 last week.\nThough the labor market has lost momentum amid declining job openings and a step-down in hiring, layoffs have remained low.\nBut a strike by about 30,000 machinists at Boeing, which has forced the aerospace company to announce temporary furloughs of tens of thousands of employees, including what it said was \"a large number of U.S.-based executives, managers and employees\" could boost claims.\nStriking workers are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the work stoppage could cause employment disruptions at Boeing's suppliers in addition to the temporary furloughs.\nThe number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.834 million during the week ending Sept. 14, the claims report showed.\nThe so-called continuing claims have dropped from more than 2-1/2-year highs touched in July, attributed to policy changes in Minnesota that allowed non-teaching staff to file for unemployment aid during the summer school holidays.\nThe continuing claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed households for September's unemployment rate. Continuing claims fell between the August and September survey week. The jobless rate slipped to 4.2% in August after rising to 4.3% in July. The increase in the unemployment rate from 3.4% in April 2023 as a surge in immigration boosted labor supply has raised fears of rapid labor market deterioration.\nThe U.S. central bank last week cut interest rates by 50 basis points to the 4.75%-5.00% range, the first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this was meant to demonstrate policymakers' commitment to sustaining a low unemployment rate.\nFinancial markets saw a roughly 54% chance of another half-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed's Nov. 6-7 policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool. The odds of a 25 basis points rate reduction were around 46%.\nStocks on Wall Street traded higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.\nSTRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH\nA separate report from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis showed corporate profits including inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased at a $132.5 billion annualized rate in the second quarter. They were revised up from the $57.6 billion pace estimated last month.\nThe revision reflected a sharp upgrade to domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations, now estimated to have increased $108.8 billion, instead of $29.2 billion. That could support business spending on equipment.\nIncome at the disposal of households was also solid.\nAs a result, gross domestic income growth, which measures economic activity from the income side, was revised up to a 3.4% rate last quarter from the initially estimated 1.3% pace. GDI rose at an upwardly revised 3.0% pace in the January-March quarter from the previously reported 1.3% rate.\nGross domestic product growth, the traditional measure of economic growth, was unrevised at a 3.0% rate last quarter, in line with economists' expectations. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice they differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data.\nThe government revised the national accounts data from the first quarter of 2019 through the first quarter of 2024. The revisions showed economic growth and corporate profits were stronger in 2023 than previously estimated.\nThe revision narrowed the gap between GDP and GDI, which some economists have argued suggested that GDP was overstating the economy's health.\nThe so-called statistical discrepancy contracted to 0.3% of GDP in the second quarter, revised down from 2.7% previously.\nEven more encouraging, the saving rate was raised to 5.2% last quarter from the previously estimated 3.3%.\nThere had been concerns among some economists that consumers were running down savings to fund spending.\n\"Households are in much better shape,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.\nThe average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 3.2% rate last quarter, revised up from the previously estimated 2.1%. Gross domestic output advanced at a 2.3% pace in the first quarter, revised up from the previously reported 1.4% pace.\n\"The revisions only strengthen our conviction that the U.S. economy will continue to expand at a decent pace over the coming year, which suggests labor market conditions are unlikely to deteriorate markedly from here,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n\"We think that will push Fed officials toward a more gradual series of interest rate cuts in the quarters ahead.\"\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Peter Graff)"

        "date": "2024-06-04T20:33:14.000Z",
        "article_content": "With persistent inflation, war-induced energy price shocks, and rising geopolitical tensions gripping the global economy over the past four years, some of Wall Street’s most-respected names have repeatedly warned the U.S. could be headed for a repeat of the stagflationary 1970s.\nEven JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has suggested on multiple occasions that stagflation could make a comeback, with his latest warning coming at AllianceBernstein’s Strategic Decisions conference just last week. Dimon didn’t outright predict a repeat of the toxic combination of high inflation and anemic economic growth that was last seen in the U.S. in the 1970s at the conference, but he said he believes the odds of a nightmare stagflationary scenario are “much higher” than most experts appreciate.\n“I look at the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus that has taken place over the last five years—it has been so extraordinary, how can you tell me it won’t lead to stagflation?”\n“It might not,” he said. “But I, for one, am quite prepared for it.”\nNow though, Henry Allen, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank, is pushing back on the 1970s narrative. “In recent weeks, we’ve started to see increasing comparisons with the early 1950s and today,” he explained in a Tuesday note to clients.\nAllen noted that both today’s economy and the economy of the 1950s featured a strong labor market, steadily rising stock prices, increasing geopolitical tensions, and a short-lived surge in inflation.\n“Time will tell if the early-1950s offer a good parallel, but if these similarities do hold, there could be a lot of scope for optimism,” the strategist said. “The good news is that the early 1950s were a period of decent economic and productivity growth.”\nWhen most Americans think of the 1950s, they don’t think of inflation. The post-war era is often romanticized as a period of economic and social stability; it’s even been labeled the “Golden Age of Capitalism” by some. In many ways, this golden era economic narrative holds true, but just like the 2020s, the 1950s was also a decade of challenges—and they began with a wave of Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation.\n“U.S. inflation spiked from late-1950 into 1951. At its peak in February 1951, CPI inflation peaked at 9.4%,” Allen noted. “That’s a very similar peak to today, when CPI inflation rose to 9.1% in June 2022.”\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nAfter this initial surge of consumer prices in 1950 and 1951, caused in part by the start of the Korean War, inflation fell throughout the rest of the 1950s, however. It’s a pattern that is “a closer parallel” to the 2020s, than the 1970s, according to Allen. “So far, we haven’t seen the sort of persistence that occurred in the 1970s, when CPI inflation remained above 4% for almost a decade,” he said.\nInstead, in the 2020s, after hitting its 9.1% peak in June 2022, inflation has fallen substantially, hitting 3.4% in April.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nThe labor market was the powerhouse of the U.S. economy for much of the 1950s. The unemployment rate averaged roughly 4.5% during the decade, and hit a low of just 2.5% in 1953. Now, even with stubborn inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions weighing on consumers and businesses, the 2020’s economy is walking a similar path, moving in on a more than 70-year-old labor market record.\nAllen noted that if Friday's jobs report shows the unemployment rate remained under 4% in May, it would mark the longest stretch of below-4% unemployment since the early 1950s, when the economy saw a 35-month period of sub-4% unemployment.\nThe stock market’s meteoric rise since 2020 is another undeniable parallel between the 1950s and the 2020s. Between January 1950 and the end of 1954, the S&P 500 more than doubled, rising 100 to 225, despite a brief recession caused partly by the decline in military spending following the end of the Korean war.\nSimilarly, between the beginning of 2020 and today, the S&P 500 has soared more than 62%, even after a brief, pandemic-induced drop in March 2020 and multiple wars abroad. And while the stock market’s performance in the 2020s hasn’t been as impressive as it was in the early 1950s, it definitely doesn’t look like the 1970s. Between January 1970 and the end of 1974, the S&P 500 sank 45%.\nGeopolitical tensions were a major feature of the 1950s, just like they are today, as the staunchly capitalist U.S. sought the “global containment” of communism after World War 2, while the Soviet Union attempted to spread its own ideology. This war of economic and political systems manifested in ongoing tensions between the world’s superpowers, a persistent threat of nuclear war, and even helped spark the Korean War.\nIt was a time of “heightened geopolitical risk,” Allen noted, explaining that “this was in the early phase of the Cold War, when there were major tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and those tensions were evident in several regions.”\nSimilarly, today, the global economy is facing a persistent threat from ongoing conflicts in  Ukraine and Israel. These battles have routinely caused issues for businesses and consumers in recent years, precipitating a global oil and natural gas price spike in 2022, and spurring a shipping crisis in the Red Sea more recently.\nDespite the many similarities between the 1950s and the 2020s, Allen noted that there are also a few key differences, and said “we shouldn't exaggerate the comparison.”\nFirst, the strategist pointed out that U.S. government debt is surging now, while it was heading in the other direction in the 1950s. “There was still a major deleveraging taking place after WWII, with the U.S. government debt burden falling substantially. That is very different to today's environment, where the public debt-to-GDP ratio has been on an upward trend over recent decades,” he wrote.\nTo his point, after soaring to a peak of 119% in 1946 after World War 2, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio sank dramatically during the 1950s, from 85% at the beginning of the decade to just 53% by 1960.\nOn the other hand, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio topped 121%, slightly above its post-World War 2 high. And the Congressional Budget Office expects that figure to rise to 166% by 2054.\nThe second key difference between the 1950s and the 2020s lies in birth rates. Allen noted that birth rates surged in the 1950s, leading to the “baby boomers” nickname of the generation that was born in that post-World War era.\n“This was a very favorable trend economically, as it meant there was an expanding cohort of younger workers that would enter the labor force over subsequent decades,” he wrote. “By contrast today, birth rates have been declining and the U.S. population is aging.”\nIn 1955, the U.S. fertility rate—the number of children that would be born to a woman if she lived to the end of her childbearing years—was 3.42. Today, that number has been nearly cut in half to just 1.79.\nSome experts also pointed to stubborn inflation and decelerating GDP growth as evidence that stagflation could be on its way earlier this year. CPI inflation has been stuck in a range between 3% and 3.5% for nearly a year now, and GDP growth sank from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to just 1.6% in the first quarter of this year.\n“I’m starting to get whiffs of stagflation, dare I say…I know that’s a dirty word in a lot of circles,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Bloomberg when discussing these numbers in late April.\nHowever, Bank of America economists came out against the Stagflation narrative in a May 16 note to clients, backing up the view of Deutsche Bank’s Allen. They argued the economy isn’t likely to slow soon, despite more persistent inflation, due to the strength of the U.S. consumer.\n“After the miss on 1Q GDP growth and continued upside surprises on inflation, the \"stagflation\" narrative has resurfaced. We push back,” economist Aditya Bhava wrote, noting there is evidence of “robust” consumer demand in the economy, particularly in the services sector, that should prevent economic stagnation.\nFor Allen, the key to avoiding 1970s-style stagflation is improving labor market productivity—and he believes the economy has the potential to do just that. U.S. labor market productivity has had a renaissance over the past year, rising 2.7% after a nearly two decade period of pain where annual productivity growth averaged just 1.5%.\n“Indeed, there are reasons to believe that can continue,” Allen said. “Low unemployment is often a spur to productivity growth, because firms don’t have the ability to hire from a large group of unemployed workers. As such, this incentivises them to invest more in new technologies, and to help their existing staff become more productive.”\nThe Deutsche Bank strategist pointed to emerging technologies, including AI, as a potential catalyst for U.S. productivity growth as well, arguing “this suggests there could well be some upside risk to economic growth over the years ahead.”\nRising productivity could help combat inflation by reducing unit labor costs as well. “If this happens, then it becomes more likely we can avoid a period like the 1970s, when inflation was persistent,” Allen said.\nOverall, the economy—and stock market—should perform well if we see a repeat of the 1950s, rather than the 1970s, according to Allen. But he also had a warning for investors: no era is exactly alike.\n“Demographic trends are much less favorable, whilst the U.S. national debt is on an upward trajectory. So both those differences could present important headwinds to growth over the years ahead, which weren't experienced in the early 1950s,” he wrote.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 30 Largest Economies in the World by 2075 and in this article we will look at the country that's expected to be the largest in 2075.\nAccording to research by Goldman Sachs, the global potential growth is expected to slow, largely due to slower labor force growth and projections suggest that global growth will average just under 3% annually and continue on a declining path. The global population growth has halved from 2% per year to less than 1% over the past five decades, and it is expected to fall to nearly zero by 2075. Despite a slowdown in real GDP growth for both developed and emerging economies, emerging markets, particularly in Asia, are projected to continue outpacing developed markets. By 2050, the five largest economies in the world are expected to be China, the United States, India, Indonesia, and Germany. You can also take a look at the Top 20 Largest Economies in the World by 2050.\nThe US is unlikely to perform exceptionally due to significantly lower potential growth compared to large emerging economies. The potential growth of the US is expected to remain significantly lower than large emerging economies such as China and India. The appreciation of the Dollar elevated the value of the US economy, which has pushed it significantly above its purchasing power parity-based fair value, but the Dollar's strength is expected to diminish over the next 10 years, suggesting a likely depreciation. Nigeria, Pakistan, and Egypt could also be among the world's largest economies by 2075 if appropriate policies are implemented. Globalization has significantly reduced income inequality between countries and emerging markets have led to a more equal distribution of global incomes and global income inequality has decreased over the past two decades, however, income inequality within countries has risen, posing a challenge to the future of globalization.\nGoldman Sachs' research also discussed the potential challenges for global economic growth and income convergence. First is the risk that populist nationalism could lead to increased protectionism and a reversal of globalization. Populist nationalists have risen to power in several countries and have affected globalization. However, the risk of a reversal remains evident. Secondly the risk of environmental catastrophe due to climate change. Many countries have successfully decoupled economic growth from carbon emissions, demonstrating that this is achievable on a global scale. However, achieving sustainable growth will require economic sacrifices and a globally coordinated response, both of which present significant political challenges.\nFor the years 2070-2079, emerging economies are forecasted to grow at 2.3% and will continue to outstrip developed economies due to productivity growth of only 1.1%. Asia will remain the fastest-growing region with 2.0% growth, however, the Chinese economy is projected to observe one of the highest decelerations. Growth in Latin American economies is forecasted at 1.9% and is expected to grow gradually and accelerate over the next 10 years before decelerating once again in the outer decades. Growth in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa is expected to remain relatively stable at 3.2%, due to an increasing contribution from African economies.\nCompanies play a significant role as primary economic engines for economies around the world. PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) also known as Pinduoduo Inc. is a prominent Chinese company driving economic growth. PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) multinational commerce group that owns and operates a portfolio of businesses including Pinduoduo, which is an innovative e-commerce platform that connects consumers directly with small-scale farmers and offers a network of sourcing, logistics, and fulfillment services. The company also focuses on training farmers and modernizing farming practices. PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) also operates Temu, an online marketplace that connects consumers with millions of merchandise partners, manufacturers, and brands. Temu operates in several countries including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Europe, South Korea, and South Africa.\nOn May 22, PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) reported that its revenue for the first quarter ended on March 31, 2024, increased 131% to $12.02 billion compared to the previous year,  The company’s operating profit also increased by 275% to $3.94 billion, mainly due to an increase in fulfillment and payment processing fees. PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) forecasts a robust revenue growth of 71% for Pinduoduo in 2024, and a further 29% in 2025. The company focuses on long-term growth and invested $403.0 million in research and development for the modernization of agriculture and supply chain thereby reducing its costs. The company has $33.31 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.\nWhile projections indicate a slowing global growth trajectory, emerging markets, particularly in Asia, are shifting the balance in global economic power.\nAn expansive view of the cityscape, showing the impact of the company's activities in China.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the 30 largest economies in the world by 2075, we consulted 'Economics in the Year 2100' by Fathom Consulting, which provides data for the estimated percentage share of countries in the global GDP in 2100 and the GDP PPP of the top ten economies. We utilized the data for the GDP PPP of the top countries and percentage share to determine the total global GDP value in 2075. Our calculation yielded that the global GDP is projected to be approximately $324.34 trillion by 2075. After determining the global GDP in US dollars, we estimated the GDP PPP for the other countries to provide insight into their projected values. We also used the population projections for 2075, by the United Nations. Our list ranks the 30 largest economies in the world by 2075 in ascending order of their GDP forecast in 2075.\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "title": "Jamie Dimon believes U.S. public debt is the ‘most predictable crisis’ the economy faces—and yet in just 3 months America has added $2.1 trillion to its tab",
        "date": "2024-06-21T11:05:37.000Z",
        "article_content": "America’s public debt problem is no longer an issue which can be swept under the rug: Everyone from Wall Street veteran Jamie Dimon to Fed Chair Jerome Powell is sounding the alarm.\nBut while some of the most influential figures in the economy are calling for an action plan, the government has continued to spend at a rate which will add $2.1 trillion to the country’s bill by 2034.\nThat’s according to the latest report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). In February the CBO said its predicted deficit for the year was $1.5 trillion, growing to $2.6 trillion by 2034.\nHowever in a report released this week the CBO wrote: “In CBO’s current projections, the deficit for 2024 is $400 billion (or 27%) larger than it was in the agency’s February 2024 projections, and the cumulative deficit over the 2025–2034 period is larger by $2.1 trillion (10%).”\nCurrently America’s national debt stands at $34.7 trillion—though the figure itself is not what has so many economists worried. Instead, experts are concerned about America’s debt-to-GDP ratio, which indicates how much the country owes versus what it produces and thus, how able it is to pay it back.\nThe CBO didn’t have stellar news on that account either. It reported debt held by the public will rise from 99% of GDP this year to 122% by 2034—surpassing its previous high of 106% in 1946, at the end of the Second World War.\nAnd war is, once again, one of the major factors contributing to America’s ongoing outlays. The CBO adds: “The largest contributor to the cumulative increase was the incorporation of recently enacted legislation … which added $1.6 trillion to projected deficits.\n“That legislation included emergency supplemental appropriations that provided $95 billion for aid to Ukraine, Israel, and countries in the Indo-Pacific region.”\nOn top of the initial legislative hit is the ongoing funding obligations America is legally required to uphold, boosting outlays by $900 billion through to 2034.\nWhile financial support to nations at war forms a chunk of the increase between the February 2024 projection and this month’s, other obligations form the crux of America’s tab.\nWhat the CBO defines as mandatory spending includes the likes of Medicare and Social Security, as well as defense spending and unemployment compensation. The CBO wrote: “The aging of the population causes the number of beneficiaries of Social Security and Medicare to grow faster than the overall population. In addition, federal costs per beneficiary for the major health care programs continue to rise faster than GDP per person.\n“As a result of those two trends, outlays for Social Security and Medicare increase in relation to GDP from 2024 to 2034.”\nExperts remain divided on how much of an issue public debt will prove to be—and it comes down to how necessary they believe the spending is, and their outlook for the economy moving forward.\nThose on the bullish end are hopeful that an uptick in economic growth will offset the debt and interest payments in future. They also add that the vast majority of spending in recent years—under various political parties—has been absolutely critical for the country to navigate the likes of the coronavirus pandemic.\nOn the matter of economic growth, the CBO disagrees with this outlook. In its June update the nonpartisan organization wrote it expects the economy to grow more slowly in calendar years 2024 and 2025 than it grew in 2023, averaging roughly 1.8% between 2026 and 2034.\nOn the more cautious side of the argument are those who, while conscious of the nature of spending in recent years, want to see administrations exercise more restraint—or at least set out a plan for how they will curb outlays in the future.\nAmong those is JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Earlier this year at an event at the Bipartisan Policy Center, Ryan described the debt spiral as the “most predictable crisis we’ve ever had,” which Dimon heartily agreed with.\nLikewise, professor Joao Gomes, vice dean of research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, has long warned of the “severe and ... probably irreversible scars on our economy and society” if federal spending continues unchecked.\nPrior to appearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget in April, professor Gomes told Fortune: “It could derail the next administration, frankly. If they come up with plans for large tax cuts or another big fiscal stimulus, the markets could rebel. Interest rates could just spike right there, and we would have a crisis in 2025. It could very well happen. I’m very confident by the end of the decade one way or another, we will be there.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-04-29T11:44:09.000Z",
        "article_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Since retiring two years ago, Joan Harris has upped her travel game.\nOnce or twice a year, she visits her two adult children in different states. She's planning multiple other trips, including to a science fiction convention in Scotland and a Disney cruise soon after that, along with a trip next year to neolithic sites in Great Britain.\n“I really have more money to spend now than when I was working,” said Harris, 64, an engineer who worked 29 years for the federal government and lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nBack then, she and her now-ex-husband were paying for their children's college educations and piling money into savings accounts. Now, she's splurging a bit and, for the first time, is willing to pay for first-class plane tickets. She plans to fly business class to Scotland and has arranged for a higher-level suite on the cruise.\n“I suddenly realized, with my dad getting old and my mom dying, it’s like, ‘No, you can’t take it with you,’ ” she said. “I could become incapacitated to the point where I couldn’t enjoy something like going to Scotland or going on a cruise. So I better do it, right?”\nOlder Americans like Harris are fueling a sustained boost to the U.S. economy. Benefiting from outsize gains in the stock and housing markets over the past several years, they are accounting for a larger share of consumer spending — the principal driver of economic growth — than ever before.\nAnd much of their spending is going toward higher-priced services like travel, health care and entertainment, putting further upward pressure on those prices — and on inflation. Such spending is relatively immune to the Federal Reserve's push to slow growth and tame inflation through higher borrowing rates, because it rarely requires borrowing.\nAffluent older Americans, if they own government bonds, may even be benefiting from the Fed's rate hikes. Those hikes have led to higher bond yields, generating more income for those who own such bonds.\nThe so-called “wealth effect,\" whereby rising home and stock values give people confidence to increase their spending, is a big reason why the economy has defied expectations of a sharp slowdown. Its unexpected strength, which is contributing to stickier inflation, has forced a shift in the Fed's plans.\nAs recently as March, the Fed's policymakers had projected that they would cut their benchmark rate three times this year. Since then, though, inflation measures have remained uncomfortably high, partly a consequence of brisk consumer spending. Chair Jerome Powell made clear recently that the Fed isn't confident enough that inflation is sustainably easing to cut rates.\nWhen the Fed meets this week, it is sure to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at a 23-year high, the result of 11 rate hikes. The Fed's hikes have forced up borrowing costs across the economy — for everything from home and auto loans to credit cards and business loans.\nEven as the Fed has jacked up borrowing costs, stock and home values have kept rising, enlarging the net worth of affluent households. Consider that household wealth grew by an average of 5.5% a year in the decade after the 2008-2009 Great Recession but that since 2018, it's accelerated to nearly 9%.\nStock prices, as measured by the S&P 500 index, are about 72% higher than they were five years ago. Home values soared 58% from the end of 2018 through 2023, according to the Federal Reserve.\nAll told, Americans’ wealth has ballooned from $98 trillion at the end of 2018 to $147 trillion five years later. Adjusting for inflation, the gains are less dramatic, but still substantial.\n“People have had significant wealth gains in stocks, significant wealth gains in fixed income, significant wealth gains in home prices, significant wealth gains even in crypto,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at the Apollo Group, an asset manager. “All that adds up to still a very significant tailwind.”\nThe gains are hardly universal. The wealthiest one-tenth of Americans own two-thirds of all household wealth. Still, wealth for the median household — the midpoint between the richest and poorest — rose 37% from 2019 to 2022, the sharpest rise on record since the 1980s according to the Fed, to $193,000.\nWealth is also disproportionately held by older Americans. People ages 55 and over now own nearly three-quarters of all household wealth, up from 68% in 2010, according to the Fed. In percentage terms since the pandemic, household net worth has also surged for younger households. But because younger adults started from a much lower level, their gains haven't been anywhere near enough to keep pace with older Americans.\n“The baby boomers are the richest retiring generation we’ve ever had,” said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. “Not everybody is well-off, but we've never had a retiring generation with this much wealth. That’s one of the major reasons why the economy is strong.\"\nThat said, many older Americans face significant financial challenges. One-quarter of Americans over age 50 have no retirement savings, according to a survey by the AARP.\nEven so, as the huge baby boom generation has aged and, on average, has accumulated more assets, they have accounted for a rising share of consumer spending. Americans ages 65 or over supplied nearly 22% of consumer spending in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available. That's the highest such figure on records dating to 1989, up from about 16% in 2010.\nOne result of the Fed's higher rates has been a kind of bifurcated economy, by age. Older, wealthier Americans who already own homes and cars have been much less affected by the Fed's rate hikes. By contrast, younger Americans are enduring a combination of expensive home prices and high mortgage rates, making it much harder to buy a first home.\nHarris, for one, sees this divide in her own family: Her home and car are paid off, and higher interest rates have had little effect on her finances. She recently visited a home in her neighborhood that she was surprised to see priced at $500,000. She bought hers, which she thinks could fetch a higher price, for $162,000 in 1991.\nHer 25-year-old daughter, Ruby, had a vastly different experience during a recent visit to an open house near her boyfriend's apartment in the Boston area. An older two-bedroom apartment was on sale for $800,000; it sold within a week.\nRuby considers herself fortunate to have a well-paying job as a materials engineer. But that apartment price still seemed astronomical. She loves the area, especially for its walkability, but doubts she'll ever be able to afford a house there.\n“In the long term, it probably won’t be affordable to stay here,\" she said. \"Whereas the Midwest is more affordable but won’t have the neighborhoods that I like.”\nEconomists calculate that while the wealth effect generally has a relatively modest effect on spending, it may be larger now. That's because retirement-age Americans, who are more likely to spend out of their wealth, constitute a larger proportion of the nation: Americans ages 65 and over make up about 17% of the population, up from 13% in 2010. And people with stock holdings can now easily access their account balances online, increasing their awareness of increases in their net worth.\nResearch by Michael Brown, an economist at Visa and others has also found that significant stock market wealth typically boosts spending on discretionary items such as restaurants, travel and entertainment — sectors of the economy where spending is surging and inflation remains elevated.\nThe Conference Board, a business research group, asks Americans in its monthly survey of consumer confidence whether they plan an overseas vacation in the next six months. Slok noted that more than one in five households say they are — a record-high proportion on records dating to 1967.\nThe cruise provider Royal Caribbean just reported blowout earnings and strong demand, “leading to higher pricing for all our key products,\" CEO Jason Liberty told investors. “Customer sentiment remains very positive, bolstered by resilient labor markets, wage growth, stabilizing inflation and record-high household net worth.\"\nLast week, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, excluding volatile food and energy costs, rose 2.8% from a year earlier, a sign that inflation remains sticky. Solid consumer spending, particularly on services, was one key factor. In one measure of services inflation that the Fed watches closely, prices climbed 3.5% from a year earlier, far higher than is consistent with its 2% inflation target."

        "date": "2024-09-25T08:51:21.000Z",
        "article_content": "The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how gig economy stocks fared in Q2, starting with Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT).\nThe iPhone changed the world, ushering in the era of the “always-on” internet and “on-demand” services - anything someone could want is just a few taps away. Likewise, the gig economy sprang up in a similar fashion, with a proliferation of tech-enabled freelance labor marketplaces, which work hand and hand with many on demand services. Individuals can now work on demand too. What began with tech enabled platforms that aggregated riders and drivers has expanded over the past decade to include food delivery, groceries, and now even a plumber or graphic designer are all just a few taps away.\nThe 6 gig economy stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 4.3% below.\nBig picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled.\nLuckily, gig economy stocks have performed well with share prices up 24.9% on average since the latest earnings results.\nFounded by Logan Green and John Zimmer as a long-distance intercity carpooling company Zimride, Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) operates a ridesharing network in the US and Canada.\nLyft reported revenues of $1.44 billion, up 40.6% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 3.6%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with exceptional revenue growth and solid growth in its users.\n“For over a year you've heard us say that customer obsession drives profitable growth,\" said CEO David Risher.\nLyft scored the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth of the whole group. The company reported 23.7 million users, up 10.3% year on year. Unsurprisingly, the stock is up 20.3% since reporting and currently trades at $13.20.\nIs now the time to buy Lyft?

The business had a strong quarter with solid growth in its requests and a decent beat of analysts’ request estimates.\nThe market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 33.1% since reporting. It currently trades at $144.10.\nIs now the time to buy DoorDash?

It was a softer quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ buyer estimates.\nFiverr delivered the highest full-year guidance raise but had the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. The company reported 3.89 million active buyers, down 7.9% year on year. Interestingly, the stock is up 19.5% since the results and currently trades at $26.19.\nRead our full analysis of Fiverr’s results here. \nBorn out of a winter night thought: \"What if you could request a ride from your phone?\" Uber (NYSE: UBER) operates a global network of on demand services, most prominently ride hailing and food delivery, and freight.\nUber reported revenues of $10.7 billion, up 15.9% year on year. This print topped analysts’ expectations by 1%. More broadly, it was an impressive quarter as it also produced strong growth in its users but slow revenue growth.\nThe company reported 156 million users, up 13.9% year on year.

This print met analysts’ expectations. However, it was a strong quarter as it recorded a miss of analysts’ gmv estimates and underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter.\nUpwork had the weakest full-year guidance update among its peers.

        "date": "2024-12-30T17:22:53.000Z",
        "article_content": "Brace yourself, investorsU.S. credit card defaults are climbing at a rate we haven't seen since 2010, signaling cracks in consumer financial stability. Credit card lenders have already written off $46 billion in delinquent loans in 2024, a 50% leap over last year, according to BankRegData. That's a big red flag for the bottom third of U.S. consumers, whose savings rate is now a shocking zero, per Moody's Analytics chief Mark Zandi. Meanwhile, Capital One (NYSE:COF) just revealed that its annualized credit card write-off rate hit 6.1% in November, up from 5.2% a year ago. Translation? Borrowers are struggling, and lenders are bracing for impact.\nHere's what's fueling this storm: post-pandemic spending splurges, ballooning credit card balances, and interest rates that just won't quit. Federal Reserve data shows credit card debt surpassed $5.1 trillion in October, while Americans shelled out $170 billion in interest payments over the last year. Low-income households, the hardest hit, have burned through their savings, leaving many to rely on credit cards just to get by. And the hits keep comingWalletHub's Odysseas Papadimitriou warns that delinquency rates remain alarmingly high, with $37 billion in overdue balances still haunting lenders' books. Throw in rising borrowing costs and potential inflationary pressures in 2025, and it's clear we're not out of the woods yet.\nFor investors, this is a double-edged sword. On one side, watch financial heavyweights like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) closely as they gear up to report Q4 earnings; their exposure to these write-offs could be a canary in the coal mine. On the other, shifting consumer behavior toward frugality might hit retail and discretionary stocks hard. The takeaway? Pay attention to the trends in delinquencies and write-offsthey're the tea leaves for what's ahead in the broader economy.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus."

        "article_content": "Despite a booming U.S. economy and significant advancements in the tech sector, including a robust performance by companies like Nvidia Corp. and a thriving artificial intelligence (AI) industry, tech companies have continued to lay off workers at an alarming rate in 2024.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq index has shown an impressive uptick and the U.S. economy added 353,000 jobs in January, outpacing economists’ forecasts. However, this overall economic strength masks a wave of layoffs in the tech sector, underscoring a disconnect between the broader economy and the challenges in the tech industry.\nDon't Miss:\nA groundbreaking energy company plugs into the $400 billion EV industry and is seeking investors.\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?\nIn 2024, the tech sector has already seen layoffs outpace those of the previous year, with over 42,324 tech employees laid off, averaging more than 780 layoffs each day. This follows nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, indicating a continued trend of job cuts within the industry. Major companies like Google, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp, Discord, Salesforce Inc., eBay Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. have all announced significant layoffs in January, despite the broader economic growth and job additions in other sectors​​​​.\nSeveral factors contribute to this paradoxical situation. First, the rapid rise of AI necessitates significant investment in new technologies, leading companies to reallocate resources and trim their workforce.\nTrending: This startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head.\nThe stock market’s response has also played a role; companies that have announced layoffs have often seen their stock prices increase, suggesting investor approval of efforts to streamline operations and focus on profitability. This trend is compounded by pressure from Wall Street, which, following a significant sell-off of tech stocks in 2022, has pushed companies to improve their bottom lines by cutting costs, including workforce reductions​​​​.\nThe tech sector’s layoffs reflect a strategic shift toward efficiency and profitability, with companies reevaluating their workforce in light of post-pandemic operational needs and the integration of AI into their business models. Despite the layoffs, the demand for AI-related roles is expected to grow, albeit at a smaller scale, as companies continue to prioritize investments in this area​​.\nThis ongoing wave of layoffs, despite a supposedly booming economy, has significantly impacted the tech workforce, leading to job insecurity and a reevaluation of career paths in the industry. The narrative of tech as a stable and lucrative career choice is being challenged, pushing many to consider alternative employment opportunities or even career changes​​.\nIn summary, the tech industry’s current state underscores a complex interplay of economic growth, technological advancement and the reconfiguration of the workforce. While the broader U.S. economy shows signs of strength, the tech sector’s continued layoffs highlight the unique challenges and transitions facing one of the most dynamic industries in the global market.\nRead Next:\nFortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Despite Booming Economy And Record Profits Google, Amazon, Microsoft And More Lay Off Over 42,000 So Far In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "article_content": "WASHINGTON, Dec. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- After a strong performance in 2024, the U.S. economy will continue to benefit from a solid labor market, rising household wealth, and resilient consumer spending next year according to the 2025 Equipment Leasing & Finance U.S. Economic Outlook. Real equipment and software investment growth is projected to be 4.7% in 2025, roughly on par with growth in 2024 with stronger investment activity expected in the latter half of the year. The report, which was prepared by Keybridge and released today by the Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, also forecasts real GDP growth of 2.7% next year, similar to the estimated 2.8% growth observed in 2024.\nThe Foundation's report is focused on the $1.3 trillion equipment leasing and finance industry, and highlights key trends in equipment investment, placing them in the context of the broader U.S. economic climate.\nLeigh Lytle, President of the Foundation, and President & CEO of the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association, said, “The economy blew past expectations in 2024 as strong consumer spending and business investment pushed growth above trends experienced prior to the pandemic. Data on new loan volume from ELFA’s CapEx Finance Index and executive sentiment in the Foundation’s Monthly Confidence Index suggest that momentum carried through to the fourth quarter, and lines the economy up for a strong 2025. That said, the potential for a trade war and persistent inflation could cause the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of rate decreases, which would weigh on the U.S. economy. Time will tell how all of these things shake out, but if we’ve learned one thing from 2024, it’s to never bet against the strength of American consumers or the resiliency of American business.”\nHighlights from the 2025 Outlook include:\nEquipment and software investment expanded 7.5% (annualized) in Q3, the second consecutive quarter of solid growth. Aircraft investment, which has more than doubled since Q1, was again primarily responsible for the strong performance. Growth in computers and communication equipment has also been strong, while construction machinery investment contracted again.\nThe U.S. economy continues to outperform its international peers. Despite the unprecedented downturn in early 2020, the U.S. economy is roughly 11% larger in inflation-adjusted terms than it was at the end of 2019, faring far better than other major economies. Businesses are more optimistic about their prospects in 2025, in part due to the prospects of lower taxes and less regulation under the incoming Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress. However, uncertainty remains regarding potential tariffs, tax cuts for manufacturers, and changes to clean energy funding.\nLooking to Fed policy, the December employment report confirmed that the labor market remains generally healthy, with 227K jobs created in November and upward revisions to the previous two months’ data. These data align with Fed Chair Jay Powell’s description of recent economic performance as “remarkably good” and “not sending any signals [for] the need to be in a hurry to lower rates.” Nonetheless, markets overwhelmingly predict another rate cut at the Fed’s December 18th meeting. In 2025, FOMC members will closely monitor upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment.\nThe Foundation-Keybridge U.S. Equipment & Software Investment Momentum Monitor, which is released in conjunction with the Economic Outlook, tracks 12 equipment and software investment verticals. In addition, the Momentum Monitor Sector Matrix provides a customized data visualization of current values of each of the 12 verticals based on recent momentum and historical strength. This month two verticals are expanding, two are peaking, four are recovering, and four are weakening. Over the next three to six months the Foundation expects the following trends to materialize on a year-over-year basis: \nAgriculture machinery investment growth is likely to weaken further.\nConstruction machinery investment growth is expected to remain weak.\nMaterials handling equipment investment growth will remain positive and could strengthen.\nAll other industrial equipment investment growth will remain weak.\nMedical equipment investment growth should stay positive.\nMining and oilfield machinery investment growth should improve.\nAircraft investment growth may have peaked and is likely to decline.\nShips and boats investment growth is expected to remain in contractionary territory.\nRailroad equipment investment growth may weaken but should remain positive.\nTrucks investment growth will be weak or negative.\nComputers investment growth should remain strong.\nSoftware investment growth will remain positive, but this month’s sizable momentum decline is worth monitoring in the months ahead.\nThe Foundation produces the Equipment Leasing & Finance U.S. Economic Outlook report in partnership with economic and public policy consulting firm Keybridge Research. The annual economic forecast provides the U.S. macroeconomic outlook, credit market conditions, and key economic indicators. The report will be updated quarterly throughout 2025.\nDownload the full report at https://www.leasefoundation.org/industry-resources/u-s-economic-outlook/.\nDownload the Momentum Monitor at https://www.leasefoundation.org/industry-resources/momentum-monitor/.\nAll Foundation studies are available for free download from the Foundation’s online library at http://store.leasefoundation.org/.\nJOIN THE CONVERSATIONX/Twitter: https://twitter.com/LeaseFoundationLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/10989281/Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/elffchannel\nABOUT THE FOUNDATIONThe Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation is a 501c3 non-profit organization that propels the equipment finance sector—and its people—forward through industry-specific knowledge, intelligence, and student talent development programs that contribute to industry innovation, individual careers, and the advancement of the equipment leasing and finance industry.

        "article_content": "New Global Wellness Institute research reveals a wellness market with relentless momentum, worth 26% more than it was pre-pandemic. The wellness industry is now roughly four times larger than the global pharmaceutical industry ($1.6 trillion) and nearly 60% as big as all consumer health expenditures ($10.6 trillion)\nMIAMI, Nov. 5, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Numerous global surveys have found that wellness matters more to people each year post pandemic. With today's release of the Global Wellness Institute's (GWI) Global Wellness Economy Monitor 2024, there are hard numbers to prove it. The research finds that the wellness market grew from $4.6 trillion in 2020 to $5.8 trillion in 2022, and reached a record $6.3 trillion by the end of 2023 (9% annual growth). Wellness continues to expand its share of the overall economy, now representing over 6% of global GDP, up from 5.75% in 2019.\nWellness markets across every global region have seen strong growth from 2019 to 2023, with North America, Europe, and Middle East-North Africa recording the biggest gains. Market sizes in nine of the 11 wellness sectors have significantly exceeded their 2019 levels (only thermal/mineral springs and workplace wellness have not yet fully recovered, but will in 2024). The sectors with the most powerful annual growth rates from 2019 to 2023 are: 1) wellness real estate (18.1%), 2) public health, prevention and personalized medicine (15.2%), and 3) mental wellness (11.6%). To provide some context on the major impact that wellness is having on the world economy, GWI researchers compared it to other vast global industries, finding it's much larger than the pharmaceutical industry, sports, IT, tourism, and the green economy.\nBecause the trends fueling the wellness economy will only accelerate—an aging population, chronic disease, widespread mental unwellness—the GWI predicts that the industry will grow a rapid 7.3% annually from 2023 to 2028, when it will represent 6.8% of global GDP. The market will reach nearly $6.8 trillion in 2024 and nearly $9 trillion in 2028 (nearly double its 2019 size).\nWellness Market Size––2017-2028\n2017: $4.5 trillion 2019: $5 trillion 2020: $4.6 trillion 2021: $5.4 trillion 2022: $5.8 trillion 2023: $6.3 trillion––Growth rate from 2019-2023: 5.9% CAGR 2028: $9 trillion––Projected growth rate from 2023-2028: 7.3% CAGR\n\"The wellness economy continues to march forward at a brisk pace, despite a decline in global wellbeing on many fronts,\" said Katherine Johnston and Ophelia Yeung, GWI senior researchers. \"In a world full of uncertainty and divisiveness, wellness has become a universal value. No matter your politics or beliefs, who doesn't desire the knowledge, tools, and opportunities to build a healthy life for yourself and your family?\"\nThe 100-plus-page report is packed with data. It provides new market sizes, recent growth rates, and projections through 2028 for all 11 wellness sectors. It also contains regional data, the top 20 national markets for each sector, and per-capita spending by sector, all while exploring major trends that will impact each segment in the future.\nDownload the full report HERE.

Other Mega Industries––Global Market Size, 2023\nPharmaceutical Industry: $1.6 trillion Sports: $2.65 trillion Tourism: $4.65 trillion Green Economy: $4.8 trillion IT: $5 trillion Wellness Economy: $6.3 trillion All Health Expenditures: $10.6 trillion Manufacturing: $16.2 trillion\nWellness is now a larger market than many global mega-industries, including IT, sports, and pharmaceuticals. In spite of the rapid growth of green/sustainability businesses, the wellness market is more than 30% larger than the green economy ($4.8 billion). A striking stat: the wellness market is now roughly 60% the size of all global health expenditures ($10.6 trillion).\nThe Recent Growth Story:\nNumbers refer to the 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023 market sizes AND avg. annual growth rate from 2019-2023.\nPersonal Care & Beauty: $1T––$944B––$1.1T––$1.2T––+3.1% Healthy Eating, Nutrition & Weight Loss: $912B––$950B––$1T––$1.1T––+4.7% Physical Activity: $904B––$772B––$1T––$1.1T––+4.1% Wellness Tourism: $697B––$343B––$637B––$830B––+4.5% Public Health, Prevention & Personalized Medicine: $444B––$634B––$737B––$781B––+15.2% Traditional & Complementary Medicine: $483B––$452B––$526B––$553B––+3.4% Wellness Real Estate: $225B––$274B––$387B––$438B––+18.1% Mental Wellness: $150B––$163B––$210B––$233B––+11.6% Spas: $116B––$72B––$106B––$137B––+4.1% Thermal/Mineral Springs: $66B––$39B––$49B––$63B––minus 1.2% Workplace Wellness: $52B––$48B––$50B––$52B––minus .02%\nWELLNESS ECONOMY: $5 trillion in 2019––$4.6 trillion in 2020––$5.8 trillion in 2022––$6.3 trillion in 2023. Growth from 2022 to 2023: 9%.\nAll 11 wellness sectors grew from 2021 to 2023. From 2022 to 2023, the sectors with the biggest gains were: 1) wellness tourism (30.3%), 2) spas (29.3%), and 3) thermal/mineral springs (28.7%), a testament to the recent boom in wellness travel, but also reflecting how these sectors suffered the biggest pandemic hits. An even better metric is looking at market growth for each sector since their pre-pandemic level. The top-5 leaders through that lens: 1) wellness real estate (195% of its 2019 level), 2) public health, prevention and personalized medicine (176% of 2019 level), 3) mental wellness (155% of 2019 level), 4) healthy eating, nutrition and weight loss (120% of 2019 level), and 5) wellness tourism (119% of 2019 level).\nWellness real estate has been the growth star before, during and after the pandemic, with consumers and the building industry finally grasping the outsized role that external environments play in our physical and mental health. Also notable: while wellness has historically been a consumer market, the public health, prevention and personalized medicine segment has, since the pandemic, become the fifth largest sector, now accounting for 12.4% of all wellness spending.\nRegional Leaders: Wellness markets in every region have grown since the pandemic, but North America (137% of its 2019 market), Middle East-North Africa (130% of 2019), and Europe (125% of 2019) are the three growth leaders through 2023. The largest regional wellness markets are North America ($2.2 trillion), Asia-Pacific ($1.9 trillion), and Europe ($1.7 trillion), which together account for over 90% of the entire global wellness economy. While Asia-Pacific has a far larger population, per capita wellness spending is much higher in North America ($5,768) and Europe ($1,794) than in Asia and other regions.\nThe Future?

        "date": "2024-08-04T17:17:15.000Z",
        "article_content": "A version of this post first appeared on TKer.co.\nJust because something happened a bunch of times in the past doesn’t mean it must happen again in the future.\nThis is what Fed Chair Jerome Powell communicated when asked about the “Sahm Rule” recession indicator, which has revealed that recessions historically started when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rose 0.5 percentage points or more above its 12-month low.\n“A statistical regularity is what I call it,” Powell said on Wednesday. “It's not like an economic rule, where it's telling you something must happen.”\nClaudia Sahm, the economist whom the indicator is named after, would agree.\n“Indicators of economic downturns like the Sahm rule are empirical regularities from the past, not laws of nature,” Sahm wrote last November.\nOn Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July. This caused the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate to breach that 0.5 percentage point threshold for the first time in this economic cycle.\nSahm has been arguing that her namesake indicator triggering could be a false positive due lingering pandemic-related economic distortions.\n“The Sahm rule is likely overstating the labor market's weakening due to unusual shifts in labor supply caused by the pandemic and immigration,” Sahm recently said.\nAll of this speaks to TKer’s Rule No. 1 of analyzing the economy: Don’t count on the signal of a single metric.\nIt’s a lesson that’s been learned following false positive recession signals from the yield curve and the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index.\nThe economy is complex with countless numbers of moving parts, and sometimes some of those parts will be behaving so abnormally that it will force time-tested indicators to break down.\nFor example, the current economic cycle has come with an unusually high number of job openings: a sign of abnormally strong demand. At its peak in March 2022, there was an unprecedented two job openings per unemployed person.\nOver the past two years, this excess demand for jobs had people controversially believing that it would be possible to bring down inflation without a large rise in unemployment. Because, basically it was those extra job listings that were emboldening workers to press for higher pay, and employers obliged because of booming demand. All the Fed had to do was cool the economy just enough that demand would come down just enough for employers to take down those job listings, the argument went, which in turn would help inflation to come down.\nThis challenged the traditional understanding that falling job openings comes with higher unemployment — a relationship illustrated by the Beveridge curve — and that higher unemployment is needed to bring inflation down — a relationship illustrated by the Phillips curve.\nThis is not to say that the Sahm rule, the Beveridge curve, and the Phllips curve are all useless.\nThe takeaway here is to remember that the economy is complex, and we should keep an eye out for developments that may challenge what have been statistical regularities.\nBut make no mistake: The labor market is cooling\nJust because popular recession indicators are sending false positives doesn’t mean the risk of recession isn’t elevated and that the economy isn’t cooling.\nOn the contrary, economic activity growth has been decelerating significantly, with labor market metrics normalizing.\nThis week we’ve learned that job creation continues to cool, the unemployment rate rose to its highest level since October 2021, and the ratio of job openings to unemployed people fell to a three-year low. The quits rate is also down, initial claims for unemployment insurance are up, wage growth is cooling, and labor market confidence is down. And manufacturers expect further deceleration in hiring. For more details, scroll down to TKer’s weekly review of the macro crosscurrents.\nBroadly speaking, the economy has been looking a lot less “coiled,” with many signs of excess demand fading.\nAll this puts increasing amounts of pressure on the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy to help the economy avoid recession.\nWhile recession may not be the baseline scenario, it’s prudent to remember that they are normal and they can be rough for stocks in the near-term.\nOn Wednesday, CFRA’s Sam Stovall raised his 12-month target for the S&P 500 to 6,145 from 5,610. He noted this implies a year-end level of 5,770. This is his third revision from his initial target.\n“What’s more, CFRA equity analysts’ market cap-weighted 12-month target prices for S&P 500 constituents point to a near-14% potential appreciation for the benchmark in the year ahead,” Stovall said.\nStovall is not alone in tweaking his forecast. His peers at Barclays, RBC, Oppenheimer, Yardeni, Citi, Capital Economics, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, BMO, HSBC, Societe Generale, and BofA are among those who’ve also raised their targets.\nDon’t be surprised to see more of these revisions as the S&P 500’s performance, so far this year, has exceeded many strategists’ expectations.\nThere were a few notable data points and macroeconomic developments from last week to consider:\nFed holds rates steady, sees risks to both inflation and employment. The Federal Reserve announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate target high at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%.\nFrom the Fed’s statement (emphasis added): “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have moderated, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated. In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2% inflation objective. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2% over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.“\nFor a while, the Fed has been primarily concerned with inflation. With labor market metrics now more in balance, the central bank is now also more concerned about rising unemployment.\nThis echoes what Fed Chair Powell said to Congress earlier in July: “Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.“\nThat said, Powell’s language during Wednesday’s press conference suggests a rate cut could be coming soon.\n“The question will be whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market,” Powell told reporters Wednesday. “If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.”\nThat next meeting is scheduled for September 17-18.\nThe labor market continues to add jobs. According to the BLS’s Employment Situation report released Friday, U.S. employers added 114,000 jobs in July. It was the 43rd straight month of gains, reaffirming an economy with robust demand for labor.\nTotal payroll employment is at a record 158.7 million jobs, up 6.4 million from the prepandemic high.\nThe unemployment rate — that is, the number of workers who identify as unemployed as a percentage of the civilian labor force — rose to 4.3% during the month. While it continues to hover near 50-year lows, the metric is now at its highest level since October 2021.\nWage growth cools. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2% month-over-month in July, down from the 0.3% pace in June. On a year-over-year basis, this metric is up 3.6%, the lowest rate since June 2021.\nJob openings fall. According to the BLS’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, employers had 8.18 million job openings in June, down from 8.23 million in May. While this remains elevated above prepandemic levels, it’s down from the March 2022 high of 12.18 million.\nDuring the period, there were 6.81 million unemployed people — meaning there were 1.2 job openings per unemployed person. This continues to be one of the most obvious signs of excess demand for labor. However, it has returned to prepandemic levels.\nLayoffs remain depressed, hiring remains firm. Employers laid off 1.5 million people in June. While challenging for all those affected, this figure represents just 0.9% of total employment. This metric continues to trend below pre-pandemic levels.\nHiring activity continues to be much higher than layoff activity. During the month, employers hired 5.34 million people.\nPeople are quitting less. In June, 3.28 million workers quit their jobs. This represents 2.1% of the workforce, which matches the lowest level since August 2020 and is below the prepandemic trend.\nA low quits rate could mean a number of things: more people are satisfied with their job; workers have fewer outside job opportunities; wage growth is cooling; productivity will improve as fewer people are entering new unfamiliar roles.\nLabor productivity inches up. From the BLS: “Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 2.3% in the second quarter of 2024 … as output increased 3.3 percent and hours worked increased 1.0%. … From the same quarter a year ago, nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 2.7%.\nJob switchers still get better pay. According to ADP, which tracks private payrolls and employs a different methodology than the BLS, annual pay growth in July for people who changed jobs was up 7.8% from a year ago. For those who stayed at their job, pay growth was 4.8%.\nKey labor costs metric cools. The employment cost index in the Q2 2024 was up 0.9% from the prior quarter, down from the 1.2% rate in Q1. This was the hottest print since Q3 2022. On a year-over-year basis, it was up 3.8% in Q2, up modestly from the 3.7% rate in Q1.\nUnemployment claims rise. Initial claims for unemployment benefits increased to 249,000 during the week ending July 27, up from 235,000 the week prior. While this metric continues to trend at levels historically associated with economic growth, the latest print is the highest since August 2023.\nConsumer vibes recovery stalls. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index ticked modestly higher in July. From the firm’s Dana Peterson: “Confidence increased in July, but not enough to break free of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years. Even though consumers remain relatively positive about the labor market, they still appear to be concerned about elevated prices and interest rates, and uncertainty about the future; things that may not improve until next year.”\nMore from Peterson: “Compared to last month, consumers were somewhat less pessimistic about the future. Expectations for future income improved slightly, but consumers remained generally negative about business and employment conditions ahead. Meanwhile, consumers were a bit less positive about current labor and business conditions. Potentially, smaller monthly job additions are weighing on consumers’ assessment of current job availability: while still quite strong, consumers’ assessment of the current labor market situation declined to its lowest level since March 2021.“\nWeak consumer sentiment readings appear to contradict resilient consumer spending data\nConsumers feel less great about the labor market. From The Conference Board’s July Consumer Confidence survey: “Consumers’ appraisal of the labor market deteriorated in July. 34.1% of consumers said jobs were “plentiful,” down from 35.5% in June. 16.0% of consumers said jobs were “hard to get,” up from 15.7%.”\nMany economists monitor the spread between these two percentages (a.k.a., the labor market differential), and it’s been reflecting a cooling labor market.\nFrom Renaissance Macro’s Neil Dutta: “Consumers spot changes in their local economies before the data. The Conference Board’s Labor Differential dropped to 18.1 in July, a fresh cycle low. Consumers are seeing softer labor market conditions and historically this has coincided with a rising unemployment rate.“\nGas prices fall. From AAA: “The national average for a gallon of gas dipped four cents since last week to $3.48. The drop comes as a tropical wave with storm-forming potential is slowly approaching the Caribbean Sea. Should it enter the Gulf of Mexico, expect oil prices to move higher.”\nCard spending data is stable. From JPMorgan: “As of 22 Jul 2024, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 1.5% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 22 Jul 2024, our estimate of the U.S. Census July control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.27%.“\nFrom Bank of America: “Total card spending per HH was up 0.1% y/y in the week ending Jul 27, according to BAC aggregated credit & debit card data. The sectors that saw the largest improvement in spending growth since last week were department stores, transit and lodging. Gas (due to lower gas prices), online electronics and entertainment spending growth declined since last week.”\nHome prices rise. According to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index, home prices rose 0.3% month-over-month in May. From S&P Dow Jones Indices’ Brian Luke: “While annual gains have decelerated recently, this may have more to do with 2023 than 2024, as recent performance remains encouraging. Our home price index has appreciated 4.1% year-to-date, the fastest start in two years. Covering the six-month period dating to when mortgage rates peaked, our national index has risen the past four months, erasing the stall experienced late last year. Collectively, all 20 markets covered continue to trade in a homogeneous pattern. Coming into the 2024 presidential election, traditional red states are in a dead heat with blue states, both averaging 5.9% gains annually.”\nMortgage rates tick lower. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.73% from 6.78% the week prior. From Freddie Mac: “Mortgage rates declined to their lowest level since early February. Expectations of a Fed rate cut coupled with signs of cooling inflation bode well for the market, but apprehension in consumer confidence may prevent an immediate uptick as affordability challenges remain top of mind. Despite this, a recent moderation in home price growth and increases in housing inventory are a welcoming sign for potential homebuyers.”\nThere are 146 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86 million are owner-occupied and 39% of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates.\nManufacturing surveys deteriorate. From S&P Global’s July U.S. Manufacturing PMI: “The manufacturing recovery moved into reverse in July, though the gloomier growth picture was accompanied by a marked cooling of inflation in the goods-producing sector. Business conditions worsened in July as the first fall in new orders since April caused a near-stalling of production. Purchasing activity is falling and hiring has slowed amid concerns over weaker-than-anticipated sales.”\nSimilarly, the ISM’s July Manufacturing PMI signaled contraction in the industry.\nKeep in mind that during times of perceived stress, soft survey data tends to be more exaggerated than hard data.\nConstruction spending ticks lower. Construction spending declined 0.3% to an annual rate of $2.1 trillion in June.\nNear-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 2.5% rate in Q3.\nWe continue to get evidence that we are experiencing a bullish “Goldilocks” soft landing scenario where inflation cools to manageable levels without the economy having to sink into recession.\nThis comes as the Federal Reserve continues to employ very tight monetary policy in its ongoing effort to get inflation under control. While it’s true that the Fed has taken a less hawkish tone in 2023 and 2024 than in 2022, and that most economists agree that the final interest rate hike of the cycle has happened, inflation still has to stay cool for a little while before the central bank is comfortable with price stability.\nSo we should expect the central bank to keep monetary policy tight, which means we should be prepared for relatively tight financial conditions (e.g., higher interest rates, tighter lending standards, and lower stock valuations) to linger. All this means monetary policy will be unfriendly to markets for the time being, and the risk the economy slips into a recession will be relatively elevated.\nAt the same time, we also know that stocks are discounting mechanisms — meaning that prices will have bottomed before the Fed signals a major dovish turn in monetary policy.\nAlso, it’s important to remember that while recession risks may be elevated, consumers are coming from a very strong financial position. Unemployed people are getting jobs, and those with jobs are getting raises.\nSimilarly, business finances are healthy as many corporations locked in low interest rates on their debt in recent years. Even as the threat of higher debt servicing costs looms, elevated profit margins give corporations room to absorb higher costs.\nAt this point, any downturn is unlikely to turn into economic calamity given that the financial health of consumers and businesses remains very strong.\nAnd as always, long-term investors should remember that recessions and bear markets are just part of the deal when you enter the stock market with the aim of generating long-term returns. While markets have recently had some bumpy years, the long-run outlook for stocks remains positive.\nA version of this post first appeared on TKer.co."

        "date": "2024-12-19T17:58:12.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, almost reversing the prior two weeks' increases and suggesting that a gradual labor market slowdown remained in place.\nOther data on Thursday showed the economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter, driven by robust consumer spending. The upbeat reports came a day after the Federal Reserve delivered a third consecutive interest rate cut, but projected only two rate reductions in 2025, citing the economy's continued resilience and still-elevated inflation.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday that the \"downside risks of the labor market do appear to have diminished,\" adding that \"the U.S. economy has just been remarkable, I feel very good about where the economy is.\"\n\"The economy is set to end 2024 on a solid note, which is fortunate since we'll have to contend with heightened policy uncertainty and possibly greater challenges in 2025,\" said Oren Klachkin, financial markets economist at Nationwide.\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 220,000 for the week ended Dec. 14, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 230,000 claims for the latest week. They had increased 27,000 in the prior two weeks. Claims have entered a period of volatility, which could see large swings in the data.\nA range of indicators, including job openings, suggests conditions are much looser than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the labor market is slowing in an orderly fashion.\nA jump in the unemployment rate to 4.3% in July from 3.7% at the start of the year saw the U.S. central bank launching its policy easing cycle with an unusually large half-percentage-point interest rate cut in September.\nThe Fed on Wednesday cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to the 4.25%-4.50% range. In September, the Fed had penciled in four quarter-point rate cuts in 2025.\nThe shallower rate cut path in the latest projections also reflected uncertainty over policies from President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, including tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, which economists have warned would be inflationary.\nThe Fed hiked its policy rate by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023 to tame inflation.\nStocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.\nROBUST CONSUMER SPENDING\nThe claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of December's employment report. Claims rose marginally between the November and December survey periods.\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 227,000 jobs in November, in part boosted by the fading drag from hurricanes and the end of strikes by aerospace factory workers, which had restricted employment growth to 36,000 in October.\nData next week on the number of people on unemployment rolls will shed more light on the labor market's health.\nThe number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, slipped 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.874 million during the week ending Dec. 7, the claims report showed.\nLabor market resilience has been driving the economic expansion through strong consumer spending. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed more momentum in the economy than previously estimated in the third quarter.\nGross domestic product increased at an upwardly revised 3.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of third-quarter GDP. Economic growth was previously reported at a 2.8% pace.\nEconomists had forecast GDP would be unrevised. There was an upgrade to consumer spending while the trade deficit was trimmed, offseting a downward revision to inventory accumulation. The economy grew at a 3.0% pace in the April-June quarter. Its pace of expansion is well above what Fed officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 3.7% pace. That was the fastest in 1-1/2 years and was revised up from the previously estimated 3.5% rate.\n\"It's a bifurcated consumer as high-income households are reaping the benefits of a tight labor market, increases in housing, and stock market wealth,\" said Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics.\n\"Lower-income households remain under financial pressure and, unfortunately, this won't change next year as it will take time for them to adjust to the past inflation shock.\"\nThere were also upgrades to business spending on equipment, intellectual property products and government outlays. But business spending on nonresidential structures like factories was revised down to show a faster pace of decline.\nThe drop in residential investment was not as steep as previously thought. The housing market could be turning around, though higher mortgage rates and prices remain a constraint.\nA measure of domestic demand that excludes government spending, trade and inventories increased at a 3.4% pace.\nFinal sales to private domestic purchasers were previously estimated to have risen at a 3.2% rate. Domestic demand increased at a 2.7% pace in the second quarter.\nNational after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments decreased $15.0 billion, or 0.4% last quarter. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.1% rate last quarter, trimmed from the initially estimated 2.2% pace. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 2.0% rate in the second quarter.\nIn principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data. Annual benchmark revisions tend to narrow the gap between GDP and GDI.\nThe average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.6% rate. That was revised up from the 2.5% rate reported last month. Gross domestic output grew at a 2.5% pace in the April-June quarter.\n\"There are no signs, for now, of economic weakness,\" said Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci)"

        "article_content": "An ongoing US dockworkers strike could cost the economy up to $4.5 billion daily and shave a half percentage point off of US GDP for the fourth quarter, analysts say.\nSome 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen’s Association went on strike Tuesday, temporarily shuttering 36 ports from Maine to Texas. Dockworkers are looking to secure a labor deal with port companies that protects their jobs from automation and raises pay 77% over six years. Negotiations between the union and the US Maritime Alliance, which represents port companies, stalled this summer.\nThe 14 largest ports affected by the strike handle 25% of US goods imports and 27% of exports, worth 2.8% and 1.9% of US GDP, respectively, according to Goldman Sachs. The most impacted US imports are building materials, European wines, and fruits from Latin America — most of which come through East Coast ports, according to data compiled by Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University. For example, more than 80% of fruits imported to the US are shipped through those docks. Meanwhile, cars and auto parts, as well as frozen meats, are among the most affected US exports.\nUsing base estimates from the 2015 West Coast port strikes calculated by the National Retail Federation and the National Association of Manufacturers, JPMorgan analysts said in a recent note that the shutdown could cost the US economy between $3.8 billion and $4.5 billion daily. And even when the strike ends and ports reopen, it could take the economy a while to recoup those costs.\n“It takes three to five days to recover from a one-day shutdown,\" Jonathan Gold, National Retail Federation vice president of supply chain and customs policy, told Yahoo Finance earlier this week. \"If that goes for a week or two weeks, that compounds, and you're looking at months for a potential recovery.\"\nHowever, most Wall Street analysts and economists are in agreement that the strike will have a modest effect on the national economy in the grand scheme of things.\n“The worry is that a major port strike will disrupt supply chains and put upward pressure on goods prices, just as the Fed has finally declared victory against inflation,” wrote Capital Economics analysts Tuesday. “Nevertheless, we think fears around the potential economic impacts are overdone.” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note this week that the strike would only hit economic growth and boost inflation if it is long-lasting.\nRSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas told Yahoo Finance, “There are voices making extreme claims around the labor action that don't ring true with the condition of the US economy.”\nAfter pandemic-era disruptions, US manufacturers and retailers have also become adept at handling supply chain issues.\n“Frequent shocks to supply chains in recent years have left producers more attuned to the risks of running low inventories,” Capital Economics analysts said.\nAnd experts see a low likelihood of the strike stretching beyond a week or two. While the Biden administration has said it does not plan to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act — which would break the strike and force a resolution — observers say the US president will likely step in if the shutdown continues for long.\n“[W]e believe the economic impact of a disruption would be too big to ignore for much more than a week given the economy and inflation are key issues in the heavily contested election,” wrote JPMorgan analysts.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Robust U.S. economic data is confronting investors with an unexpected question: whether strong growth can keep driving stocks higher even if the Federal Reserve delivers less monetary-policy easing than the market had hoped.\nExpectations that the Fed would pivot to cutting rates sent stocks soaring at the end of 2023 and pushed the S&P 500 to a record high in January. The index is up 4% this year after surging 24% in 2023.\nThat narrative has been jolted by evidence that the economy may be running too hot for the Fed to cut rates without risking an inflationary rebound. Friday's blockbuster U.S. employment number was the latest sign of stronger-than-expected growth, after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell days earlier deflated hopes the central bank would begin lowering rates in March.\n\"Looking back on the fourth quarter and the recent rally in stocks, a lot of it was driven from the thought of a Fed pivot, and the Fed pivot is evaporating in front of our eyes,\" said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.\nMarket expectations of a near-term rate cut dimmed after the jobs data, with futures tied to the Fed's main policy rate reflecting a 70% chance of the central bank lowering borrowing costs at its May 1 meeting, from over 90% on Thursday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a March cut stood at about 20%, from just under 50% a week ago.\nWith Friday's jobs report, \"the six or seven rate cuts that markets had been pricing in seems very offside,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a written commentary.\nFriday's jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 353,000 jobs last month - well above the 180,000 increase expected by economists polled by Reuters. The economy also added 126,000 more jobs in November and December than previously reported.\nPlenty of investors believe the strong growth is a positive for stocks, especially if accompanied by better-than-expected corporate earnings. The S&P 500 hit a fresh high on Friday after the jobs data, helped by the soaring shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Amazon, which rose 20% and 8%, respectively, following their corporate results.\nFor 2024, S&P 500 earnings are expected to jump nearly 10% after a 3.6% rise in 2023, according to LSEG data. Those expectations will be tested in the coming week with another heavy batch of reports, including from Eli Lilly, Walt Disney and ConocoPhillips.\n\"I'll trade a stronger economy with less rate cuts than a weaker economy with more rate cuts,\" said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.\nAnalysts at Capital Economics forecast a \"banner\" year for U.S. stocks, finishing 2024 over 10% above current levels at 5,500. Optimism over the business potential of artificial intelligence, which helped power stocks such as Nvidia last year, will likely drive those gains, they said.\nHowever, sustained above trend growth poses another issue - fears of an inflationary rebound.\n\"January job growth figures were strong, possibly too strong,\" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise, in a Friday note. \"There were multiple signs of strong wage growth which could filter through to resurgent ... inflation pressures if maintained.\"\nA longer period of high interest rates also could increase stress for areas of the economy that are already hurting such as commercial real estate.\nShares of New York Community Bancorp, a major CRE lender in New York, have tumbled in recent days, setting off broader regional banking concerns, after the company slashed its dividend and posted a surprise loss.\nRamped-up growth, along with expectations of rates staying at current levels for longer, could drive Treasury yields up. Higher yields can pressure equities because they compete with stocks for investors, while higher rates raise the cost of capital in the economy.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to bond prices, hit 4.05% on Friday.\nInvestors are still pricing in around 125 basis points of Fed cuts this year, LSEG data shows. That is down from around 150 basis points priced in earlier this week, but still far more than the 75 basis points the Fed has projected.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; additional reporting by Chibuike Oguh; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Richard Chang)"

        "date": "2024-11-26T14:35:40.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump wants to slap tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada on his first day in office, which would have devastating effects on supply chains and drive up costs on many companies that do business in the United States.\nThe president-elect made the announcement Monday on Truth Social, saying that he would institute a 25 percent tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico until drugs and migrants stopped arriving at the border.\n“This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!” Trump posted. “Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!”\nIn a separate post, Trump complained about China sending illegal drugs to the United States and threatened that country with a 10 percent tariff.\n“​​I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States—But to no avail,” Trump posted. “Representatives of China told me that they would institute their maximum penalty, that of death, for any drug dealers caught doing this but, unfortunately, they never followed through, and drugs are pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico, at levels never seen before.”\nThe three countries are America’s biggest trading partners, and many industries rely on exporting goods to them in addition to imports. These include car companies, farmers, and food packagers. In all, Canada, Mexico, and China make up more than a third of all U.S. imports and exports, with millions of jobs depending on them. Last year, the three countries bought over $1 trillion of U.S. exports and the U.S. imported nearly $1.5 trillion of goods and services from them.\nThese tariffs, added to the costs of goods in the U.S., would cause prices to skyrocket as companies would pass their costs to the consumer. Other countries would likely retaliate with tariffs on American products, hurting industries stateside. By all accounts, his plan would cripple the economy, and it has been criticized by most economists. Companies would be far more likely to take their business elsewhere rather than pay tariffs or shell out the high cost of relocating their operations to U.S. soil.\nPlus, the U.S. is currently part of a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico that Trump bragged about renegotiating during his first term. Tariffs would be a blatant violation of that agreement and also set off a trade war in North America. For a president who is riding a wave of economic dissatisfaction, however unjustified, into office, this will not bode well."

        "date": "2024-05-28T12:48:53.000Z",
        "article_content": "The U.S. economy is the most powerful and formidable in the world—and lots can be done to improve it. While economists focus on inflation and interest rates and politicians consider options through the lens of an election year, there’s a worrying trend that needs reversing if we are to maintain U.S. dominance and continue enjoying the benefits of our economy: There are fewer public companies in the U.S. than ever before.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon raised this issue in his annual letter a couple of weeks ago. In the mid-1990s, there were nearly 8,000 public companies listed in the U.S. Today, there are half as many, and at the current rate, we’ll see that number halved again by 2044. “The total should have grown dramatically, not shrunk,” Dimon wrote.\nThis reduction has been staggering in speed and scale, and it must be addressed, so entrepreneurship and innovation can flourish. Exit opportunities are critical to the promise of American innovation, and neglecting them will be to our collective detriment. It’s not only changing private markets but it’s also bad for our economy at large. It’s high time we reopen our public markets and incentivize the sort of innovation on which our economy depends.\nSeveral factors have precipitated this decline: mergers and acquisitions among public companies, increased regulatory hurdles and compliance costs, and the availability of more capital to allow companies to stay private for longer and avoid the pressure to deliver short-term results that comes with being public. The market is just not producing new listings quickly enough to keep pace—and it needs to make a stronger case for why companies should choose to go public instead of continuing along alternative paths.\nThe 2022 IPO market represented a 32-year low, and 2023 wasn’t any better (despite recent high-profile IPOs such as Ibotta, Reddit, and Astera Labs). But exit opportunities must exist. Young companies must build with the knowledge that public markets are open and promise lucrative returns. If that hope dims, the best and the brightest will turn their attention away from innovation. It’s worth noting that the EU is experiencing similar declines, while Asian exchanges are growing.\nWe need tools to help companies go public in the $1-to-5 billion range, which used to be common and is now all but impossible. Without proper measures, America’s reputation as the best region to do business and change the world through technology will be at risk.\nSeveral proposals have emerged to offer solutions to this decline. The SEC is currently contemplating a change that would force companies with a certain number of investors to publicly list their securities, even if the companies wouldn’t benefit from doing so. SPACs were also heralded as a potential solution (an IPO-lite process designed for small companies), and the market initially met them with excitement, but in recent years, they’ve been overburdened with regulations that all but obviate their intended purpose.\nThere’s a fundamentally American value present in our public markets: they’re available to everyone. With public markets, we can all have a stake in our shared economy—and we all benefit when more people and entities can access the wealth-creation opportunities public markets provide. By neglecting our public markets, we are denying an essential democratic component of our economic structure. (We recognize that many Americans lack the auxiliary income required to begin investing, and we’d like that to change as well.)\nSo let’s act swiftly. We can reprioritize business in this country, starting with loosening some of the regulatory hurdles (many of which were introduced in the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act) that make going public all but impossible.\nWe can build upon the 2012 JOBS Act to let companies test the waters more easily and at more modest valuations with room to grow. We can introduce scaled compliance requirements for smaller companies so they don’t have to do excessive reporting immediately, and instead work up to full disclosure, and we can reduce compliance costs writ large. We can offer tax incentives or other financial benefits to make going public a more appealing option for companies that could otherwise stay private. We can shorten lock-up periods for early investors post-IPO—these windows haven’t kept up with information acceleration and are too long to normalize pricing effectively. We can educate institutional and retail investors on the benefits of long-term thinking in the public markets, encouraging a culture of patient capital and generational value creation. Increasing financial literacy will help to improve investor confidence. These measures, enacted in collaboration across policymakers, regulators, investors, and the business community, will help enormously.\nBut most of all, private investors must do a better job of explaining to the market and the general public that business innovation is the greatest equalizer we have. Without taking the right measures to allow companies to grow and prosper in the public markets, America could lose that edge.\nEric Hippeau is Managing Partner at Lerer Hippeau.\nFannie Mae CEO: Beyoncé is right.

        "article_content": "The US economy created more new jobs than expected in February, while an increase in the unemployment rate for the first time in four months and downward revisions to job growth in prior months suggested signs of some softening in the US labor market.\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the labor market added 275,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in February, significantly more additions than the 200,000 expected by economists. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate increased to 3.9% from 3.7% in January. This marks the first increase in the unemployment rate in four months, as it now sits at its highest level in the last two years.\nA revised 229,000 jobs were added in January, according to the report, down from the 353,000 initially reported. In total, revisions showed there were 167,000 fewer jobs added in December and January than previously expected.\nMeanwhile, wages increased 0.1% on a monthly basis in February, slower than the 0.2% economists expected.\nThe downward revisions of previous months' job gains, coupled with the lower-than-anticipated wage growth, led one economist to conclude the Fed will be less concerned that a strong labor market will drive a resurgence in inflation.\n\"Alongside the rise in the unemployment rate to a two-year high and a much weaker rise in wages, there is less reason now to be concerned that renewed labour market strength will drive inflation higher again,\" Capital Economics chief US economist Andrew Hunter wrote in a note to clients.\nRead more: Inflation update on everyday expenses: Prescription drugs down, pet care way up\nElsewhere in the report, the labor force participation rate stayed flat at 62.5%, and the average weekly hours worked increased from 34.1 to 34.3.\nThe largest jobs increases in Friday's report were seen in healthcare which added 67,000 jobs in February.

        "article_content": "President-Elect Donald Trump’s upcoming second term raises critical questions about the impact of his economic policies on Gen Z — the youngest generation in the U.S. workforce.\n“Gen Z should watch for shifts in monetary policy, such as changes to interest rates, which could impact student loans, credit cards and mortgages,” said Jennifer Borrero, a global ambassador for the United Nations Association and the Founder of the Youth Housing Coalition.\n“A new administration might also bring changes to tax policies, energy subsidies or employment initiatives — all of which could directly affect disposable income and job opportunities,” Borrero said.\nRead Next: How To Financially Plan for the New Year Under the New Trump Presidency\nCheck Out: How To Get Expert Help for Your Finances – Even on a Budget\nAs the Trump economy begins, here are four money moves Gen Z should make before Inauguration Day.\nTrending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nBuilding an emergency fund is important, regardless of generation. However, Gen Z grew up witnessing the economic disruptions of the 2008 financial crisis and the global pandemic.\n“For short-term savings goals, everyone in Gen Z should aim to save an emergency fund,” said Benjamin Njila Fields, author of “Understanding Credit and Finances: How to Improve Your Credit Score.” “This provides the backbone of a proper financial plan that will make sure you never have to go into high-interest debt if an emergency comes up.”\nGen Zers might also need the extra cash if Trump’s tax cuts for corporations and high-income individuals result in cuts to social safety nets or public services.\n“This may disproportionately affect younger generations who rely on government programs like student loan forgiveness or healthcare assistance,” said Christopher Stroup, founder and president of Silicon Beach Financial.\n“If tax policy shifts to reduce deductions, credits, or increase tax rates on middle-income earners, Gen Z might face higher tax burdens, leaving less disposable income to put toward savings or investments.”\nTrending Now: How President-Elect Trump’s Win Could Impact Grocery Prices\nMany Gen Zers are entering a gig economy or working in roles with less job security, making it more difficult to have a steady income. These conditions could grow even more acute during a second Trump administration if he follows through on his campaign promises to deregulate businesses.\nLearning new technology skills or enhancing existing ones will be critical for Gen Zers to compete in the Trump economy, especially as freelancers. According to a Fiverr global study of Gen Zers, 70% of respondents said they are currently freelancing or plan to in the future.\n“With shifts in employment rates, Gen Zers should continue to upskill, especially in the use of AI,” said Emily Luk, CEO and co-founder of Plenty, a money management tool to help couples build wealth together. “This will be important to be an attractive candidate.”\nSocial Security’s fate is uncertain, especially for the Gen Z generation, people born between 1997 and 2012.\nThe federal program will face a shortfall in 2034 if Congress and the President don’t act. While President-elect Trump said he would protect Social Security, that doesn’t mean the program will be available when Gen Zers reach retirement age.\nAccording to an analysis by the nonpartisan watchdog Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump’s proposals to cut taxes and increase tariffs could mean less money for Social Security in the future.\n“Young investors should prioritize investing in tax-advantaged retirement accounts including Roth IRAs, health savings accounts (HSAs) and Roth 401Ks,” Fields said. “If you start in your late teens and early 20s, the amount of compound growth you will receive is astronomical.”\nFor example, Fields said that by contributing the maximum to a Roth IRA ($7,000 per year) and investing in the S&P 500 from ages 20 to 25, the compound growth alone leads to over $1,000,000 in retirement (age 65), even if you never invested another dollar.\nAlex Blackwood, CEO and co-founder of mogul Club, said his company allows Gen Zers to purchase shares in “high-quality, income-generating properties at little costs.”\n“It removes the traditional barriers of large down payments and full property ownership, making it an attractive move for young investors,” Blackwood said. “Starting small and diversifying through fractional investments can help young investors steadily build their portfolios, benefit from property appreciation and generate passive income.”\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "American consumers are finally feeling more confident. But they should brace for an \"initial severe overreaction in the economy\" if Donald Trump wins a second term.\nThat's according to an X post Tuesday that Elon Musk agreed with, predicting how Trump's mass deportations and Musk's proposed $2 trillion cut to federal spending would play out. The billionaire executive also said the effort would lead to \"temporary hardship\" in a virtual town hall last Friday.\nWhat's interesting is that Musk seems to acknowledge what economists have largely been warning the American public about when it comes to Trump's policies, specifically his tariffs, grab bag of tax breaks, and mass deportations.\nSome experts, though, are not too worried about the worst of the potential fallout, largely because they bet Trump won't be able to stomach the economic backlash to his own policies.\n\"Trump's going to do it until he doesn't do it,\" Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, said when talking about Trump's tariffs. \"If he gets elected, tariffs will last about a month, the economy will go terrible. Every adviser he has will tell him this is stupid and they'll stop it.\"\n\"So it really won't be a long-term thing,\" he added.\nThat's a big gamble when it's Americans' financial well-being at stake.\n\"Chaos.\" \"Destructive.\" \"A big hit to people's pocketbooks.\" \"Beyond irresponsible.\" \nThese are the words economists across the policy spectrum have used to describe the not-so-rosy outlook for the economy if Trump follows through on several of his policies, some of which he doesn't need Congress to approve.\nIn short order, mass deportations of undocumented workers would massively disrupt the workforces of major industries, including agriculture, construction, services, and manufacturing. An acute labor shortage would thrust prices higher for products these industries produce.\nMusk's promise to slash federal spending by $2 trillion as head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency comes with its own pain. Last year, the US spent $6.1 trillion, so Musk is looking to reduce that by a third. What would he cut first?\nLet's take a look.\nMedicare and Social Security? That would account for the whole $2 trillion and then some. Trump's tax, immigration, and tariff policies are already expected to hasten the depletion of the reserve funds for both programs.\nDefense? Nope, Trump plans to increase spending there.\nMaybe economic security programs such as Supplemental Security Income, food assistance, and unemployment insurance? Surely, those will be needed if a recession happens.\nWhat's not accounted for: the impact of Trump’s policies on the federal deficit — nearly $8 trillion by one estimate — and the cost of his proposed tariffs.\nLost revenue from those tariffs will come out of your pockets in the form of higher prices, with residents in the Midwest and South getting the brunt of it.\nCompanies will try to pass as much of the 60% tariffs on Chinese imports and the 10%-20% tariffs on all other imports on to their consumers. They're already planning on it, according to a report Wednesday in the Washington Post.\nTrump and his advisers know this. Why? Because he delayed implementing some tariffs during his first term until after the Christmas shopping season \"just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on US customers,\" Trump said at the time.\nThat's the hesitation that maybe some are betting on when, as the X poster predicted, the \"markets will tumble.\"\n\"I'm guessing that the stock market tanks. I am guessing that Trump gets strong market signals that this is a very bad idea and he changes his mind,\" and the fallout from his policies \"doesn't actually come to pass,\" Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a centrist think tank, told me earlier.\nThat could end up being wishful thinking.\nTrump, in fact, followed through on some of his tariffs in his first term, and this time around \"he's going to surround himself with a bunch of people who are just going to do what he thinks should be done,\" Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told me previously.\n\"There's going to be no restraints on him.\"\nFear not, there's a happy ending, according to the original X poster, who has 173,600 followers and joined the platform six years ago. After the initial economic pain, \"there will be a rapid recovery to a healthier, sustainable economy. History could be made in the coming two years.\" Just in time for the midterm elections.\n\"Sounds about right,\" Musk posted in response.\nTwo years seem like an awfully long time for the economy and the American people to suffer. The Great Recession lasted one and a half.\nDo voters realize this is the plan? They should. If Trump wins next week, their financial futures are on the line.\nJanna Herron is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @JannaHerron."

This could impact Gen Xers who are reliant on Social Security, healthcare and other public services.”\nAs the Trump economy begins, here are the four money moves Gen X should make before Inauguration Day.\nWith potential changes to Social Security and tax laws in the next decade, Gen X should evaluate their investment strategies to prepare for future uncertainties.\n“The need to work longer or delay claiming Social Security benefits could affect their retirement timeline and require more savings or a shift in investment strategy to compensate for the potential shortfall in expected benefits,” Stroup said.\nHe suggested the following adjustments to savings and investments to address possible shortfalls in benefits:\nAdapt Your Savings Approach: If Social Security benefits are reduced or delayed, consider saving more aggressively in IRAs or 401(k) plans to maintain your desired retirement lifestyle.\nDiversify Your Portfolio: Mitigate market volatility by spreading investments across asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities. Diversification helps buffer against downturns in specific markets.\nPrepare for Tax Reforms: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs, 401(k) plans and HSAs before any potential tax law changes take effect.\nThese adjustments can help you navigate economic uncertainties while staying on track with your long-term financial goals.\nLearn More: 5 Things Boomers Should Do With Their Money Now That Trump Will Be President\nStuart Schiffman, founder of Compound Wealth Advisors, said Gen X should be prepared for significant shifts in economic policy that could lead to reduced federal spending that could hit lower- and middle-income earners the hardest.\nHowever, Schiffman said Gen X is entering their peak earning years and should take advantage of retirement savings opportunities. For example, he recommended:\nTaking Advantage of Catch-Up Contributions: If you’re 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 to retirement accounts like 401(k) plans, with even higher limits for those aged 60-63 starting in 2025.\nConsidering Roth Contributions: For those who qualify, Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, offering flexibility and potential tax savings.\nOptimizing Health Savings Accounts: HSAs offer a unique triple tax advantage — pre-tax contributions, tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses — making them a powerful tool for retirement planning.\nWhile most money management advice geared towards Gen X focuses on savings, retirement and investing, small lifestyle changes can make a huge difference.\n“Even tiny tweaks, like swapping one takeout order for a home-cooked meal each week or using a browser extension to earn rewards as you shop online may seem little, but they build up over time and can seriously help you earn extra cash,” said Trae Bodge, a retail, smart shopping and money-saving expert.\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump promised to promote homeownership through tax incentives and boost housing supply by reducing zoning regulations.\nLaura Russo, vice president and senior wealth and fiduciary planning analyst at Wilmington Trust, said Gen Xers looking to buy a home should evaluate its impact on cash flow and spending.\n“It’s important to remember that home-related expenses do not stop with the mortgage payment,” Russo said. “Home maintenance can be just as expensive, particularly if there is an unforeseen repair that is required. For those thinking of selling a home, consider the potential tax implications of selling property that may have greatly increased in value over the years.”\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "title": "Private equity is devouring the economy as boomer entrepreneurs exit—but a new approach to employee ownership can change that",
        "date": "2024-07-24T14:24:15.000Z",
        "article_content": "Private equity roll-ups are gaining traction. The industry is growing five times faster than the U.S. economy as a whole and effectively “devouring” it. And there are rising concerns about PE’s impact on affordability and market power.\nPrivate equity companies are in the business of making money, and industry roll-ups present an opportunity to do so efficiently for several reasons:\nMany private companies exist in fragmented industries, where consolidation provides clear advantages.\nMany private companies are owned by baby boomers who lack sufficient succession planning.\nBuying companies at a relatively low price/earnings ratio, aggregating them, then selling at a higher price/earnings ratio is lucrative.\nPrivate equity companies recognize this model enables them to extract significant financial rewards. But company owners are beginning to realize they can beat private equity with a compelling alternative approach.\nThis became apparent to me through conversations with several past clients from decades ago. Few had successfully transitioned their companies to new owners. Several had been acquired by private equity firms. While they were pleased to seal the deal, I sensed a level of regret.\nOne president told me that he had been acquired by a private equity company. He was subsequently asked to stay on as a consultant to help them acquire even more companies and share the same best practices we had applied at his company. The first part went according to plan. They were successful at acquiring more companies. However, he admitted there was little success in sharing best practices. As he put it, PE companies are good at transactions, but not very good at operations.\nThe truth is, while PE companies have the unique capital and experience to acquire companies, they have little expertise in specific industries or running a company. Yet they extract a fortune for their efforts at industry roll-ups. Why can’t company owners create roll-ups like this themselves, without any private equity involvement?\nAnother past client, a civil engineering company based in Wisconsin, did just that. They made over 20 acquisitions in their sector with the following characteristics:\nNo involvement of private equity firms.\nImplementation of an Employee Stock Ownership Program (ESOP), resulting in substantial tax benefits.\nIntegration of acquired companies into the ESOP structure, fostering common stock ownership among a growing number of employees.\nEmphasis on sharing best practices through \"communities of practice,\" enhancing employee engagement and performance.\nThe result? Their valuation surged more than sixfold in the last five years, with no sign of slowing. It’s a win-win in which customers benefit, and the wealth created remains in the hands of those who work hard to create it.\nPooling resources under one ESOP structure means the cost of the ESOP per company plummets. Individual companies can operate autonomously. Meanwhile, the employees become company owners, who can directly improve the value of their stock by sharing and implementing best practices. Their chances of succeeding at this are greater than the PE company’s because they understand their industry and people. And if they apply a management approach like economic engagement, which is shown to double profit growth, this further enhances their competitive edge. This industry roll-up alternative is becoming known as “rewarding roll-ups.”\nESOPs are frequently seen as an exit tool for owners, but rewarding roll-ups uses it as a foundation for considerable additional growth in equity, shared by both employees and owners. And there is at least one additional benefit: job security.\nIn an inevitable downturn, a PE company likely won’t care about laying off employees. But companies courting this novel model can invite more companies into the roll-up at lower costs due to the downturn. The expansion creates plenty of work for existing employees, improving job security and stock value, and ultimately boosting profits for everyone. It’s worth noting that the aforementioned civil engineering company hasn’t had a layoff in the last 20+ years.\nBroad awareness and adoption of this approach are limited but growing quickly. By reframing ESOPs as a platform for growth rather than just an exit strategy, company owners can make something even more meaningful of their life’s work.\nIt’s time we find a compelling alternative to private equity. It’s time to invest back into the people who create a company’s value: the employees and the stakeholders.\nWomen can’t fix the ‘broken rung’ unless they acknowledge the role they play in workplace bullying and discrimination\nTech billionaires’ Trump-Vance dance is missing the point: You can’t always get what you want\nGen Z’s enthusiasm for all things touchable is resurrecting the analog economy—and costing parents\nNokia CEO: Europe shouldn’t be afraid to back its innovation champions\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nBillionaire Jeremy Grantham is a British investor who has built a reputation over the years for anticipating bubbles and financial crises. He co-founded Boston-based GMO LLC, which has about $60 billion in assets under management.\nIn September 2007, Grantham wrote an article for Fortune, saying the US housing market was in \"genuine bubble territory\" and prices were \"guaranteed\" to fall. Grantham also foresaw the Japanese asset price bubble and the dot-com bubble.\nDon’t Miss Out:\nFind out how you compare to the average American couple’s retirement balance — will you make the $1,000,000 mark?\nGet ‘em while you can — investing in this asset class may be reaching a high-water mark but you can still make returns right now.\nGrantham also said the surge in stock prices following the pandemic was somewhat similar to the 2000 tech bubble. However, he believed the AI-led market rally delayed the recession he'd warned about for months.\nIn August, Grantham gave a detailed interview to the YouTube channel We Study Billionaires, in which he reiterated his warnings and made some serious predictions.\nGrantham analyzed the market bubbles, including the Japanese bubble in the 1980s. The billionaire called Japan the \"mother and father\" of all bubbles. He said a high P/E ratio does not indicate a healthy market and should often alarm investors about things to come.\n\"So you fast forward to Japan, which is, in a way, the mother and father of all bubbles. The Japanese market had never sold over 25 times earnings until it did in '87. By '89, it was put to us that it was 65 times earnings. As far as we could tell, the Japanese market was 65 times trading earnings, never having sold above 25. And this is what should put the fear of God in anyone trying to time the market. This had gone up 150 percent more than it ever had in history.\"\nGrantham Says This is the \"Most Vulnerable Market There Has Ever Been\"\nGrantham said high earnings multiples often project the \"worst periods of our history,\" and since today's market is trading at a high multiple, he's issuing recession warnings.\n\"Constantly for 30 years, this is the most vulnerable market there has ever been and given the incredible record of the past that the highest multiples do not predict good times—which you learn a business school but have historically predicted the worst times.\"\n\"You Will Not Be Warned\"\nGrantham said the market does not usually take caution or concerns seriously before things go off the peak, but he still warned listeners of the interview:\n\"And, of course, the market does not feel concerned or cautious. It didn't in 1929. It didn't in Japan in ‘89. It didn't in the U.S. before the housing bust of 2007-2008. That's the way the market is. So, dear listener, get used to it. You will not be warned.\"\nGrantham, 85, said the market was starting to decline when ChatGPT was released in November 2022, causing the Magnificent Seven stocks to reach new highs. While the investor is skeptical about the ROI of AI spending, he's sure AI will change the world.\n\"AI played a very big role. AI is serious. Whether people will actually make real money is another matter, but is it serious? Yes, it is. It will change the nature of warfare completely. It will know who you are. It will have face identification. It will be an alarming tool for governments to know what you're doing, who you are, where you are and, if necessary, in warfare, destroy you.\"\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n‘It's Not Clear' Whether Spending on AI Chips Will Get a Return\nHowever, Grantham is not sure whether AI spending will meet market expectations when it comes to returns:\n\"And everyone's putting a lot of money into developing AI products. And so the chip seller is brilliant and it's not clear yet whether the people paying for the chips will ever get a return on them and we'll find out. I don't think it's inconceivable,\" Grantham added.\nIn the interview, Grantham predicted a recession, citing unemployment data and historical patterns.\nHe said unemployment is one of the \"best indicators\" of recession.\n\"If you see that in a long-term chart, you'd be impressed. When the market ticks up 50 basis points, half a percent in unemployment, 70 percent of the time it's followed by a recession. When it ticks up 0.6 percent, it is followed 100 percent of the time historically with the recession. Today, it's 0.7. Today, it is nicely, I mean visibly, above the level that historically has always predicted a recession. Recessions have this slippery habit of taking a little longer than you would like.\"\nHow Did Grantham Predict the Japanese Asset Bubble Burst?Later in the interview, the fund manager explained how he was able to spot the cracks in the Japanese market in the past.\n\"I have spent my entire life being early in the stock market. The most important one probably was Japan. We were one of the early firms in international investing and we knew that Japan had never sold over 25. And by the time it got to 45, we felt it was almost immoral to be in Japan.\"\nWhen Grantham gave this interview, the Fed had not started cutting rates. With a 50-basis-point rate cut now announced and inflation on the decline, it'll be interesting to see how Grantham's predictions pan out in the coming weeks and months.\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "title": "Gen Zers are so disillusioned with the economy that they think it’s OK to commit fraud",
        "date": "2024-07-03T10:24:41.000Z",
        "article_content": "Each quarter, my company Sift produces an index report to better understand the latest online fraud trends, including how businesses and consumers are affected, emerging fraud tactics, and how fraud impacts consumer behavior when making purchases online. For the past two quarters, we’ve seen a surprising generational divide emerge: Gen Z— born between 1997 and 2012—expresses more willingness than any other generation to commit digital fraud.\nIn Q4 2023, 42% of Gen Zers admitted a willingness to engage in first-party fraud, where they dispute a purchase with their payment provider despite the purchase being legitimate. This was significantly higher than any other generation—the next highest was millennials, with only 22% admitting to engaging in first-party fraud. This quarter, we discovered that 33% of Gen Z respondents either know someone who has participated in payment fraud or have done so themselves. Again, these rates are much higher than other generations.\nThis data might seem sensational, but if we explore it more deeply, it’s very telling. Academics have a theory called the “fraud triangle,” which argues that people are more inclined to commit fraud if they have incentive, rationalization, and opportunity.\nGen Z has a number of unfortunate economic factors to feel anxious about. A survey from Intuit found that 73% of Zoomers feel that the current economic environment has made it more challenging to save money. They’re struggling with increased housing costs, student loan debt, and rising prices on everyday purchases like groceries, all while wages have stagnated for workers across many income levels.\nThese factors snowball into a financially stressful situation that makes it more challenging to afford day-to-day necessities. Unsurprisingly, more economic anxiety can inspire people to look for tactics to stretch every dollar. For most, this behavior is innocuous: clipping coupons, switching from name-brand to generic items, or shopping secondhand. In fact, Gen Z is also the most likely to shop for secondhand items online, with 42% of this generation purchasing a resale item in the past year.\nBut facing the wrong set of circumstances, some people will turn to stolen payment methods or chargebacks to get more with less. In these situations, consumers may rationalize fraudulent behavior by convincing themselves that their actions are necessary or justified given the economic environment. They may view their actions as a temporary solution, or even as a moral gray area with few consequences to anyone.\nGen Z may see large corporations as a cause for these broader economic challenges, making them less likely to view stealing from them as immoral. They may see this behavior as a victimless crime, as the companies they are transacting with are often industry behemoths.\nThey also have less loyalty to legacy brands compared to earlier generations. Name recognition alone is not enough to compel Gen Zers to make a purchase. Increasingly, they are looking for “dupes” as a way to save money, prioritizing cheaper goods and services over premium brands. This spans all types of purchases, from clothing and accessories to beauty and personal care products. They’re also more willing to try new brands and are less swayed by established names and celebrity endorsements.\nThis mentality extends beyond the businesses they buy from. Gen Zers also prioritize spending flexibility and are more drawn to monthly subscriptions or sharing services that allow access without the commitment of ownership, from car-sharing to video streaming to product subscriptions.\nWith that desire for unlimited access to goods and services, comes a natural drive to maintain that access, which could make shoppers more inclined to turn to nefarious means to do so. The logic is that a company will most likely notice if you’re stealing a car or TV—but the risk is far less likely with a $6.99 monthly subscription.\nGen Z is more heavily influenced by social media and spends more time online than any other generation, allowing online trends to dictate what they buy and how they get their news.\nTheir time on social media also exposes them to more fraud. Harkening back to iconic online grifters like Anna Delvey and Fyre Fest, there’s a newer category of influencers that’s promoting more outright fraud, selling step-by-step guides that detail how to hack into accounts or make purchases with stolen payment methods. Sift data finds that 34% of Gen Zers have seen offers to take part in online fraud, compared to only 9% of baby boomers. That exposure to social media content is another key reason why Gen Z is more likely to commit fraud—and highlights the deep influence of social media on consumer behaviors.\nThis generation's unique challenges and perspectives create the need for a nuanced approach from businesses, one that addresses their economic anxieties, adapts to their consumer habits, and engages with them where they are online.\nSome proven approaches include:\nEmphasizing authenticity and social responsibility. This helps consumers feel a deeper emotional connection to a brand and prevents them from treating it like a faceless entity.\nProviding discounts and flexible payment options like BNPL (buy now, pay later), so consumers can simultaneously save and splurge.\nPromoting flexibility, through offerings like monthly, low-cost subscriptions.\nOffering clear return policies to minimize returns fraud and give shoppers more peace of mind.\nPrioritizing responsive customer service and offering refunds or alternatives promptly so shoppers don’t turn to chargebacks to address any issues.\nThe willingness of Gen Z to engage in online fraud is a reflection of the complex interplay of economic pressures, changing consumer behaviors, and the influence of social media. This trend, while having a real business impact, stems from a place of financial stress, a desire for affordability, and a distinct approach to brand loyalty and consumption.\nIt’s essential to view these findings and recommendations not as an indictment of a generation but as a window into a group that is increasing its purchasing power, even as it faces more economic hurdles.\nBooz Allen Hamilton CEO: America needs a whole-of-nation approach in its great power competition with China\n‘A head-in-the-sand approach’: The U.S. strategic drug stockpile is inadequate for a bird flu outbreak\nThe national debt is over $34 trillion.

        "title": "Solid US retail sales in October underscore economy's resilience",
        "date": "2024-11-15T18:03:35.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. retail sales increased slightly more than expected in October as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and electronic goods, suggesting the economy kicked off the fourth quarter on a strong note.\nThe fairly upbeat sales report on Friday, which was accompanied by sharp upward revisions to September's data, together with news of a rebound in import prices last month, prompted traders to pare back expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday \"the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates.\"\n\"Retail sales data today make many in the markets wonder if another rate cut at the December meeting is warranted at all,\" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. \"With fiscal policy expected to shift into high gear on the pro-growth stimulus side, perhaps the Fed's monetary policy should not be putting another log on the fire to fuel growth by lowering rates, as it could lead to a return of inflation.\"\nRetail sales rose 0.4% last month after an upwardly revised 0.8% advance in September, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, would climb 0.3% after a previously reported 0.4% gain in September.\nSales at auto dealerships accelerated by 1.6%, while receipts at service stations gained 0.1%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rebounded 2.3%. Receipts at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, increased 0.7% after rising 1.2% in September. Economists view dining out as a key indicator of household finances.\nBuilding material and garden equipment store sales rose 0.5%, likely boosted by rebuilding efforts in areas devastated by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Online retail sales edged up 0.3%, despite Amazon's Prime Day promotion.\nBut sales at clothing stores fell 0.2% while those at furniture outlets declined 1.3%.\nThere were also decreases in sales at miscellaneous retailers, health and personal care as well as sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores.\nRobust consumer spending helped the economy maintain its strong pace of growth last quarter. Consumption is being largely underpinned by low layoffs, with additional help from strong household balance sheets thanks to a stock market rally and high home prices. Though inflation has not made much headway in recent months, it is on a downward trend, raising households' purchasing power. Household savings also remain lofty.\nConcerns have been raised that growth is mostly being driven by middle- and upper-income households, which have more flexibility and substitutability of consumption. But Bank of America card data shows spending resilient across income groups.\n\"We do not see signs of increased reliance on credit cards in any income cohort,\" said Aditya Bhave, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Securities. \"However, we note that higher-income households appear to be outperforming in certain service sectors such as airlines, lodging, entertainment and cruises.\"\nEconomists expect retailers will enjoy a fairly decent holiday shopping season, which starts later this month.\nSTRONG UPWARD REVISION\nRetail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services dipped 0.1% last month after an upwardly revised 1.2% gain in September. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have jumped 0.7% in September.\nBut data for August was revised lower, suggesting that third-quarter consumer spending growth pace could be trimmed down to a 3.5% annualized rate from the 3.7% pace estimated last month. Nonetheless, the sharp upward revision to September's core retail sales put consumer spending and the overall economy on a higher growth trajectory.\nEconomists estimated that consumer spending was growing at a 3.0% rate early in the October-December quarter.\nHurricanes and a strike by factory workers at Boeing, which depressed industrial production in September and October, were expected to temporarily slow economic growth to around a 2.5% pace in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.8% rate in the third quarter.\nShortly after the data, financial markets lowered the odds of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed's Dec. 17-18 meeting to 58.4% from 61.6% earlier, CME Group's FedWatch Tool showed. The odds of rates being unchanged increased to 41.6% from 38.4.\nSome economists see a rate cut next month as a very close call, citing the lack of progress in lowering inflation back to the U.S. central bank's 2% target.\nStocks on Wall Street traded lower. U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note briefly hitting a 5-1/2-month high. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies.\nThe Fed last week cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to the 4.50%-4.75% range. The central bank embarked on its policy easing cycle with an unusually large half-percentage-point rate cut in September, its first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020. It hiked rates by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation.\nA separate report from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics showed import prices rebounded 0.3% in October after an unrevised 0.4% decline in September. Economists had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, would slip 0.1%.\nIn the 12 months through October, import prices increased 0.8% after dipping 0.1% in the 12 months through September.\nImported fuel prices rose 1.5% after two straight monthly declines. Food prices fell 1.6%, declining for the third consecutive month. Excluding fuels and food, import prices gained 0.4% after rising 0.3% in September.\nThe so-called core import prices increased 2.2% on a year-on-year basis in October despite the dollar's appreciation against the currencies of the main U.S. trade partners. A rising dollar normally dampens import price pressures.\nGovernment data this week showed consumer prices increased 0.2% for a fourth straight month in October while producer prices picked up 0.2%.\nThe import price data cemented economists' estimates of a 0.3% increase in October in the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy categories. That would match September's gain and lift the annual increase in core inflation to 2.8% from 2.7% in September. The core PCE price index is one of the measures tracked by the Fed for monetary policy.\n\"While we expect a continued broad-based cooling in consumer price inflation overall next year, the outlook for goods prices in particular may be clouded by potentially offsetting effects from the incoming administration's trade policies and further dollar appreciation,\" said Michael Hanson, an economist at JPMorgan.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Paul Simao)"

        "article_content": "The US economy grew more slowly than initially thought during the first quarter.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis's second estimate of first quarter US gross domestic product (GDP) showed the economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.3% during the period, down from a first reading in April of 1.6% growth and in line with economist estimates. \nThe update to the first quarter growth metric \"primarily reflected a downward revision to consumer spending,\" per the BEA. Personal consumption in the first quarter grew at 2%, down from a prior reading of 2.5%.\nThe reading came in significantly lower than fourth quarter GDP, which was revised up to 3.4%.\n“The weaker headline growth statistic looks discouraging, but it belies solid underlying momentum as the economy’s core — private domestic sales to domestic purchasers — showed a healthy expansion of 2.5% annualized,” Nationwide financial markets economist Oren Klachkin wrote of this morning’s release of Q1 GDP revision data.\nThe slowdown in headline GDP comes at a time when markets have been sensitive to any readings indicating that the economy may be running too hot for the Federal Reserve's liking, as inflation has proved stickier than expected. The concern is red-hot growth would boost price increases.\nRead more: How does the labor market affect inflation?\nMany forecasters don't see the first quarter economic growth slowdown as the start of a broader trend. Prior to Thursday's reading, Goldman Sachs expected 3.2% annualized growth in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecaster is currently projecting 3.5% annualized growth in the second quarter.\n“Monthly data beyond March generally point to a continued, albeit gently cooling, economic expansion,\" Klachkin wrote. \"We anticipate continued GDP gains this year and a healthy advance in 2024 overall.”\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-04-19T11:00:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Tesla has had a remarkable impact on popularizing electric vehicles, with the Model Y being the best-selling car of 2023 worldwide, regardless of powertrain. It is a remarkable achievement for an EV to top all dirty fuel-powered vehicles in annual sales.\nTesla's impact, however, extends beyond taking polluting cars off the road and making EVs more viable. In Texas, the company's gigafactory is providing huge benefits for the state's employment statistics.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Tesla is the biggest private employer in Austin, with 22,777 employees across the company's operations. That's an 86% increase in headcount compared to last year, as a company compliance report detailed.\nThat rise in staff might partly be down to the Cybertruck, which was finally launched toward the end of 2023. The all-electric pickup is made at the Texas facility, which also produces the record-breaking Model Y and 4680 battery cells.\nIn addition to the gigafactory, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also bringing other business ventures to the state. A SpaceX satellite factory is set to be built in Bastrop, while Corpus Christi will soon be home to a lithium refinery, per Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Boca Chica already has a SpaceX launch site, and there's an engine-testing facility in Waco. That's not to mention additional Musk facilities to serve his employees.\n\"It is rare that a single individual develops such diverse enterprises with substantial impact across various regions,\" said Ray Perryman, who runs an economic research firm in Waco, per Bloomberg. \"The direct impact of companies which Elon Musk has brought to Texas is as large as some significant manufacturing sectors, such as beverage or electrical equipment production.\"\nBut the gigafactory is the most notable operation in terms of reducing planet-warming pollution. Model Ys and Cybertrucks are helping to boost the presence of EVs on the nation's roads, while Tesla's ambition to ensure they can be charged at easily accessible locations is also increasing the charging points that other EV users can take advantage of.\nAccording to S&P Global Mobility, EV sales grew by 52% in 2023 in the United States. While that isn't all because of Tesla — the Inflation Reduction Act offering incentives for EV purchases certainly helped — over the years, the company has proved that swapping dirty fuel for electricity to power a vehicle doesn't mean compromising comfort or performance.\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and actionable info that makes it easy to help yourself while helping the planet."

        "date": "2024-04-26T09:20:09.000Z",
        "article_content": "New data revealed a slowdown in the US economy in the first three months of the year. But even more concerning to investors was that inflation accelerated faster than Wall Street had expected, sending shockwaves through markets on Thursday.\nThe latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed the \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, grew by 3.7% year over year in the first quarter, above estimates for 3.4% and significantly higher than 2% gain seen in the prior quarter.\nThis marked the first quarterly increase in the Fed's preferred inflation gauge in a year, underscoring concerns that the central bank may not cut interest rates as quickly as it has projected.\nLosses in markets, sparked by disappointing earnings from Meta on Wednesday, accelerated on Thursday following the BEA report. All three major indexes were down more than 1% midday while bond yields spiked, though they recovered some of those steep losses by the close. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), a recent headwind for stocks, ticked higher to reach above 4.7% at one point for the first time since early November.\n\"The difficult part [of Thursday's data release] for the Fed and for the markets was core PCE was the inflation print,\" Deutsche Bank senior US economist Brett Ryan told Yahoo Finance. \"And that's really what is troublesome from the Fed's perspective and why the market reacted quite negatively because it really puts the Fed in an awkward position, and you start to question whether they can cut at all this year.\"\nHe added that the data could have implications for a separate inflation print scheduled for release on Friday. Ryan notes that Thursday's reading on price increases for the quarter indicates that either March's PCE reading will be hotter than expected or revisions will show inflation was actually higher than previously thought in January and February. Neither bodes well for rate cut prospects.\nExpectations for Fed rate cuts, which had already scaled back significantly this year from a peak of nearly seven cuts in early January, fell further on Thursday. Markets are now pricing in just one rate cut this year, per Bloomberg data.\nThe key to this move has been a rewriting of what consensus expected for inflation this year.\n\"Forecasters thought 'mission accomplished.' Instead, we now have a red flashing warning sign,\" economist Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, told Yahoo Finance.\nHe added: \"The Fed will not be able to be reassured enough about inflation to cut rates anytime this year, maybe in December, probably not. The only thing that's going to get us Fed rate cuts anytime soon is a much more rapid deterioration in the job market than I expect to get.\"\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently reiterated that the Fed won't be cutting rates until it has \"greater confidence\" in inflation's decline.\n\"The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,\" Powell said on April 16.\nElsewhere in Thursday's data release, economic growth for the quarter fell short of expectations. The advance estimate of first quarter US gross domestic product (GDP) showed the economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.6% during the period. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimated the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.5% during the period.\nEconomists noted a large part of the slowdown in economic growth came in volatile categories that could rebound in the next quarter, leaving the increase in inflation as the most crucial part of Thursday's economic data dump.\n\"There was very little to be worried about in terms of real GDP and real growth in this print,\" Furman said. \"There was a lot to be worried about in terms of inflation.\"\nMany strategists have argued the market could still chug higher even if the Fed doesn't cut interest rates this year. But in the near term, the scaling back of interest rate cut expectations has sent bond yields higher. In the current market dynamic, rising bond yields haven't been a welcome sign for stocks.\n\"We're living in a very bond-driven equity market today,\" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz.\nAnd for now, the incoming inflation data is doing little to help on that front.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

As well, the U.S. stock market rally will broaden, with earnings being the primary driver of prices across equity asset classes.\nWFII expects equity market leadership breadth to continue to widen, including extended participation by more cyclically oriented areas of the market, such as small-cap equities and the Financials, Communication Services, Industrials, and Energy sectors of the S&P 500 Index.\n\"We continue to believe that equity markets look attractive for 2025, with broader sector leadership and participation, thanks to improving fundamentals and a policy tailwind,\" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Wealth & Investment Management. \"The incoming administration and congressional leaders want a fast start, with likely policy priorities including extending tax benefits, deregulation, tariffs, and tighter border control. We expect that these policies will support our guidance.\"\nOutlook on global economy and asset groups:\nGlobal economy: We believe the U.S. economy will lead the global economy, as economic recoveries in Europe, China, and emerging markets face significant headwinds.\nGlobal equities: We expect returns to be driven mainly by earnings growth, but valuations should remain supportive.\nGlobal fixed income: Short-term U.S. Treasury rates likely will fall with the Federal Reserve policy rate, but longer-term rates should rise with economic growth, tariffs, and immigration restrictions.\nGlobal real assets: We believe commodities are well-positioned to benefit from slow supply growth and a global demand rebound that is driven by a modest international economic recovery and lower global interest rates.\nGlobal alternative investments: Global alternative investments are likely to benefit from a pickup in merger and acquisition activity, lower cost of borrowing, and increasing confidence that economic growth is sustainable.\nTop portfolio ideas:\nPrepare for abundant liquidity to diversify investment opportunities\nPosition for a cyclical recovery but remain tilted toward U.S. assets\nRethink investment income\nConsider expanding opportunities in artificial intelligence\nKeep extreme risks in perspective\nHighlights of WFII’s forecast:\nThe anticipated U.S. GDP (gross domestic product) growth target for 2025 year-end is 2.5%.\nThe target for U.S. consumer price inflation in 2025 is 3.3%.\nThe S&P 500 Index price target range is 6,500 – 6,700 for year-end 2025.\nThe Federal funds rate forecast for 2025 is 4.00% – 4.25%, with 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury yield forecasts of 4.50%-5.00% and 4.75%-5.25%, respectively.\nThe full report provides guidance for investors to help navigate the next 12 months, long-term themes that WFII believes are investable now, a closer look on sector and sub-sector preferences, as well as U.S. and international political risks that could impact investment returns.

        "article_content": "The steady Sleep Economy or Sleep Aids market revenue growth can be attributed to increasing prevalence of sleep disorders, growing investments and funding by government toward promoting sleep health and recent trends and innovations in sleep technology\nVancouver, Jan. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global sleep economy or sleep aids market size was USD 512.80 Billion in 2022 and is expected to register a revenue CAGR of 6.3% during the forecast period. The steady market revenue growth can be attributed to increasing prevalence of sleep disorders, growing investments and funding by government toward promoting sleep health, and recent trends and innovations in sleep technology. In addition to this, growing market trend for wearable sleep aid devices is a major factor driving revenue growth of the market globally.\nThree components make up the sleep economy including ambiance adjustment such as bedding, lighting, and temperature management, routine management such as sleep monitoring or meditation applications, and therapeutic treatment such as over-the-counter or prescription medications and sleep apnea devices. Future development of sleep-focused lines of products will continue to take advantage of movement toward sleep as a lifestyle by existing or new beauty, fitness, and wellness businesses. While bed-in-a-box businesses began with mattresses before diversifying into pillows, night lamps, and sleep aids, mindfulness startups such as Calm are currently attempting to dominate the market on bedtime stories.\nThe market revenue growth is being driven by an increase in the manufacturing of soft solutions, such as wearable sleep-monitoring devices and designer mattresses and pillows. Sleep industry innovations are classified as hard or soft solutions. Hard solutions are defined as anything that can be consumed by end-user to treat a sleeping disorder, including pills, powders, beverages, concentrates, emulsions, and other ingestible substances. Soft solutions are anything that end-user does not consume, such as apps, wearable technology, smart mattresses, pillows, and other wearables, as well as external monitoring and gadgets.\nRequest Free Sample Copy (To Understand the Complete Structure of this Report [Summary + TOC]) @ https://www.emergenresearch.com/request-sample/2074\nOne of the major factors driving revenue growth of the market is increasing prevalence of sleep disorders among population. According to the American Sleep Apnea Association, 84 million adults (or nearly 1 in 3 adults) do not consistently obtain the recommended amount of undisturbed sleep they need to maintain their health. Between 50 and 70 million Americans are estimated to suffer sleep problems. The prevalence of narcolepsy grew by 14%, while obstructive sleep apnea climbed by 41%, according to the study. In addition, hypersomnia (32%), periodic limb movement disorder (30%), and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (64%), all had an increase in prevalence.\nOne of the major challenges restraining revenue growth of the market is side effects of drugstore sleep economy or sleep aids. Dry mouth, urine retention, impaired vision, disorientation, and constipation are some of the side effects of sleep medicines. Since older or elderly people can be more susceptible to disorientation, vertigo, and falls, their use of these drugs raises particular safety concerns. In addition, due to widespread availability, customers are increasingly purchasing sleeping medications without a prescription. The efficacy and safety of over-the-counter sleeping pills are still largely unclear. These factors are restraining revenue growth of the market.\nSegment Insights\nProduct Type Insights:\nOn the basis of product type, the global sleep economy or sleep aids market is segmented into sleep products, sleep medications and supplements, sleep technology, and sleep services.\nThe sleep technology segment accounted for largest revenue share in 2022. The field of sleep technology is currently expanding, bringing in new players from start-ups to major technology companies, and capturing interest of insurance providers, and healthcare providers. Remote monitoring is a useful tool for doctors looking to better understand sleep and identify efficient ways to treat its abnormalities as wearables become more widely used. The California-based healthcare business ResMed, which provides gadgets and digital health technology to treat sleep apnea, was a pioneer in the use of remote sleep monitoring techniques.\nSleep Disorder Insights:\nOn the basis of sleep disorder, the global sleep economy or sleep aids market is segmented into insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, parasomnia, and others.\nThe sleep apnea segment accounted for largest revenue share in 2022. The American Medical Association estimates that 30 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea. The most prevalent variety is obstructive sleep apnea, and according to research, 26% of Americans between the ages of 30 and 70 have it. At least 80% of those who suffer from the condition are undiagnosed. Rising applications of oral appliances is another factor driving revenue growth of this segment. For instance, according to specialists, Mandibular Advancement Devices (MADs), which are similar to mouthguards, have been demonstrated to function, as well as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in treating sleep apnea in many patients.\nEmergen Research is Offering Limited Time Discount (Grab a Copy at Discounted Price Now) @ https://www.emergenresearch.com/request-discount/2074\nRegional Insights:\nNorth America accounted for second-largest revenue share in 2022. The sleep economy or sleep aids market is growing in this region, owing to increasing government initiatives and funding toward research and development in the field of sleep economy or sleep aids, as well as growing consumer interest and rapid adoption of sleep technology such as wearable sleep trackers and monitoring apps, especially in the U.S., which is resulting in revenue growth of the market. For instance, on 29 June 2022, the Government of Canada announced a USD 3.8 million funding package to encourage study on insomnia and sleep health.\nEurope market accounted for a significantly large revenue share in 2022. This is attributed to growing government regulations, rising regulatory approvals for sleep aid medications, and major key strategic initiatives as well as rising Research and Development (R&D) activities which are driving revenue growth of the market in this region. For instance, on 15 November 2022, Idorsia Ltd announced that QUVIVIQTM (daridorexant) is now accessible in the first European countries, Italy and Germany, for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia that have symptoms present for at least three months and a major impact on daytime functioning.\nScope of Research \nReport Details\nOutcome\nMarket size in 2022\nUSD 512.80 Billion\nCAGR (2023–2032)\n6.3%\nRevenue forecast to 2032\nUSD 950.22 Billion\nBase year for estimation\n2022\nHistorical data\n2019-2021\nForecast period\n2023–2032\nQuantitative units\nRevenue in USD Billion and CAGR in % from 2023 to 2032\nReport coverage\nRevenue forecast, company ranking, competitive landscape, growth factors, and trends\nSegments covered\nProduct Type, Sleep Disorder, Distribution Channel, and region\nRegional scope\nNorth America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Middle East & Africa\nCountry scope\nU.S., Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, U.K., Italy, Spain, Benelux, Rest of Europe, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Rest of APAC, Brazil, Rest of LATAM, Saudi Arabia, UAE, South Africa, Turkey, Rest of MEA\nKey companies profiled\nGlaxoSmithKline Plc., Merck KGaA, Amazon.com, Inc., Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Koninklijke Philips N.V., SlimScience, BAYER AG, THE SLEEP COMPANY, Eisai Co., Ltd, and ResMed\nCustomization scope\n10 hours of free customization and expert consultation\nDirect Order Can Be Placed Through This Link [Exclusive Copy] @ https://www.emergenresearch.com/select-license/2074\nMajor Companies and Competitive Landscape \nThe global sleep economy or sleep aids market is fairly fragmented, with many large and medium-sized players accounting for the majority of market revenue.

        "date": "2024-12-09T11:00:38.000Z",
        "article_content": "The announcements came like a metronome at the start of last season, a steady stream of almost weekly news releases from the Dodgers announcing one Japanese sponsorship deal after the next.\nApril 1: Dodgers and All Nippon Airways (Japan’s biggest airline) announce multi-year partnership.\nApril 4: Dodgers and Toyo Tires (one of Japan’s biggest tire companies) agree to multi-year partnership.\nApril 8: Dodgers and Kowa (a Japanese trading and manufacturing company) announce multi-year partnership.\nApril 22: Dodgers and Daiso (a Japanese retailer) enter into multi-year partnership.\nOn and on it went this year, with the Dodgers striking agreements with Japan-based companies producing everything from personal-care cosmetics (Kosé) to fermented dairy drinks (Yakult) to electric vehicles (Afeela).\nRead more: Complete coverage: Shohei Ohtani signs record deal with Dodgers\nIt was the kind of barrage the Dodgers were anticipating when they signed Shohei Ohtani a year ago today, recognizing the global attention — and lucrative marketing potential — the two-way star and three-time MVP had after signing a heavily deferred 10-year, $700-million contract.\nTwelve months later, however, top Dodgers executives have acknowledged that Ohtani’s influence exceeded even their lofty ambitions.\nIn the same way Ohtani’s bat transformed the Dodgers’ World Series-winning lineup on the field, his celebrity redefined the club’s business capabilities off of it.\n“We do our best to capitalize on whatever opportunities we have, and I think we were well prepared for it,” team president Stan Kasten said. “But what we weren’t prepared for was how significant his impact would be. It really transcended any of our plans. It just did.”\nNone of this comes as a major surprise.\nNear the end of Ohtani’s tenure with the Angels, the Japanese superstar was believed to generate roughly $10 million to $20 million annually in extra revenue for the club. Many of the companies advertising in Dodger Stadium now had signage plastered all over Angel Stadium before.\nUpon his signing with the Dodgers, such Ohtani-related revenues were only expected to grow. After all, they were the more popular Southland team. They had a globally recognizable brand. And even before accounting for the staggering $680 million of deferrals Ohtani proposed in his contract — a structure that preserved the Dodgers’ payroll flexibility by paying him only $2 million in salary each year — some industry experts predicted he could be worth at least three times as much to his new team.\nTurns out, that might have been low-balling the value.\nIn addition to the windfall of corporate sponsorship money, the Dodgers saw increases in ticket sales, merchandising and even tours of Dodger Stadium (the team has been told by Japanese tourism officials that more than 80% of people who visit Los Angeles from the country go to the ballpark during their trip).\nAs Ohtani helped the club to its first full-season World Series since 1988, officials noticed a renewed “buzz in the community,” as chief marketing officer Lon Rosen said, “that means more people are thinking about the Dodgers and buying more merchandise and more tickets and more hot dogs and more everything.”\nWhile the team declined to disclose specific Ohtani-related revenue totals, some reports now estimate the player’s annual influence on the franchise to be in the nine-figure range. Tack on the investment opportunities his salary deferrals create, and the forecasts of him being a billion-dollar profit machine for the franchise seem on track.\n“Because he helps create a winning culture, he makes business better,” Rosen said. “Whether it’s in sponsorship or merchandise or ticket sales. You name it, he does it.”\n“If you’re only going to count the $2 million [of his salary] from this year,” Kasten deadpanned when asked about Ohtani’s impact on the team’s bottom line, “I’m gonna say we cleared that hurdle.”\nAs a result, if the Dodgers weren’t baseball’s biggest financial goliaths before, they might be now.\nWhile the team has consistently carried some of MLB’s highest payrolls since being purchased by Mark Walter’s Guggenheim investor group in 2012, Ohtani’s arrival has triggered a new era of spending never before seen at Chavez Ravine.\nBefore Ohtani, the Dodgers had agreed to six $100-million contracts in club history, and often appeared wary of shelling out monster deals for top free agents.\nIncluding Ohtani, the franchise has now struck five such deals in the last year, most recently landing two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell for $182 million last month.\n“We always have been good, and we always have been aggressive,” Kasten said. “But [having Ohtani] makes us attractive as a landing spot for players. So is there a little bit of striking while the iron is hot? We certainly felt that way. We have a greater offering than ever.”\nRead more: Reliever Blake Treinen and Dodgers agree to two-year, $22-million deal\nGranted, several of the Dodgers’ recent mega-deals have included significant deferrals prompting complaints from some corners of the baseball industry that the deep-pocketed Dodgers are gaining an even bigger economic advantage on the rest of the league. However, each of those deals also come with hefty signing bonuses, including $52 million for Snell, $50 million for Yoshinobu Yamamoto, $30 million for Will Smith and $10 million for Tyler Glasnow.\nIt’s a contract structure that works for all involved parties: The Dodgers get to reduce the hit against their luxury tax payroll, while players preserve the present value of their deals.\nYet, it's a strategy that requires the team to pay a lot of cash up front.\nEnter Ohtani, who structured his contract with the Dodgers explicitly in hopes of enabling the team do exactly that in pursuit of fellow star players.\n“The pledge that we made when we met with him about how aggressive we were going to be to try to win, we feel some responsibility and obligation to fulfill that,” president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said last week.\nWould the Dodgers have been able to spend this big — their 2025 luxury tax payroll is already estimated at over $300 million, with several more signings expected to come — if they didn’t have Ohtani?\n“Fortunately,” Friedman said, “we don't have to spend much time thinking about that alternate reality.”\nOhtani’s financial benefits aren’t entirely exclusive to the Dodgers.\nRead more: Dodgers miss on Juan Soto, but add outfield depth by signing Michael Conforto\nHis popularity has helped promote the sport on a global stage. His first career postseason appearance this year drove up television ratings throughout October. And companies who couldn’t land a sponsorship agreement with the Dodgers have resorted to buying ad space in other clubs’ ballparks for when Ohtani comes to town.\n“That’s power of Shohei,” Rosen said. “It’s almost like a Shohei economy for baseball.”\nNo one, though, has prospered more than the Dodgers.\nThey got a superstar player that keyed a championship run. They got a sponsorship darling that has amplified the team’s revenues. And, just one year into their decade-long partnership, the influence of it all is becoming increasingly more clear, allowing the Dodgers to flex their financial muscles in ways they could have never imagined.\nRead more: Top MLB free agents: Mets land Juan Soto.

        "article_content": "In a 1980 debate with President Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan memorialized the question, “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” It helped Reagan beat the incumbent in that year's presidential election.\nYou are not likely to hear Donald Trump asking the same question about Joe Biden’s presidency. Trump can certainly ding Biden for the inflation that revved up in 2022 and 2023, but he would also prefer that voters forget how the economy was doing in 2020 during Trump’s last year as president.\nFour years ago, of course, the COVID pandemic was causing a brief but traumatic recession that the US economy wouldn’t recover from until Biden’s second or third year in office. We know now that $6 trillion in fiscal stimulus and a comparable degree of monetary magic by the Federal Reserve bounced the nation out of recession in record time. But 2020 was a bad year economically, and in some ways it set the stage for the inflation that has become one of Biden’s biggest electoral liabilities.\nAs COVID lockdowns began early in 2020, a recession began in February and technically ended in April — the shortest recession in records going back to the 1850s. But the end of the recession only meant that the economy stopped shrinking. Economic output didn’t return to pre-COVID levels until early 2021 and employment didn’t recover until the middle of 2022.\nAs part of the Bidenomics Report Card, Yahoo Finance compares the performance of the Biden economy with the Trump economy at the same point in their presidencies. Through the first three years, there wasn’t all that much difference. Job and GDP growth were stronger under Biden. But inflation was higher too. The stock market did well under each.\nBut entering the fourth year of Biden’s presidency, the economics of the two administrations diverge quite a lot, as the following charts show.\nGDP growth has slowed under Biden, but at the same point in Trump’s presidency, it collapsed.\nSame with employment during Trump's fourth year in office. The economy lost 22 million jobs in just two months, from February to April of 2020.\nOne peculiarity of the COVID recession was a surge in reported income. That happened because companies tended to lay off lower-paid workers first, which meant that those who continued to work suddenly had higher average incomes.\nThe stock market also tanked during the COVID outbreak. But it recovered pretty quickly, in large part because the government came to the rescue of corporate profits.\nHardly anybody foresaw it at the time, but the massive shift in spending toward goods and away from services turned out to be a big cause of the inflation that roared in 2022. Also contributing: stimulus payments and other bailout programs that put spending money in people’s pockets and COVID-related supply chain snafus that persisted for several years.\nThe COVID recession wasn’t Trump’s fault. His handling of the pandemic was chaotic and at times absurd, with Trump trying to pretend it was no big deal that thousands of Americans were dying from the virus every day. But the pandemic threw the whole world into a recession, and the United States emerged better than just about anybody.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. \nBy the same token, inflation wasn’t really Biden’s fault. He did sign one of the four major COVID stimulus bills that pumped a lot of excess money into the US economy, but Trump signed the other three. Biden had no control over most of the factors causing inflation, including Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which temporarily sent energy prices soaring.\nYet the COVID recession and “Bidenflation,” as Republicans call it, remain key issues for voters in this year’s presidential election. Polls show that voters trust Trump more on the economy, suggesting that many Americans associate Trump more with the relatively steady pre-COVID economy than with the COVID recession. Biden is trying to flip that by linking Trump with COVID and even asking, \"Were you better off four years ago?\"\nIn the fall of 2020, when the last undecided voters were choosing between Biden and Trump, the economy had started to recover but was still badly damaged. On the Yahoo Finance Trumponomics Report Card, the Trump economy had fallen from a B+ grade before COVID to a C on the eve of the election. Growth and employment were still severely depressed, contributing to Trump’s loss.\nBiden will enjoy a much better economy this fall, with inflation, not growth or jobs, being the main voter concern. Inflation has already fallen from a peak of 9% in 2022 to 3.4%, and could be a bit lower still by Election Day. But Biden still has a lot of skeptical voters to convince.

        "article_content": "The US economy already looks like it's in a recession, Danielle DiMartino Booth says.\nThe chief strategist of QI Research pointed to weakness in the job market, with layoffs rising.\nShe said that put the economy in a rocky state, especially with US debt taking looking like China's.\nThe US economy is already in a downturn — and it could be following in the footsteps of China as the government assumes a growing amount of debt to prop up growth, Danielle DiMartino Booth, a veteran forecaster, says.\nThe chief strategist of QI Research has said for months that the US economy is already in a recession, despite Wall Street's upbeat outlook for a soft landing. But a downturn is evident in the weakening job market, Booth said, pointing to recent downward revisions in monthly job-growth figures.\nThe job market remains on solid footing by historical standards. The economy added a more-than-expected 303,000 jobs in March, while the unemployment rate remained near a record low.\nBut new payrolls were revised slightly lower for the month of February, falling to just 270,000. Meanwhile, layoffs and unemployment have inched higher in recent months, with total discharges rising to 1.7 million in February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\"These revisions, they keep pushing us back further and further from where we thought we were,\" Booth said in a recent interview with Fox Business. \"It seems like every time companies report their earnings, they're doing it with a kicker that says, 'Hey, we're going to lay off 2,000 people or 1,500 people or whatever it is.'\"\nLayoffs could end up rising from 150,000 to 370,000 by the end of the year, Booth said in a previous interview.\nOther economists also foresee a weaker labor market, which raises the risk of a recession. The economy could enter a hard landing by the end of the year and cause the unemployment rate to surge to 5%, David Rosenberg, a top economist, recently said.\nThe economy is already in a rocky position, especially considering ballooning US debt levels, Booth added. Government debt taking makes the US economy look precariously similar to China's, she said, where state-owned enterprises once accounted for as much as 60% of GDP, according to a 2019 estimate from FactSet.\n\"It is not different in any way, shape, or form,\" Booth said of the similarities between America's and China's economies. \"Right now, the public sector is sucking the life out of the private sector.\"\nBooth added: \"We have to spend less as a country to let the private sector really come out and drive the economy.\"\nThe federal debt balance is at a record high of $34.5 trillion, according to Treasury Department data. Ballooning debt levels could eventually spark various problems for the economy, experts have said, including higher inflation, greater market volatility, and a lower quality of life for Americans.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "article_content": "The US labor market added more jobs than expected in May, defying previous signs of a slowdown in the economy.\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the labor market added 272,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in May, significantly more additions than the 180,000 expected by economists.\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9% the month prior. May's job additions came in significantly higher than the 165,000 jobs added in April.\nThe print highlights the difficulty the Federal Reserve faces in determining when to lower interest rates and how quickly. Overall, the economy and labor market have held up, and inflation has remained sticky, building the case for holding rates higher for longer. Yet some cracks have emerged, such as signs of inflation pressuring lower-income consumers and rising household debt.\n“They’re really walking a tightrope here,” Robert Sockin, Citi senior global economist, told Yahoo Finance of the central bank. He noted the longer the Fed holds rates steady, the more cracks could develop in the economy.\nWages, considered an important metric for inflation pressures, increased 4.1% year over year, reversing a downward trend in annual gains from the month prior. On a monthly basis, wages increased 0.4%, an increase from the previous month's 0.2% gain.\nRead more: How does the labor market affect inflation?\n\"To see more confidence that inflation could move lower over time, you'd really like to see the wage numbers look a little lower than we've seen them today,\" Lauren Goodwin, New York Life Investments economist and chief market strategist, told Yahoo Finance.\nAlso in Friday’s report, the labor force participation rate slipped to 62.5% from 62.7% the month prior. However, participation among prime-age workers, ages 25-54, rose to 83.6%, its highest level in 22 years.\nThe largest job increases in Friday's report were in healthcare, which added 68,000 jobs in May. Meanwhile, government employment added 43,000 jobs, and leisure and hospitality added 42,000 jobs.\nThe report comes as the stock market has hit record highs amid a slew of softer-than-expected economic data, which had increased investor confidence that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates as of September. After Friday's labor report, that trend reversed, with investors pricing in a 53% chance that the Fed cuts rates in September, down from a roughly 69% chance seen just a day prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\"We had been anticipating the start of rate cuts in September, totaling [two]cuts this year but the persevering strong employment gains raises the likelihood of later rate cuts,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote of today’s May employment report.\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nOther data out this week has reflected a still-resilient labor market that's showing further signs of normalizing to pre-pandemic levels.

        "article_content": "As the stock market surge in the last month indicates, investors are feeling their most bullish in more than two years.\nBroad-based investor sentiment hit a rating of 4.1 in Bank of America's February Global Fund Manager Survey released on Tuesday, up from 2.9 the month prior and the highest since January 2022. Bank of America noted that cash levels, equity allocation, and economic growth expectations all played a key role in sentiment improvement.\nThe survey of roughly 200 participants with more than $500 billion in assets under management showed that two-thirds of investors expect a soft landing for the economy this year where inflation returns to the Federal Reserve's 2% goal without a severe economic downturn. Notably, investors aren't projecting a global recession for the first time since April 2022.\nThe more positive outlook comes as economic data in the US has largely surprised to the upside this year. And some believe that will continue with the the Atlanta Fed currently projecting economic growth at an annualized pace of 3.4% in the first quarter. Last week, the upside growth prospects, along with little signs of a deteriorating labor market, prompted Deutsche Bank to remove its long-held call that the US economy would enter a recession.\n\"When we first adopted a mild recession as our baseline forecast, a key element was that, with an economy far from the Fed's objectives, the history of central bank-induced disinflations showed the path to a soft landing was narrow if not unprecedented,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a research note on Feb. 5. \"We now think the economy will land on this narrow path and that a recession will be averted with limited cost in the labor market.\"\nAs Luzzetti and others have backed off their recession calls, investors have become more bullish on the overall prospects for the stock market in 2024 as many believe the path forward for interest rates is likely lower. A record 46% of investors described global fiscal policy as \"too stimulative.\"\nThis optimism was seen throughout investor positioning expressed in the survey. Investor allocations to US stocks hit their highest level since November 2021 while the allocation to tech stocks hit its highest point since August 2021.\nThis comes as investors are increasingly moving out of cash positions. Fund managers' average cash level is now 4.2%, a 55 basis point drop from the January survey. Bank of America noted that a greater than 50 basis point drop in cash allocations has typically been followed by an average 4% return for equities in the next three months.\nBut the decline did come with a caveat, as a reading of 4% cash allocations or lower typically triggers a \"sell\" signal, per BofA.\nThe exuberance seen in Tuesday's report has been a hot debate on Wall Street as the S&P 500 recently crossed above 5,000 for the first time ever.\n\"The ways things are going, our upbeat forecast for the S&P 500 of 5,500 at the end of this year may be realised in a matter of months,\" Capital Economics chief markets economist John Higgins wrote in a note on Monday. \"We doubt the rally would end there, though.\"\nHiggins noted that valuations are lower than they were in the tech bubble of the late 1990s and therefore stocks likely have further to run before any proverbial stock bubble is popped. JPMorgan takes a different stance, though.\n\"With the market priced for perfection, equity market internals unhealthy given extreme concentration, elevated investor positioning, expensive valuations, the Fed pushing back on market dovishness, and underappreciated inflation and geopolitical risks, we believe the risk-reward remains unfavorable for equities that are trading at all-time highs,\" JPMorgan chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic wrote in a note to clients on Monday night.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Henry Kissinger didn’t take much interest in the global economy at first–until he did and changed it forever",
        "date": "2024-01-30T10:43:38.000Z",
        "article_content": "Much has been written in the past few weeks about the enormous impact Henry Kissinger had on American diplomacy and the world order over the last seven decades. As his economic advisor for several years while he was the president’s national security advisor and in the years that followed in different capacities in the State Department and then in the private sector, I witnessed–and I hope contributed to– his growing policy role in the global economy.\nFor over half a century, I learned much about how his overall approach to diplomacy, policymaking, and strategy relating to key areas such as Europe, China, and the Middle East sustained America's strong alliances and built a more effective global order. He was my mentor and close friend throughout.\nI began working for Henry in 1969 as a freshly minted graduate student from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy thanks to the recommendation of a former grad there, another great mentor and friend, Fred Bergsten. When he and another colleague, Ernest Johnston, left, I became Kissinger's only economic advisor, with a growing set of responsibilities and a formidable agenda of issues.\nFortunately, I had time to grow into the job because, in those early days, Kissinger had no great interest in economics. So I spent a fair amount of time getting to know and learn from the likes of Paul Volcker (then Undersecretary of the Treasury), Jim Baker (then Undersecretary of Commerce), and Arthur Burns (then Fed Chair).\nKissinger's first consequential engagement on international economic policy came in August 1971.\nAt a secret meeting at Camp David, President Richard Nixon and Treasury Secretary John Connally decided to sever the dollar’s convertibility into gold, force other countries to accept a devalued dollar in order to boost the competitiveness of U.S. exports, and impose a 10% surcharge on their imports into the U.S. Neither Kissinger, nor Secretary of State William Rodgers, nor I were invited. We were not even aware that this meeting was about to happen. Nixon wanted to limit participants to top monetary officials and ensure total secrecy for the final announcement to have the maximum impact.\nNeedless to say, his announcement set off a huge political firestorm amongst America’s friends and allies around the world. I received a less than calm call from Kissinger, then in Paris negotiating with the Vietnamese to seek an end to the Vietnam War, asking “What the hell is going on.” I was tasked with finding out and reporting back to him immediately. I was also peppered with questions from officials of other governments, including several foreign ministers who could not reach Henry while he was in negotiations with the Vietnamese. Fortunately, I was able to get a fairly detailed readout from Volker and Treasury lawyer Mike Bradfield.\nI enquired whether our allies had been informed of this in advance, briefed on the details of the outcome, or told what exactly it was they were being asked to do to get the U.S. to lift the surcharge on their exports. They expressed a combination of anger and profound resentment at being kept in the dark, being hit with a 10% unilateral tariff, and finding out about it on TV. I received calls of a similar tone from officials in the State Department, who were incensed that the White House had blindsided them.\nI immediately began writing a cable to U.S. ambassadors in a wide range of countries giving them as many details as possible–a formidable challenge since I was not at Camp David. All the while, I was briefing Kissinger who, understandably, was now receiving a blizzard of calls from his counterparts. To say that he was also upset with not being briefed in advance and given a chance to comment would be an enormous understatement.\nAs the weeks passed, a series of negotiations produced no deal on how much other countries were expected by Washington to raise the value of their currencies. They also deeply resented the sustained 10% import surcharge that remained on their goods. Tensions mounted with virtually every industrialized country. In his book White House Years, Kissinger wrote that this “was seen as a declaration of economic war.” Over the course of several weeks, I met with Volcker and Burns regularly and briefed an increasingly irritated Kissinger twice daily.\nIncreasingly, our briefings contained information on retaliatory actions others were planning to take. This worried Kissinger who had expected that the problem would be negotiated away relatively soon. He urged me to use my presence as his representative at the various interagency meetings to press hard for rapid progress in the negotiating process, fearing that waiting too long would lead to an international confrontation and gravely damage our alliances.\nI had written him a warning to this effect after conversations with officials of numerous allies and included a suggested negotiating strategy. He made a few adjustments to this strategy regarding how to deal with specific allies such as France, which was the most outraged by U.S. policy and pressures. On my several trips to meet with European officials, my conversations were guided by this strategic approach.\nCiting his negotiating experience and historical knowledge, Kissinger emphasized that the “optimum time to settle was when the other side is still suspended between conciliation and confrontation.” He concluded that “once it has decided on confrontation, (which he feared was not far away) it cannot yield until the test of strength is far advanced.\"\n“My preference,” he frequently emphasized, is “to go along with 'hard-nosed' negotiating for a time but to stop short of an all-out confrontation that would threaten our relationships.”\nBy December, the tone was improving. A full confrontation had so far been avoided and negotiations were moving both sides closer together. At a mid-December summit in the Azores, Nixon and Connally agreed on an acceptable solution. Kissinger was given the task of presenting it to the European leader seen as the decisive voice in whether the Western allies would go along, French President Georges Pompidou. The American plan incorporated some of Pompidou's views, modified to reflect many other European, Japanese, and Canadian concerns. Kissinger and Pompidou worked out a mutually satisfactory compromise, which fully satisfied neither but gave both sides most of their highest priorities.\nThe U.S. had its way in that it no longer had responsibility for converting dollars into gold and the dollar was devalued to a more competitive level. America’s main trading partners secured a lifting of the surcharge and their exchange rates vis a vis the dollar were set considerably lower than the U.S. had originally sought. Washington had learned that excessive use of its economic power risked damaging a vital component of its geopolitical power: allied cohesion.\nThis lesson is one well worth remembering today: Often applied sanctions of various sorts deployed to force allies to bend to our will can lead to adverse reactions, nationalism, and doubts about American reliability. They can fragment our alliances. Thus, thoughtful strategic discussion and often prudent restraint are needed before making such decisions. The whole situation was also a strong signal to Kissinger that he had to pay more attention to economic issues because they had a major impact on international security issues and America’s global leadership.\nEconomics was only a small portion of the issues discussed by the president and Kissinger in the early stages of establishing and building Sino-American relations. At the time, there had been no trade or mutual investment between the two countries for several decades. China was hardly seen as a significant market for American products and had little to sell to the U.S. What products it might have sold were restricted by American laws and regulations that prevented or imposed strict limits on imports of goods from Communist countries, including China. So Sino-American economic relations were hardly on Kissinger’s or my agendas when I first arrived in Washington.\nNevertheless, after Kissinger’s surprise visit, these issues began to inch up the list of priorities. I began to compile a list of possible steps the U.S. could take gradually to begin increasing economic ties. Most of these, at the outset, would be small steps designed not so much because they would have a significant impact on the value or amount of trade, but rather because they would be signals of our desire for closer ties. Further down the road, the focus turned to lifting some U.S. trade restrictions, on generally closer mutual economic engagement, and ways to integrate China into the international economic system, such as supporting its membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.\nDuring his first trip to China, Kissinger had suggested to Premier Zhou En-lai that to help signal a mutual desire for closer ties, there might be a few limited steps with respect to trade relations, but we had not heard back from China on this matter for several months, and thus we assumed a lack of interest in the matter. Zhou, we were aware, was also facing domestic pressures not to get too close to the Americans, and Chairman Mao wanted to focus on bigger issues.\nA bit tired of waiting, we decided on a small move before Nixon left for China on Feb. 17. We announced that China would henceforth be eligible to purchase American commodity exports that could be purchased by several other Communist countries. Previously, Russia and Eastern Europe could purchase certain American products that were banned from purchase by China. This move lifted the ban, putting China on an equal footing with these nations. My recollection is that we received no reaction from Beijing even then, which was a significant disappointment since I had hoped that even a small American gesture at this point would be reciprocated. Subsequently, we concluded that this would be the last unilateral economic gesture we would make to China. Months later, we received signals that what we saw as small gestures had a bigger impact than we had imagined.\nThe signal came from Mao himself. He eventually told us that he had decided \"to expand trade and exchanges.\" While the likely reason for the slowness in responding to our gestures was that Mao needed time to squelch any remnants of opposition, he attributed the slowness to a \"bureaucratic approach.\" But even Premier Zhou had been skeptical. He told a visiting U.S. congressional delegation that China was “disinclined to repeat the misfortunes the nation suffered during the 19th Century in trade with the West.” Mao had never cited this sore point in Chinese history but had earlier insisted “that the major issues had to be settled before smaller issues like trade and people-to-people exchanges could be addressed.” That is likely why China had demurred when Kissinger urged progress on smaller issues such as trade to signal progress on at least a few items. Later, referring to his earlier conversation with Kissinger, Mao said, “ I saw you were right.\"\nUpon returning to Washington, Kissinger recounted this conversation with Mao, encouraging me to dust off my list of possible new trade items, search for other small gestures we could make, and identify ways we could signal to Beijing what we expected in return. Sensing my elation that my earlier work had not been in vain, he pulled out a bowl of candies he always kept handy in his office, offered it to me with a smile, and said I was entitled to a little “extra reward\" for my efforts.\nBoth Nixon and Kissinger were eager to see more trade for another reason as well. They wanted to mobilize U.S. business support for the new relationship with China to counter influential groups within the U.S. who were less than thrilled with our newfound closeness to the country. So when House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and Minority Leader Gerald Ford made a June trip to China and returned with the recommendation that the U.S. create a “non-governmental” or “quasi-governmental” organization to promote trade with China, the president and Kissinger jumped on it. Commerce Secretary Fred Dent and I were asked to work with the business community to set up a group, which became known as the National Council for U.S.-China Trade, to promote trade relations. More than 500 companies attended the opening meeting in May 1973.\nThe diplomatic lessons I drew from this experience still resonate. The first is that there are moments in U.S.-China relations when starting with small successes and confidence-building measures can lead to larger successes and greater trust. This does not mean that larger issues can be ignored since they are critical to our long-term relationship. The second lesson is that the business community is important to the sustainability and support of good Sino-American relations. Nixon and Kissinger both understood this.\nPerhaps the most difficult economic challenge Henry Kissinger faced during his White House years was the combination in 1973 of sharp oil price increases, OPEC production cuts, and an Arab oil embargo aimed at the U.S. and several allied countries. These events also led to intense tensions between the U.S. and some of its European allies.\nDuring the Yom Kippur War, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) recognized that collectively they could dominate the oil market. They imposed an embargo against the U.S. and other nations in retaliation for their resupply of military equipment to Israel and sharply increased oil prices. By the end of the year, OPEC had jacked up the price of oil by nearly 800%. In his book Years of Upheaval, Kissinger called it \"one of the pivotal events in the history of this century.\"\nFrom the outset, Kissinger understood that these actions had the potential not only to do enormous economic damage to the U.S. and many other nations but also to produce deep divisions among the ranks of America’s allies. It did not take long for him to be proved painfully correct. Many allied nations distanced themselves from U.S. policy by seeking to make separate deals with oil producers and refused to share oil with the Netherlands, which went along with U.S. policy. They were concerned that support for the U.S. and the Netherlands would subject them to the embargo as well. Kissinger was adamant that the embargo could not succeed in breaking or even bending U.S. policy. He thought that even giving in partially to Arab demands would merely generate more demands and strengthen the most uncompromising producers. He emphasized instead the need for allied solidarity.\nKissinger’s shuttle diplomacy to achieve a disengagement between Israeli and Egyptian troops and engineer other measures to reduce tensions gave him a sense of the political situation in the Middle East and enabled him to press for the lifting of the embargo.\nI went along on some of these trips, focusing on the latter issue. We quickly saw that the moderate nations we met were faced with a dilemma. As Kissinger put it, “Having resorted to the oil weapon in a moment of high emotion, they found it hard to end it. The requirement of Arab unity in effect gave the radicals a veto.”\nTo turn the situation around, Kissinger took the position that \"we would not carry our diplomacy in the region beyond our first goal of Egyptian-Israeli disengagement unless the embargo was ended–in effect we turned the oil weapon against the producers.\"\nOur diplomacy also benefitted the oil moderates. Once it became clear that the U.S. would not alter its diplomacy or its resolve to end the embargo, the radicals in the region saw no benefit in pushing the Arab moderates to press Washington to make such policy alterations. The same diplomatic posture had a similar benefit for our allies. Kissinger emphasized that we thought we served them best “by stressing their inability to affect our decisions, thereby removing an incentive for producer pressures against them.\"\nAfter months of U.S. pressure and unwavering resolve, and many hours of negotiations, in early 1974, the embargo was lifted.\nThrough a series of diplomatic measures, the U.S. and its allies convened in what came to be known as the Washington Energy Conference–13 oil-consuming countries banding together. Kissinger was careful to stage this as a device for strengthening Atlantic unity to placate allies, some of whom feared that if it were billed as a \"consumer cartel\" it would appear confrontational to OPEC and thus reignite the embargo. And while it did achieve the above goal of Atlantic–and indeed Western–unity, its primary geo-economic objective was to strengthen consumer unity against–and curb the power of–OPEC producers. And from it sprung one of the major new international institutions of our era: the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile there are numerous other topics I could discuss, such as Kissinger’s role in ensuring that the world’s emerging economies were given a greater role in the global economic institutions, thus strengthening the global order, I will stop here with one summary remark. \nThe period that I have been discussing represents a time when geoeconomic and geopolitical issues were rapidly merging and becoming intertwined. Kissinger understood this transition–and his diplomacy enabled it to emerge in a way that avoided major or sustained confrontations and strengthened the global order. We are living with many of the positive results of that today–and facing similar challenges. His lessons and successes should be seen today in historic terms of strengthening the global political and economic order. They are also useful guideposts for current diplomats facing similar difficult challenges.\nRobert Hormats is a former Under Secretary of State for Economic, Growth, Energy, and the Environment, and the author of The Price of Liberty: Paying for America’s Wars.\nEconomic pessimists’ bet on a 2023 recession failed.

        "article_content": "This November, millions of Americans voted to bring Donald Trump back to the White House. Many of them made their decision based on the belief that he would strengthen the economy. However, many economists and financial experts have been sounding the alarm that Trump’s policies could do more harm than good — potentially a lot more harm.\nBe Aware: The Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Retirees Should Make Before Inauguration Day\nCheck Out: 5 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money That Actually Work\nAnthony Scaramucci occupies a unique position among these critics. He worked in the Trump 1.0 administration as White House communications director for such a brief tenure that the term “a Scarmucci” entered the cultural lexicon as shorthand for “a short period of time.” He spent the 2024 election season as one of Trump’s fiercest foes, largely due to the damage he believes Trump’s policies could inflict on the economy.\nScaramucci has gone on record predicting the stock market could crash during Trump’s second term. He argued that plans for mass deportations and tariffs could spike the prices of consumer goods. On an MSNBC panel before the election, he warned that Trump’s policies could “explode the deficit” and that stripping the Federal Reserve of its independence could lead to “a massacre of the local currency.”\nThat sounds dire. But wringing your hands isn’t as helpful as planning ahead. Best-case scenario, Scaramucci is wrong, and you’ve adopted some positive financial habits. If he’s right — at least you’ll be ready.\nTrending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nYou know what they say about eggs and baskets. Just as you don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket, no matter how big and beautiful it may seem, you don’t want to put all your resources in a single investment. To mitigate risk, especially when it comes to your retirement savings, it’s wise to spread out your savings across individual stocks, stock mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nConsider getting even more creative with your investments. For instance, precious metals can provide protection against market volatility. Other options include real estate, bonds, cash value life insurance, annuities, and even alternative holdings, such as oil and gas.\nIf you sense bad times on the financial horizon, having a diversified portfolio gives you the freedom to adjust. You can allocate funds to investments that seem more secure, even if only temporarily. That way, even if the worst happens, you’ll still have a safety net.\nLearn More: 3 Major Retailers Who Will Raise Prices Immediately Under Trump — Tariffs Play Key Role\nWhen difficult periods arise, it’s tempting to stick your head in the sand. Hearing about the latest downturn and economic panic can be overwhelming. But fear shouldn’t drive your financial decisions.\nThe best way to protect your investments is by being clear-eyed about what you own and why you own it. Research every stock in your portfolio and assess its value to you. When alarming headlines hit, you can resist the urge to make hasty decisions. Instead, you’ll know whether to hold onto or let go of specific assets.\nRegularly reviewing your portfolio and having level-headed conversations with a trusted financial advisor can keep your decision-making grounded. This approach helps you avoid rash and potentially damaging financial decisions.\nClearing your debt, especially high-interest debt like credit card balances, is always a smart move. It becomes even more critical during economic downturns that often follow market crashes. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by debt, it might be time to liquidate certain holdings to pay it down.\nReducing your debt before a bear market comes lumbering out of the financial woods puts you in a stronger position to weather challenging times — and to rebound once the bull market charges back into the picture.\nAccording to Anthony Scaramucci, a second Trump presidency could bring significant economic challenges, including a potential market crash. Don’t panic. By diversifying your portfolio, staying informed, and eliminating debt, you can weather any financial storm — and come out stronger on the other side.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Easy Side Hustles You Can Start From Your Couch (No Experience Required)\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and You Can, Too\n5 Financial Steps Most People Never Consider -- and It's Costing Them\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Anthony Scaramucci Predicts a Market Crash Under Trump — Here’s How To Prepare If He’s Right"

        "title": "Why Americans are feeling bad about inflation despite a good economy",
        "date": "2024-05-18T13:03:16.000Z",
        "article_content": "Americans despise inflation.\nIt's a loathing that colors their perception of the economy and their personal finances. And even if the Federal Reserve hits its so-far unmet inflation target of 2%, it won't be enough to soften that revulsion for most people.\nIn fact, if it were up to them, Americans would choose no inflation at all.\nThose are among the findings from a pair of recent studies exploring how Americans feel about inflation, whether those feelings can change, and what policymakers should make of that sentiment.\nThe biggest gripe people have about inflation? How it cuts into their standard of living, forcing Americans to adjust their budgets by buying smaller quantities or lower-quality goods.\n\"It is especially important to understand how people feel about it given that it is clear people suffer from it and have many negative emotional and stress responses to it,\" Stefanie Stantcheva, author of one of the studies and a professor of political economy at Harvard University, wrote to Yahoo Finance.\nCase in point: A record share of Americans say that inflation remains their top financial concern, per a recent Gallup poll. That has weighed down confidence despite robust job growth since the start of 2021 and an unemployment rate that has stayed below 4% for 27 straight months.\nRead more: Inflation slowed in April — here’s how that affects your wallet\nThe topic evokes just as much antipathy now as it did nearly three decades ago.\nThat's when acclaimed economist Robert Shiller set out to discover why consumers dislike inflation so much. What he found still resonates with Americans today, according to Stantcheva's study, which asks many of the same questions as Shiller posed.\nThree-quarters of those in Stantcheva's study believe inflation erodes their purchasing power, nearly the same as the 77% who answered the same way in Shiller's study from 1996. And 80% of respondents in the recent study think prices are outpacing wages, even though hourly wage growth has exceeded inflation since February 2020.\nRead more: How does the labor market affect inflation?\nAmericans also dismiss any positives associated with inflation, with 70% in Stantcheva's study saying \"inflation indicates a poor state of the economy,\" echoing Shiller's findings.\n\"It is interesting to see that the core reasons and feelings are very similar to the mid-1990s despite all the changes the US economy has witnessed since then,\" Stantcheva wrote. \"This suggests that these are deep-seated perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes that are perhaps not as sensitive to current events.\"\nSo what is the ideal inflation rate for Americans? A second recent study teased that out, revealing a huge gulf between what consumers want and the aim of the Fed.\nOn average, Americans prefer a 0.20% annual inflation rate, well below the central bank's 2% target and far from where inflation currently stands — at 3.4% last month.\n\"That's the meat of this project,\" said Raphael Schoenle, one of the researchers of the second study and a professor of economics at Brandeis University. \"Very few people want more than the Fed's perceived target.\"\nDemographics and socioeconomic characteristics are the strongest predictors of people's preferred inflation rate, the study found. For example, older people and those whose income mostly comes from wages prefer lower inflation, whereas those with more assets favor higher inflation on average.\nEconomic reasoning also plays a role — albeit a smaller one.\nThe researchers tested this by exposing survey participants to one of five economic theories — two offering reasons for higher inflation and three providing reasons for lower inflation.\nAfterward, the participants were again asked about their preferred inflation rate and which of the five inflation theories contributed to their preference.\nSeveral theories moved participants' preferred inflation rate, but only one had a statistically significant effect on inflation preferences: that wages don't keep up with inflation and reduce purchasing power.\nAfter being exposed to the wage inflation theory, respondents' preferred inflation rate was 1 percentage point lower than all other theories.\n\"If I wanted one takeaway from this before doing any further studies, [it] is that if you want people to agree with higher inflation, maybe you need to alleviate the concern of inflation eroding their wages,\" Schoenle said. \"Because when they are treated with this idea, they do become more hesitant about higher inflation.\"\nThe distance between what inflation rate Americans find acceptable and what the Federal Reserve prefers complicates its efforts — at least in the court of public opinion.\nWhile the 2% target is the widely accepted standard by central banks around the world, researchers from both studies maintain it's important for policymakers to consider consumer preferences.\nAfter all, Schoenle said, \"Economics is an evolving science … economists don't have one theory that says this is the target we have to have.\"\nUnderstanding preferences shows that folks don't experience inflation in the same way, an important consideration for a central bank trying to keep the economy on solid footing. Even the many measures of inflation vary because they examine different expenditures.\n\"People with different incomes, as well as those living in different places, are facing very different inflation rates because of the basket of goods they consume or how they finance their purchases. This important variation is not well-captured by our standard measures of average inflation,\" Stantcheva wrote.\n\"This is also why it’s so important to not jump to conclusions when comparing perceptions to reality — our measures might not be capturing people’s reality and experiences at all.\"\nJanna Herron is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-02-29T19:07:20.000Z",
        "article_content": "A hard landing is guaranteed for the US, Morgan Stanley's chief US economist has said.\nShe said the full impacts of the Federal Reserve's tightening hadn't been fully felt in the economy.\nIt could take 18 months after the last rate hike to feel the full weight of higher rates.\nA hard-landing recession is certain to come for the economy, and high rates are to blame even as markets start positioning for the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy this year, says Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley's chief US economist.\nSpeaking to CNBC on Monday, Zentner responded to Jamie Dimon's recent comments on the economy, in which the JPMorgan boss warned that the chance of a soft landing was about half of the 70% to 80% odds other forecasters were predicting. He said that was because of several risks still facing the US, including the Fed's tightening campaign, geopolitical conflict, and interest rates, which central bankers have said could remain higher for longer.\nZentner said she was expecting the US to avoid a recession this year as there was no data to support a soon-to-come downturn. But she warned that a hard landing was unavoidable.\n\"We will have a hard landing at some point. I guarantee you that. We're all wondering: When does that come?\" she said. \"The point that Dimon makes is that there are these cumulative impacts that build over time, and we are in the camp that we haven't yet seen all of the tightening impacts from monetary policy,\" she added, referring to the impact of Fed rate hikes.\nFed officials raised interest rates a whopping 525 basis points in 18 months to tame inflation, a move that's taken borrowing costs in the economy to their highest level since 2001.\nEconomists have warned that high interest rates could spark a recession as financial conditions become restrictive and that the full impact of rate hikes probably hasn't been felt, as they typically take about 18 months to fully work their way through the economy.\nSigns of stress are beginning to show in parts of the financial system. Corporate defaults soared last year to their highest level since the pandemic, according to Moody's Analytics. Bank lending has fallen for three straight quarters, according to Fed data.\nStill, signs point to the Fed keeping interest rates elevated as it keeps an eye on inflation. Consumer prices came in hotter than expected last month, with inflation rising 3.1% year-over-year in January.\nZentner predicted that inflation would probably reaccelerate over the first quarter, pointing to the 3.9% growth in core inflation last month. That reacceleration could show up in the next consumer-price-index report, which markets are expecting later this week.\n\"We do expect inflation reacceleration to be temporary, but that is an open question,\" Zentner said, adding that markets might have to consider Fed rate cuts pushed beyond mid-year.\nInvestors had been pricing in ambitious rate cuts to come in 2024, but many forecasters have dialed back their expectations amid hot inflation data. Markets are now pricing in a 39% chance that the Fed could lower rates by 100 basis points or more by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "article_content": "In this article, we will look into the 25 largest economies in the world by 2100. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Largest Economies in the World by 2100.\nThe global economy presents sluggish near-term progress, with the ongoing geopolitical crises and enduring effects of the pandemic. Climate change is another major factor, leading to resource and economic losses due to significant changes in its trajectory. However, the future predictions paint a rather hopeful picture for the global economy. In 2024, the global economy is expected to grow at 3.1% and is expected to grow at 3.2% in 2025, according to the latest economic outlook by the IMF. The recent forecasts are slightly higher than the previously estimated GDP growth in the October 2023 economic outlook. This can be attributed to the strong performance depicted by several countries such as the United States, and policy interventions such as fiscal support in China. The forecast, however, is still below the historical growth average of 3.8%. Inflation is expected to decrease faster than expected and reach 5.8% in 2024, and 4.4% in 2025. This downtrend in inflation, coupled with steady growth, minimizes the risk of a severe economic downturn. The declining inflation presents an opportunity for countries to shift their focus toward fiscal consolidation and targeted policies to improve productivity and long-term growth. Despite the resilient growth projections, several challenges can affect this trajectory, such as a declining population growth rate. The projected population represents a substantial slowdown, compared to previous decades. This shift is expected to impact economic growth, along with factors such as weakened productivity, as predicted by economists.\nOn the contrary, the long-term outlook paints a rather stable picture, especially for Asian economies. According to the forecast by Fathom Consulting, Asian economies such as China and India are expected to lead the global economy with the highest GDP share. The report forecasts China to have a share of 22.68% and reach $101 trillion by 2100. Moreover, Asian countries such as Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines are some other nations, that are expected to emerge as global leaders, in terms of GDP. These countries are also ranked among the largest economies in the world by 2050.\nThe long-term economic landscape presents the potential supremacy of Asian nations such as China and India, along with the established influence of the US. While these macroeconomic trends provide us with a broader picture of the economy, it is pertinent to acknowledge the crucial role that major corporations play in these countries and around the world. Among other factors, businesses across major economic regions are a driver of growth globally. Leading companies such as Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Reliance Industries Ltd (NSE:RELIANCE) are some of the most valuable companies from the biggest countries in the world.\nTencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) is a technology leader in China, operating across Asia and the Pacific, North America, and Europe. The company's stock has surged nearly 8% over the past month, as of February 21. The company has a diverse portfolio of brands including Tencent Pictures, WeiShi, QQ Wallet, Q Zone, QQ Browser, Weixin/WeChat, and QQMail. As of February 21, Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) has a market cap of $349.4 billion.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an established leader in the global market, boasting a market cap of $1.78 trillion, as of February 21. The company reported its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 on January 30. It reported earnings per share of $1.64, beating the estimates by $0.04. Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) revenue for the quarter amounted to $86.31 billion and outperformed estimates by $1.03 billion, with a year-over-year increase of over 13%.\nReliance Industries Ltd (NSE:RELIANCE) is one of the most valuable Indian companies, boasting a market cap of $240 billion, as of February 21. The company is home to 170 in-store brands and has millions of customers all over the country. On January 19, Reliance Industries Ltd (NSE:RELIANCE) announced its results for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. The company reported gross revenue of $29.8 billion, with a 3.2% year-over-year increase. Reliance Industries Ltd (NSE:RELIANCE) also witnessed a growth of 11.4% and 22.8% in its Jio Platforms division and Reliance Retail Ventures Limited.\nNow, let's have a look at the 25 largest economies in the world by 2100.\n25 Largest Economies in the World by 2100\nMethodology\nTo compile our list of the 25 largest economies in the world by 2100, we consulted 'Economics in the Year 2100' by Fathom. It provides data for the estimated percentage share of countries in the global GDP in 2100. It also reports the GDP PPP of the top ten economies. We utilized the data for the GDP PPP value of the top countries and percentage share to calculate the total global GDP value in 2100. Our calculation yielded that the global GDP is projected to be approximately $449 trillion by 2100. After calculating the global GDP in US dollars, we estimated the GDP PPP for the countries to provide insight into their projected values. Our list ranks the 25 largest economies in the world by 2100 in ascending order of their GDP share. We used the population projections for 2100, by the UN, as a tie-breaker for the countries with the same percent contribution to the global economy in 2100.\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "Jerome Powell just revealed a hidden reason why inflation is staying high: The economy is increasingly uninsurable",
        "date": "2024-03-12T21:06:53.000Z",
        "article_content": "Troublesomely high inflation rates may have an overlooked metric at their source: soaring insurance costs. But don't take our word for it, just listen to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nSeveral types of insurance, including home and car insurance, have surged over the past few years, and it’s hurting the Fed’s effort to get interest rates down to its 2% target, Powell said in congressional testimony last week.\n“Insurance of various different kinds—housing insurance, but also automobile insurance, and things like that—that’s been a significant source of inflation over the last few years,” he said.\nOn Tuesday, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that its metric for auto insurance, which covers physical damage, liability, and miscellaneous insurance coverage for private passenger vehicles, increased 20.6% over the past year and climbed 0.9% in February compared to the month prior. Meanwhile, a study from S&P Global Market Intelligence found that homeowners' insurance jumped 11.3% in 2023. Generally, inflation came in slightly higher than expected last month, at 3.2% compared to the same period last year, according to the BLS.\nDriving the increases in insurance are factors such as climate change and rising prices for car parts, experts say.\nThe more frequent extreme weather caused by climate change is leading to higher risk for insurance companies, which has led them to increase their prices, according to a study from Bankrate. Over the past decade, the U.S. has experienced a record $1.1 trillion in damage from severe weather, the most on record, which has contributed to higher insurance costs, the study claimed.\nInsurers pay reinsurance companies to help them avoid insolvency in the case of catastrophic weather events. But because of the increased likelihood of harsh weather conditions that can damage homes, reinsurance companies are charging insurance companies more for their services, and the insurers are passing on the costs to customers, according to Bankrate.\nIn some of the highest-risk areas, insurance companies have even stopped providing their services altogether.\n“In the longer term, companies are withdrawing from writing insurance in some coastal areas,” Powell said, adding, “It’s a significant issue.”\nCar insurance rates are also at a nearly 50-year high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and several factors are to blame including extreme weather and crime, but also the cars themselves, Mark Hamrick, Bankrate’s senior economic analyst, told Fortune.\n\"The road that’s led us to this place includes the sharp rise in the prices of new cars and their complexity, which makes repair more complicated and expensive,” Hamrick said in an email.\nBLS data published Tuesday showed that motor vehicle maintenance and repair costs in U.S. cities increased 6.2% last month compared to a year earlier, outpacing inflation's year-over-year increase of 3.2%.\nAlthough some of the effects of soaring interest rates are unavoidable, Hamrick said consumers can try to get a better deal by adjusting or shopping around for coverage and considering insurance costs when deciding on which car to buy.\nStill, he added that the rising cost of insurance is really a losing situation for consumers.\n\"The sharp rise in auto insurance rates reflects a true collision of several challenging factors, all of which leave drivers in a less-than-optimal place: having to pay more than they expected for coverage.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "title": "Germany’s aging population is dragging on its economy—all of Europe will soon be affected, and it’s only going to get worse",
        "date": "2024-05-29T14:42:04.000Z",
        "article_content": "Germany’s economy has struggled lately, with weak demand and high energy costs blunting growth. But its greatest long-term challenge is likely from a demographic crisis that began decades ago.\nLike most developed societies, Germany’s population is getting older, which means relatively more retired people and fewer workers—a combination that threatens economic growth and public finances.\nThe impact is mild for now, but as the International Monetary Fund warned in a report Tuesday, population aging could cause significant pain a few years down the line.\nNothing. Policymakers have known for decades that Germany’s demographics would increase its dependency ratio: the number of non-workers per worker. It’s just that now it’s starting to have an effect.\nThough innocuous-sounding, the dependency ratio is a vitally important economic measure. All other things being equal, the fewer workers there are relative to the rest of the population, the higher the tax burden on each person who does work, and the lower the per capita output.\nThe IMF predicts that Germany’s annual working-age population growth rate will fall by 0.7% over the medium term—it didn’t define that time frame, but it typically means single-figure years in economics—more than any other G7 country, as baby boomers start retiring and the inflow of immigrants eases.\n“An aging population will…adversely affect public finances as tax revenue growth slows and spending on pensions and health care rises,” the organization said in its report.\nGermany’s pension system, which dates back to 1889, relies on contributions made by currently employed workers to support retired ones. However, the ratio of working to retired people has plummeted from six to one to just two to one since the 1960s.\nAging within the labor force is also a concern. While the effect varies by region and industry, there does seem to be a negative link between workers’ average age and productivity growth in the knowledge economy.\nIt’s going to get worse, and not just for Germany. Japan is the world’s great test case for an aging population, having had low birth rates and negligible immigration for decades. But much of Europe also faces a similar problem.\nTake Greece, for instance. It has the lowest fertility rates on the continent, registering the fewest births in 92 years in 2022. Italy and Finland also have birth rates well below the replacement level, meaning that each new generation is smaller than the ones that went before.\nGermany is due to feel the decline more acutely in the coming years because on its ongoing difficulties with labor shortages. Its economy is already struggling with the effects of cutting itself off Russian energy while coping with high interest rates. That’s on top of other problems that could hurt its long-term competitiveness, including structural barriers like underinvestment and red tape.\nTo be sure, some economic forces are working in Germany’s favor. Inflation has shown signs of cooling, and the country’s unemployment rate is under control compared to some of its neighbors. But the drag from the aging population will only get stronger as time passes.\nThe most obvious way to change this fate, or at least significantly delay it, is through large-scale immigration. The U.K. has taken this approach, for example, with record net immigration in recent years.\n“One key measure of long-term success or less relative decline is your ability to attract migrants, and to incorporate them into the labor force,” Jens Eisenschmidt, Morgan Stanley’s chief Europe economist, told Fortune earlier this month.\nBut that approach is creating political tensions, with far-right parties that typically oppose immigration growing in popularity in various European countries.\nAn alternative is to tap into the parts of the German population that could join the workforce, such as encouraging more women to take on full-time jobs. That could mean incentivizing them if they’re caregivers by offering more childcare support.\nChanges to the current pension system could also help the government account for higher spending obligations on its aging population.\nAnother strategy is to lean into technology. Germany already has a plan to supercharge the use of robots and AI in job functions that face a talent shortage or that can be supported by digitization.\nIn reality, an aging workforce is too formidable a challenge to be fixed by a single measure, or even a handful of them. Instead, governments and businesses will likely need to adapt to it, which, appropriately enough for an issue like old age, will require some long-term thinking.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-09-20T15:04:44.000Z",
        "article_content": "FedEx stock (FDX) tanked nearly 15% Friday morning following a much-worse-than-anticipated quarterly earnings report the day before, highlighting investor concerns over emerging cracks in the US economy.\nFedEx, which is often viewed as a bellwether for the economy, reported profits of $892 million, about 24% lower than analysts anticipated for its fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31. The company also lowered its financial outlook for the fiscal year ahead, projecting earnings per share between $20 and $21 versus its prior range of $20 to $22.\nThe quarterly results came a day after the Federal Reserve made a historically large reduction to interest rates but said the US economy remained strong. FedEx's outlook runs in contrast to that read.\n“The magnitude of the Fed rate cuts yesterday signals the weakness of the current environment,” FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam told analysts in a call Thursday afternoon.\nInvestors seemed to sway toward Subramaniam’s reading of the rate cuts Friday morning, or, at the very least, their initial euphoria faded. After reaching record highs the day before, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.43%. The Dow (^DJI) fell 0.38%, and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped 0.44%.\nFedEx executives attributed the company's poor performance to inflation-squeezed customers shifting away from paying higher fees for its priority shipping. Subramaniam also blamed a “weaker industrial economy” for waning demand for its B2B services, or shipments between businesses and manufacturers. And FedEx is ending its contract with the US Postal Service. Subramaniam said the company expects to take a $500 million hit from the partnership’s termination.\nSubramaniam said the company will continue aggressive cost-cutting efforts, which are expected to save the company $4 billion in the next fiscal year.\nStephens analyst Daniel Imbro offered some hope for FedEx’s future in an interview with Yahoo Finance Friday morning. “We have been recommending buying it here in the $250s, as we think the next 12 months offers a pretty attractive risk-reward from these levels,” Imbro said.\nBut Oppenheimer analysts said they’re taking a wait-and-see approach to FedEx’s cost reduction efforts.\n“With the company integrating its Express and Ground segments into one via its Network 2.0 initiative, we await demonstrated sustained progression toward total company past peak margin levels in a still challenging operating environment,\" they wrote in a note to investors Friday morning.\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam.

        "date": "2024-05-28T08:03:05.000Z",
        "article_content": "A striking disconnect remains in the US economy: continued growth and softening inflation along with Americans' pervasive pessimism and uncertainty about the future.\n\"I think people are just uncertain,\" President Biden recently told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview. \"And that's why we've got to be steady, stay the course, and continue to produce these incredible jobs.\"\nInsight into the disconnect arises from a deeper look into the lifeblood of the US economy: the states, cities, and towns that make it run. Data from the Economic Innovation Group's (EIG) Distressed Communities Index showed that as of 2023, local economies across America still hadn't fully recovered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to EIG, which uses US Census Bureau data to sort districts by economic well-being, roughly 52 million Americans live in a \"distressed\" zip code. That's up from 50 million in 2018.\nDistress scores are calculated based on weighted factors. Those factors include the number of residents with a high school diploma, the poverty rate, the number of adults not working, the housing vacancy rate, the median income ratio, changes in employment, and changes in the number of business establishments.\nEIG discovered that in recent years, urban areas across the country have become increasingly \"distressed\" while the surrounding suburbs are considered more \"prosperous.\"\nTake Cleveland: August Benzow, research lead at EIG, told Yahoo Finance that \"almost every zip code in the city itself is distressed, but then you definitely see a lot of prosperity in suburbs.\"\nThe health of a region’s economy is generally correlated with the size of its population, and the pandemic saw major population changes across the country.\nLarge urban counties, which EIG previously defined as intersecting with \"an urban area with a population of 250,000 or higher,\" have experienced major losses: Between July 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021, those counties saw an aggregate decrease of 812,000 residents.\nAccording to the same report, “exurban and suburban counties continued to grow the fastest in 2022 after seeing major influxes of domestic migration during the early pandemic era.\" After adding 931,000 people in 2021, the same counties added another 832,000 residents in 2022.\n“Obviously, the pandemic has exacerbated this trend as well, where people are able to live further out from cities and still do their jobs either remotely or in a hybrid model,” Benzow said.\nA recent note from Goldman Sachs reiterated this point: \"Domestic migrants have left the largest cities, with about half moving to metro counties with populations of 250k to 1 million. ... The latest figures show that this demographic shift that began at the outset of the pandemic — driven by virus fears and remote work opportunities — not only had not reversed but, in fact, had continued through mid-2023.\"\nThe pandemic also highlighted significant wealth disparities among populations: Those who had the financial means to move out of cities and into suburbs did so, leaving behind lower-income residents in urban areas.\nLook at Fort Worth, Texas. The 13th largest US city by population, Fort Worth saw 4.1% growth (nearly 1 million residents) between 2020 and 2023.\nBut about 32.2% of those residents live in what EIG assessed as \"distressed\" zip codes, compared to 29.2% in \"prosperous\" ones. The urban core of the city is the most distressed area compared to the \"comfortable\" and \"prosperous\" outskirts.\n\"People want to live in a place that has a high quality of life and [where] there’s opportunity for them,\" Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker told Yahoo Finance. \"A lot of the domestic migration you’ve seen across the country into places like Fort Worth is because of that.\"\nAt the same time, the increase in housing demand — between 2020 and 2021, the median property value in the city increased by 11.5% — has exacerbated housing affordability issues.\n\"Mixed-income housing and middle-income housing is a conundrum for a lot of cities, meaning a lot of times there’s always this focus on low-income housing, and there are a lot of tools or government partnerships to make that happen,\" Parker said. \"But oftentimes, the biggest sector of housing that’s missing is middle income. A first-year teacher or first-year firefighter, a young family that can’t afford to live in your city because there’s no middle-income housing available to them.\"\nAccording to the Goldman note, \"stronger population growth outside the largest urban counties has meant somewhat faster house price appreciation relative to pre-pandemic trends compared to the most urban counties. The post-pandemic migration trend is likely connected to changes in housing preferences — more people say in surveys that they would prefer larger, more spread-out homes.\"\nRead more: Why are home prices so high?\nOklahoma City is also facing a mixed economic picture.\nProsperous communities make up 36.3% of the city and its surrounding areas, while distressed ones account for 26.4% — dominated by its urban core.\nThe city’s poverty rate of 15% remains above the national average of 12.6%, while its owner-occupied housing unit rate lags behind the US average by more than 5%.\n\"We’re certainly cognizant of the inequality in our community, and we’re at least trying to do everything we can to address it,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt told Yahoo Finance.\nHolt highlighted the Metropolitan Area Projects program, which in recent years invested heavily in the tourism industry, including for the construction of the Oklahoma City Thunder’s arena. That project is estimated to have created more than 3,000 jobs and generated roughly $590 million per year for the surrounding area.\nHolt stressed that the the city is focused on distressed communities in an attempt to provide more equal opportunity for residents.\n\"We don't promise equal outcomes,\" he said, \"but it’s evident when the outcomes continue to be disproportionate that you’re not really providing equal opportunity.\"\nAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and healthcare policy for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Harris ranks better on the economy than Trump (and Biden)",
        "date": "2024-08-13T18:59:23.000Z",
        "article_content": "It’s been a series of surprises since President Joe Biden stepped down as the Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris replaced him. Harris has surged in the polls. She draws campaign crowds that make Donald Trump jealous. Once-mordant Democrats are now enthused about their odds of beating Trump, the Republican nominee, in this year’s race for president.\nHere’s a particular WTF moment: Voters suddenly seem to rate Harris higher than Trump when it comes to the economy. The latest monthly Financial Times poll finds that 42% of voters say they trust Harris the most to handle the economy, while 41% trust Trump the most.\nThat’s an eye-opener for a couple of reasons. First, voters consistently rated Trump higher than Biden on the economy, and Harris hasn’t done anything at all to distinguish herself from Biden on economic issues since Biden dropped out on July 21. Yet voters rate her 7 points higher on the economy than they rated Biden just one month earlier.\nSecond, voter attitudes on the economy have been the single most important thing Trump has going for him. As is usually the case, voters say the economy is their top political concern, and up till now, Trump has been their go-to candidate on the issue. If Trump loses that edge, it could doom his campaign.\nOn the surface, it’s a mystery why voters would suddenly rate Harris higher on the economy than Biden. There’s been no abrupt improvement in the economy in recent weeks. If anything, the latest employment and spending data shows a slowing economy rather than an accelerating one. Inflation maintains its slow downward trend, but the run-up in food and housing costs that has bedeviled consumers during the last three years is still there.\nThere’s one intriguing clue deep in the FT poll, however, that might explain Harris’s improved rankings on the economy. Sixty percent of respondents say that if Harris wins the presidency, she should adopt different economic policies than Biden. In an open-ended follow-up question, respondents mainly said they want Harris to find better ways of getting inflation under control.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nThat represents good and bad news for Harris. The good news is that some voters seem to be allowing her a reset and exempting her from blame for the inflation they mainly associate with her boss, Biden. The bad news for Harris is that voters may expect a lot more change than she’s likely, or able, to deliver.\nHarris hasn’t yet released her own set of policies, distinct from Biden’s, though her campaign says that is coming soon. Even so, there’s not a lot of room to differentiate herself from the man who soundly defeated her and several other candidates in the 2020 Democratic primaries. Harris can’t go left and embrace progressive policies she backed in 2020, such as Medicare for All and a ban on fracking. That's because that would alienate the moderate swing-state voters crucial to winning the general election in 2024. She can’t go very far to the right, either, as that would turn off progressives and possibly dampen turnout.\nBiden, it turns out, fashioned a set of Goldilocks policies that worked for liberal voters in the Democratic primaries along with more moderate general-election voters. His energy plan, for instance, promotes green renewables through powerful incentives without punishing fossil fuel users. On healthcare, Biden sought to improve the existing system instead of scrapping it and replacing it with a federal solution. On taxes, Biden wants modestly higher rates on businesses and the wealthy instead of wish-list items such as an unworkable wealth tax.\nHarris’s challenge is to cultivate the impression (illusion?) that she's different from Biden, policy-wise, when in fact she won’t be very much. She might get some help from inflation, which is declining to the point that it probably won’t be an issue for the next president. If she comes up with some kind of snappy-sounding plan to bring prices down, she might end up getting credit for something that’s already happening without presidential intervention. She'll also benefit from a likely Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, which will be modest but signal that more cuts are coming and borrowing will get cheaper.\nHarris could also suffer if her differentiation campaign flops and voters start to see her as more of the same. Then again, voters might just be relieved that the 81-year-old Biden is out of the race, with the 59-year-old Harris seeming more energized and capable, whatever the issue.\nA little bit of change and a little bit of youth might go a long way in 2024.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

This is determined by:\nIncreased spending on AI solutions and services driven by accelerated AI adoption\nEconomic stimulus among AI adopters, seeing benefits in terms of increased production and new revenue streams\nImpact along the whole AI providers supply chain, increasing revenue for the providers of essential supplies to AI solutions and services providers\n\"In 2024, AI entered a phase of accelerated development and deployment defined by widespread integration that's led to a surge in enterprise investments aimed at significantly optimizing operational costs and timelines,\" said Lapo Fioretti, senior research analyst, Emerging Technologies and Macroeconomics, IDC. \"By automating routine tasks and unlocking new efficiencies, AI will have profound economic consequences, reshaping industries, creating new markets, and altering the competitive landscape.\"\nImpact on Employment - New Roles Emerge While Others Remain Resilient\nThe majority of respondents to IDC's Future of Work Employees Survey expect some (48%) or most (15%) parts of their work to be automated by AI and other tech over the next two years, while only a minority (3%) of employees expect their jobs to be fully automated by AI.\nWhile some work will be negatively impacted by the proliferation of AI, new positions such as AI Ethics Specialists and AI Prompt Engineers will emerge as dedicated roles within global organizations.\nThe research further indicates that a \"human touch intensity,\" combined with the level of \"task repetitiveness\" by which each job is characterized, will inform organizations about roles that are subject to a full AI and automation replacement, versus those where tech's role will be to augment human capabilities. As such, positions where human social and emotional capabilities are critical, such as nursing and roles where decision-making encompasses ethics and comprehension beyond numbers will remain robust.\n\"Understandably, we're all curious to know if AI will replace our jobs,\" said Rick Villars, group vice president, Worldwide Research, IDC. \"As a CEO interviewed by IDC's Andrea Siviero said, 'Based on this research it's clear that we should be asking ourselves how our jobs can be made easier and better by AI. AI will not replace your job but someone who knows how to use AI better than you will.'\"\nResearch Methodology\nTo estimate the overall economic impact of a technology or a service, IDC developed an economic impact methodology that combines IDC knowledge of the market and internal data with a standard analytical framework, known as an Economic Impact Analysis. It leverages an input-output (I/O) framework, using the most updated input-output official tables of a specific economy: through I/O tables, specific multipliers are determined and applied to the specific technologies to calculate the related effect. This IDC Economic Impact Analysis evaluates three types of impact on the economy. In this AI-specific model, these are:\nDirect Effect - includes revenues from artificial intelligence business solutions/services providers directly selling their products to end users.\nIndirect Effect - refers to the economic impact related to the AI supply chain and AI adopters' benefits. It includes the effects that organizations/tech providers have on the region or country due to their operations related to AI provision.\nBackward indirect effects refer to the economic effects on supply chains and industries that provide inputs to AI-driven sectors — in other words, revenues generated in local industries impacted by AI.\nForward indirect effects refer to the effects on AI adopters, excluding consumers, that benefit from the adoption of AI technology, in terms of productivity, revenue growth, and other business parameters.\nInduced Effect - these are effects induced by the increase in production. It refers to the impact, due to economic stimulus, from an increase in household income, including existing and new employees linked to the AI value chain across direct and indirect effects layers. People will spend part of their wages in the economy, thus generating additional economic impact.\n\"The importance of economic impact models is increasing. This type of analysis can be of importance for any vendor who wants to understand the impact of its specific products or services in a short or medium-term period. It helps not only businesses but also governments and other stakeholders make informed decisions by evaluating the potential benefits of a technology investment, for example, to the economy,\" said Carla La Croce, research manager, Data and Analytics, IDC.\nThe IDC report, The Global Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Economy and Jobs: AI will Steer 3.5% of GDP in 2030 (Doc #US51057924), assesses the impact of artificial intelligence in terms of economic output and employment. This assessment leverages IDC's knowledge of the market and internal data, as well as IDC's Economic Impact model, which considers the direct, indirect, and induced effects of AI in the economy. The study delves into the global impact of AI on the economy, diving deep into specific regions, technology layers, and industries. The goal is to assess AI's cumulative contributions to the economy with respect to the forecast global GDP in 2030.\nAbout IDCInternational Data Corporation (IDC) is the premier global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets.

        "date": "2024-05-14T01:18:33.000Z",
        "article_content": "The US will keep growing for several quarters, but 2025 will see a hard landing, Apollo's Torsten Slok told Bloomberg TV.\nDebt is fueling the growth, and both consumers and corporations are already feeling distress.\nThese problems will come to the forefront when unemployment starts to meaningfully rise.\nThe US economy will stay afloat through the next few quarters, but growth drivers could turn into headwinds as soon as next year, Torsten Slok said.\nAccording to the Apollo chief economist, that's because current strength stems from high debt loads, both among US consumers and the corporate world. Eventually, those trends will start to falter, triggering a hard landing in 2025.\nSlok pointed out that delinquencies are rising on credit cards and auto loans, despite an economy with low unemployment. Meanwhile, economic momentum hasn't done away with highly-levered firms, which extend across industries.\n\"That tells you once people do begin to lose their jobs, once the economy does begin to slow down, you already have a lot of distress,\" he told Bloomberg TV. \"Imagine what the process would look like if you finally get the unemployment to move higher.\"\nSlok also pointed to commercial real estate, a sector that's been the source of widespread fears amid higher interest rates. These hikes have caused borrowing costs to rocket for the industry, and many fear a tsunami of debt defaults if rates don't come down soon.\nOffice properties have been a particular sore spot, impacted heavily by remote work and faced with declining values. In April, office loans made up 54% of new 60+ delinquency volumes, Fitch Ratings reported last week.\nFor his part, Slok expects the Federal Reserve to deliver no rate cuts this year, citing that it would require a dramatic slowdown for the central bank to meet its 2% inflation mandate anytime soon.\nBut while that keeps a hard landing on the table, the next few quarters will still deliver solid performance, he said.\n\"We still have behind us a very strong tailwind. That comes from easy financial conditions,\" he said, adding: \"And on top of that we also have a tailwind from fiscal spending. We still have strong spending in the pipeline from the Chips Act, Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Act.\"\nLooking into 2025, others have also cited caution, citing deteriorating labor-market conditions as proof of a looming recession.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "date": "2024-10-08T10:00:59.000Z",
        "article_content": "For the record:8:26 a.m. Oct. 8, 2024: An earlier version of this post incorrectly described the committee’s estimates on the direct cost of Harris’ proposal to extend and increase the health insurance subsidies created by the Affordable Care Act and improved by the Biden administration.\nIf you are wired into the flow of campaign news — as I am, for my sins — you will be inundated this week with reports of a new analysis of the fiscal impact of the economic proposals of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.\nLong story short: Trump's would be much worse in terms of increasing the federal debt than Harris'. According to the study issued Monday by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Harris' policies would expand the debt by $3.5 trillion over 10 years, Trump's by $7.5 trillion.\nThese are eye-catching figures, to be sure. They're also completely worthless for assessing the true economic effects of the candidates' proposals, for several reasons.\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics, on Trump's deportation plan\nOne is the committee's single-minded — indeed, simple-minded — focus on the direct effects of the proposals on the federal deficit and national debt. That's not surprising, because (as I've reported in the past) the CRFB was created to be a deficit scold, funded by the late hedge fund billionaire Peter G. \"Pete\" Peterson.\nFor instance, the CRFB has been a consistent voice, as was Peterson, in campaigns to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits on the preposterous grounds that the U.S., the richest country on Earth, can't afford the expense. (Peterson's foundation still provides a significant portion of the committee's budget.)\nThis focus on the national debt and the federal deficit as a linchpin of economic policy dates back to the 1940s among Republicans and the 1970s among Democrats. Throughout that period it made policymaking more austere and left the country without the resources to address real economic needs such as poverty while increasing inequality.\nThe harvest, as economist Brad DeLong of UC Berkeley has noted, was the rise of a policy that failed everyone but the rich. Trump would continue that policy; Harris would continue the Biden administration's effort to return the U.S. to a government that serves all the people.\nAnother problem with the analysis is that the candidates' proposals are inchoate — as the committee acknowledges. The committee cobbled together their purported platforms from written policy statements, social media posts and dubious other sources and then absurdly claimed that its effort helped to \"clarify [the] policy details.\"\nRead more: Column: I know what Trump was really talking about in his child care rant, and it's even scarier than you thought\nThe worst shortcoming of the CRFB's analysis is that it's hopelessly narrow. Its focus is on the first-order effects of the individual proposals on federal income and spending, without paying much attention to the dynamic economic effects of those policies. Would the policy spur more growth over time, or less?\nThe committee estimates the direct cost of Harris' proposal to extend and increase the health insurance subsidies created by the Affordable Care Act and improved by the Biden administration at $350 billion to $600 billion over 10 years; but what would be the gains in gross domestic product from reducing the cost of healthcare for the average household? The committee barely even acknowledges that this is a salient issue. It says that in some of its estimates it accounts for \"dynamic feedback effects on revenue and spending,\" but also says, \"we do not account for possible changes in GDP resulting from the candidates’ policies.\"\nThe committee's treatment of Trump's tariff proposals demonstrate the vacuum at the heart of its analysis. It treats the income from Trump's proposal — a 10% to 20% tariff on most imported goods and 60% on Chinese imports — as a revenue gain for the federal budget. Economists are all but unanimous in regarding tariffs as a tax on American consumers, however — in other words, a tax transferring household income to the Treasury.\nThe committee writes: \"Such a significant change to trade policy could have economic and geopolitical repercussions that go beyond what a standard tax model would estimate.\" As a result, \"the true economic impact is hard to predict.\" Thanks for nothing.\nUncertainties about the details of the candidates' proposals resulted in laughably wide ranges in the committee's fiscal estimates. The effect on the deficit and debt of Harris' proposals is estimated at zero to $8.1 trillion over 10 years. For Trump's plans, the range is $1.45 trillion to $15.15 trillion. What are voters or policymakers supposed to do with those figures?\nThe CRFB also reports a \"central\" estimate for both — $3.5-trillion expansion of debt for Harris, $7.5 trillion for Trump — but doesn't say much about how it arrived at those figures, other than to say that sometimes it just split the difference between the high and low estimates, and sometimes relied on estimates of the individual proposals by the Congressional Budget Office and the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\nRead more: Column: America's retirement system is mediocre. The new House speaker wants to make it downright awful\nI asked the CRFB to comment on the shortcomings listed above, but haven't received a response.\nDespite all that, the CRFB analysis showed up on the morning web pages of major newspapers and other media coast to coast on Monday, as though its conclusions were credible, solid and bankable. (Here at The Times, we passed.)\nConsider the CRFB's treatment of Trump's deportation policy, which he has called the \"largest deportation program in American history,\" affecting at least 11 million undocumented immigrants and millions more who are in the U.S. legally.\nThe committee says that might increase the deficit by anywhere from zero to $1 trillion over a decade, with a middle-of-the-road estimate of $350 billion — \"chiefly,\" it said, \"by reducing the number of people paying federal taxes.\" It also cites unspecified \"additional economic effects of immigration.\"\nThe CRFB might have profited from reading an analysis of the deportation proposal produced in March by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which was also funded by Pete Peterson but, staffed by economic eggheads with a wider intellectual horizon, tends to take a more intelligent approach to economic policy.\n\"The immigrants being targeted for removal are the lifeblood of several parts of the US economy,\" the institute observed. \"Their deportation will ... prompt US business owners to cut back or start fewer new businesses, ... while scaling back production to reflect the loss of consumers for their goods.\"\nRead more: Column: The Biden economy is booming. Why aren't Americans happier with it?\nThe institute cited estimates that a deportation program in effect from 2008 to 2014 cost the jobs of 88,000 U.S. native workers for every 1 million unauthorized immigrant workers deported. Arithmetic tells us that, in those terms, deporting 11 million immigrants would cost the jobs of about 968,000 U.S. natives.\n\"The disappearance of migrant workers ... dries up local demand at grocery stores, leasing offices, and other nontraded services,\" the institute reported. \"The resulting blow to demand for all workers overwhelms the reduction in supply of foreign workers.\"\nThe institute was a lot more free-spoken than the CRFB about the effect of Trump's proposed policies on economic growth. Considering only the deportations, tariffs and Trump's desire to exercise more control over the Federal Reserve System, it concluded that by the end of Trump's term, U.S. GDP would be as much as 9.7% lower than otherwise, employment would fall by as much as 9%, and inflation would climb by as much as 7.4 percentage points.\nAn overly sedulous focus on deficit reduction as economic policy has caused \"real harm [for] the nation's most vulnerable groups, including millions of debt-saddled and downwardly mobile Americans,\" economic historian David Stein of the Roosevelt Institute and UC Santa Barbara wrote last month. When it became Democratic orthodoxy under Presidents Carter and Clinton, the party pivoted to \"'Reagan Democrats' and suburban white voters at the expense of the labor and civil rights movements.\"\nAs the federal government pulled back, \"state budgets were ravaged,\" Stein wrote. State and local services were slashed. The efforts to control federal debt forced households to take on more debt.\nThe deficit scolds are still at it and still have vastly more credibility than they deserve. That's clear from the CRFB's analysis and the alacrity with which it was republished as \"news\" Monday. Efforts to turn policy back to the point that it benefits everyone, not just the rich, still have a long way to go in this country.\nGet the latest from Michael HiltzikCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.Sign me up.\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times."

        "date": "2024-01-27T00:47:50.000Z",
        "article_content": "The narrative that the US economy could achieve a soft landing still faces challenges, Mohamed El-Erian told Bloomberg TV.\nRising inflation and geopolitical turmoil could dampen US growth and pressure a recession.\nLast year's rapid growth is unlikely as consumer savings are depleted, he said.\nMarket confidence in a US soft landing ignores three vulnerabilities that still pose a recessionary threat, economist Mohamed El-Erian told Bloomberg TV.\nThough recent quarterly GDP growth has exceeded expectations, and inflation has broadly climbed lower in late 2023, it's not a given that these trends should continue.\n\"There's a real risk that growth slows to the one to one and a half percent level, with downside that we may slip into a negative quarter,\" he outlined.\nThe first headwind is a slowdown in consumer spending, dimming a key driver of last year's high-pace growth. Pandemic-era savings that boosted Americans' will to spend are now depleted, El-Erian said, marked by mounting household debt.\nWells Fargo recently shared similar concern, noting that holiday spending strength was a \"last hurrah,\" instead of a signal of more to come. The bank expects a noticeable mid-year slowdown, contrasting Wall Street's soft landing consensus.\nSecondly, inflation will also keep a recession on standby, as it's no given that it won't rebound, El-Erian warned. While November's surprisingly slower price growth sparked market bets that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates, inflation ticked back up in December.\n\"I've said we are in the sweetest spot of the inflation reduction right now. It's going to get tougher going forward,\" he said. \"And we've already seen from Europe that it's not out of the question that, not only does inflation stabilize, but once in a while you get the rate going up.\"\nWorsening geopolitics pose a third challenge to growth, he added. Supply chain disruptions and delayed shipments are bound to pressure more price upside.\nIt's a consequence of turmoil in the Red Sea shipping lane, where attacks on cargo vessels by Yemen's Houthi rebels have resulted in a major reroute around Africa. As this adds to travel time, shipping rates have gone up, with other analysts warning that this could trigger a second bout of global inflation.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "article_content": "In the years following Ronald Reagan’s presidency in the 1980s, many Americans came to regard inflation as the economic equivalent of smallpox: a scourge largely eradicated.\nIt wasn’t, obviously. After a 30-year dormant period, inflation reemerged in 2021, becoming the biggest challenge of Joe Biden’s presidency. Inflation has now dropped far below its 2022 peak, but many prices that went up have stayed up, and Americans are peeved about food, rent, and transportation costs that seem to be taking a permanently bigger bite out of their paychecks.\nThe scarring effects of inflation have fueled a kind of nostalgia regarding Donald Trump’s presidency, from 2017 to 2021. In a recent NBC News poll, 40% of respondents said Trump’s presidency was better than expected, a higher portion saying so than when NBC asked the same question in 2018. Voters consistently say they trust Trump more than Biden on the economy, a crucial deficit for Biden given that the two men are vying for the presidency once again this year.\nFond recollections of the Trump economy aren't the same as a yearning for more of Trump, who led a chaotic response to the COVID pandemic, tried to overturn the 2020 election, and stoked the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the Capitol. But the pre-COVID Trump economy is now a baseline people measure Biden's performance against. Trump is running on his own economic record, and against Biden's, so the recent past matters in 2024.\nTrump inherited a solid economy from President Obama, and the good times continued into 2020. Compared with today, there was no inflation to speak of. Voters who think their paychecks went further under Trump are generally right.\nRead more: Inflation update on everyday expenses: Prescription drugs down, pet care way up\nThe two charts below show inflation in 26 key categories Yahoo Finance has been tracking since 2021. The figures represent total inflation during the first three years of Trump’s presidency and Biden’s. Click on each president’s name to see the data.\nUnder Trump, overall inflation was just 6.2% during this first three years. Under Biden, it was 17.9%. Rents rose 11.3% under Trump and 19.5% under Biden. Grocery inflation: 2.4% under Trump, 21% under Biden. Transportation, including the cost of vehicles, insurance, maintenance, and gasoline: Up 4.5% under Trump, and up 27.5% under Biden.\nThere are a couple of areas where inflation is actually lower under Biden than under Trump: healthcare, college tuition, and prescription drugs. That’s probably due to slacking demand for all three during COVID, which is a temporary factor not likely to last.\nReal earnings, adjusted for inflation, have also been stronger under Biden. They’ve risen 15.4% in three years, compared with just 9.4% for Trump. Under Biden, however, inflation has risen 2.5 percentage points more than earnings, which means purchasing power is down. Under Trump, earnings outpaced inflation by 3.2 points, so purchasing power is up. This is the real advantage Trump has over Biden: People feel their money buys less than it did four years ago, and the data backs them up.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nBiden can’t refute that fact. What he can do when lobbying for his economic policies is try to convince people of three things: One, inflation wasn’t his fault, given that it was a global phenomenon driven largely by COVID-related shortages and disruptions. Two, things are getting better, not worse. And three, Biden’s economic plan will be better for voters in the future than Trump’s.\nSkirting the blame for inflation will be tough. Biden’s campaign message is that greedy corporations are responsible for squeezing consumers, a claim some voters seem willing to accept. Yet inflation happened on Biden’s watch, and some voters think Biden’s hostility to fossil fuels and penchant for big spending set the stage for inflation. At this point, he seems unlikely to change many minds.\nBiden may have better luck persuading voters that things are getting better because they actually are. Inflation is down from 8.9% in 2022 to 3.1% now, and shoppers are starting to notice. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, which emphasizes inflation when polling respondents, has shot up during the last two months, largely because fears of future inflation are declining. Incomes are now rising by more than inflation, which means Americans will start to feel better off if the trend continues.\nAs for the best economic plan, Biden and Trump are both running on their records, which seems to favor Trump for those who prioritize economic issues. If inflation continues to abate, voters may give Biden more credit for a strong job market, a boom in factory construction, his efforts to ease student debt burdens, and his insistence that he’ll “finish the job” if voters give him another four-year term. Maybe voters will reminisce fondly about the Biden economy someday.\nRead more about the latest inflation data and what it means for markets:\nInflation: Consumer prices rise 3.1% in January, defying forecasts for a faster slowdown\nHot inflation reading reinforces the Fed's cautious approach to rate cuts in 2024\nUS stocks fall after inflation cools less than anticipated\nCost of eating out continues to rise, a potential hit to restaurant chains\nGas prices fell last month on lower seasonal demand\nCPI: A little good news for shelter costs?\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "In this article, we will look at the 5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy.\nThe United States of America, China, and Germany are some of the most powerful countries in the world by economy. Factors including strong GDP growth, low inflation rates, increased employment opportunities, and strong investment determine a country’s economic power. In addition to these factors, the overall world economic outlook also contributes to the economic performance of these countries. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) April 2024 update, the world economy grew at 3.2% in 2023 and is forecasted to continue growing at the same rate in 2024 and 2025. The advanced economies of the world are expected to witness a slight increase in growth rate and are forecasted to grow at 1.7% in 2024 as compared to a 1.6% growth rate in 2023. On the other hand, growth for emerging and developing economies is expected to slow down modestly from 4.3% in 2023 to 4.2% in 2024.\nGlobal headline inflation is easing and was close to the pre-pandemic level in late 2023 for most economies. During the last quarter of 2023, headline inflation was recorded to be 2.3% down from 9.5% in the second quarter of 2022 in a quarter-wise analysis. While headline inflation for emerging and developing countries has also cooled down from its peak of 13.7% in the first quarter of 2022, it is still considerably high and was recorded at 9.9% in the last quarter of 2023. The mean inflation rate for developing countries is high due to uncontrolled inflation in some countries. For instance, on May 3rd, Reuters reported that annual consumer price inflation in Turkey climbed up by 69.8% in April, the rise was still below expectations, however, it was the highest since late 2022. The Finance Minister of Turkey, Mehmet Simsek, said that though inflation will peak in May, it will start to ease sharply to be in line with the government's prediction. If you want to read more about economies of the world you can look at 12 European Countries with the Best Economy Right Now and 30 Countries with the Best Economy in the World Right Now.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) are two of the leading companies leading the global economy. Let's discuss some updates from them.\nOn May 8th, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced $3.3 billion in Wisconsin to strengthen artificial intelligence economic activity, innovation, and job creation. The investment package is designed to upgrade Southeast Wisconsin as a hub of cloud computing, and will also lead to the building of the country's first manufacturing-focused Artificial innovation lab. Moreover, the initiative also aims to address the skill gap within the state and will help equip over 100,000 residents with essential AI skills. The president of the United States, Joe Biden along with the president of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Brad Smith announced this new investment package at Gateway Technical College.\nSaudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) is an integrated energy and chemical company based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with operations running internationally. The company operates in the upstream and downstream segments and deals with the exploration, development, and production, of hydrocarbon products, and other related chemicals. On April 27th Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) announced that it is exploring a joint venture in its Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Company with its Chinese partner Rongsheng Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (SHE:002493) as a new downstream partner. Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222) recently signed a cooperation framework agreement that envisions Rongsheng Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (SHE:002493) acquiring 50% of the stake in the Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Company. The agreement also lays the foundation for the development of liquid-to-chemical expansion projects at the refinery. The Aramco Downstream President, Mohammed Y. Al Qahtani, said that this partnership is a step towards key geographical expansions and to attract investment in the Saudi downstream sector.\nWith that, let’s look at some of the most powerful countries in the world by economy.\n5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy\nOur Methodology\nTo create the list of 5 most powerful countries in the world by economy, we relied on four main economic indicators including GDP at current prices, real GDP growth rates, GDP per capita (PPP), and GDP per capita growth rates, all sourced from IMF. We used the GDP at current prices as our primary metric to rank the countries. GDP is one of the most commonly used single measures to gauge a country’s overall economic activity and represent the total value of all the final goods and services produced within a country during a year. We have used recent data for 2024 for all of our indicators. The list is arranged in ascending order of countries' GDP.\nGDP Current Prices (2024): $3.937 trillion \nReal GDP Growth Rate (2024): 6.8%\nGDP Per Capita (PPP) (2024): $10,120\nGDP Per Capita Growth Rate (2024): 9.00%\nIndia ranks 5th on our list of the 20 most powerful countries in the world by economy. It is also one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia. The country has a GDP of $3.937 trillion, with a growth rate of 6.8%. Moreover, the country’s GDP per capita is growing at 9.00% during 2024.\nGDP Current Prices (2024): $4.110 trillion\nReal GDP Growth Rate (2024): 0.9%\nGDP Per Capita (PPP) (2024): $54,180\nGDP Per Capita Growth Rate (2024): 1.78%\nJapan ranks 4th on our list of most powerful countries in the world by economy.

        "date": "2024-10-12T06:03:31.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Kevin Yao and Joe Cash\nBEIJING (Reuters) -China pledged on Saturday to \"significantly increase\" debt to revive its sputtering economy, but left investors guessing on the overall size of the stimulus package, a vital detail to gauge the longevity of its recent stock market rally.\nFinance Minister Lan Foan told a press conference Beijing will help local governments tackle their debt problems, offer subsidies to people with low incomes, support the property market and replenish state banks' capital, among other measures.\nThese are all steps investors have been urging China to take as the world's second-largest economy loses momentum and struggles to overcome deflationary pressures and lift consumer confidence amid a sharp property market downturn.\nBut Lan's omission of a dollar figure for the package is likely to prolong investors' nervous wait for a clearer policy roadmap until the next meeting of China's rubber-stamp legislature, which approves extra debt issuance. A date for the meeting has yet to be announced but it is expected in coming weeks.\nThe press conference \"was strong on determination but lacking in numerical details,\" said Vasu Menon, managing director for investment strategy at OCBC in Singapore.\n\"The big bang fiscal stimulus that investors were hoping for to keep the stock market rally going did not come through,\" said Menon, adding this may \"disappoint some\" in the market.\nA wide range of economic data in recent months has missed forecasts, raising concerns among economists and investors that the government's roughly 5% growth target this year was at risk and that a longer-term structural slowdown could be in play.\nData for September, which will be released over the coming week, is expected to show further weakness, but officials have expressed \"full confidence\" that the 2024 target will be met.\nNew fiscal stimulus has been the subject of intense speculation in global financial markets after a September meeting of the Communist Party's top leaders, the Politburo, signalled an increased sense of urgency about the economy.\nChinese stocks reached two-year highs, spiking 25% within days since that meeting, before retreating as nerves set in given the absence of further policy details from officials. Global commodity markets from iron ore to industrial metals and oil have also been volatile on hopes stimulus will stoke sluggish Chinese demand.\nReuters reported last month that China plans to issue special sovereign bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284.43 billion) this year as part of fresh fiscal stimulus.\nHalf of that would be used to help local governments tackle their debt problems, while the other half will subsidise purchases of home appliances and other goods as well as finance a monthly allowance of about 800 yuan, or $114, per child to all households with two or more children.\nSeparately, Bloomberg News reported that China is also considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan of capital into its biggest state banks, though analysts say more lending firepower will come up against stubbornly weak credit demand.\nSTIMULUS STEP-UP\nThe central bank in late September announced the most aggressive monetary support measures since the COVID-19 pandemic, including interest rate cuts, a 1 trillion yuan liquidity injection and other steps to support the property and stock markets.\nWhile the measures have lifted market sentiment, analysts say Beijing also needs to firmly address more deeply-rooted structural issues such as boosting consumption and reducing its reliance on debt-fuelled infrastructure investment.\nMost of China's fiscal stimulus still goes into investment, but this leads to debt outpacing economic growth as returns are dwindling.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates central government debt at 24% of economic output. But the fund calculates overall public debt, including that of local governments, at about $16 trillion, or 116% of GDP.\n\"There is still relatively big room for China to issue debt and increase the fiscal deficit,\" said Lan.\nHe added local governments still have a combined 2.3 trillion yuan to spend in the last three months of this year, including debt quotas and unused funds. Municipalities will be allowed to repurchase unused land from property developers, he said.\nLow wages, high youth unemployment and a feeble social safety net mean China's household spending is less than 40% of annual economic output, some 20 percentage points below the global average. Investment, by comparison, is 20 points above.\nChinese officials have repeatedly pledged over the past decade to increase efforts to boost domestic demand, but made little progress on that front, which would require a fundamental structural re-think of many policies and institutions.\nLan said more reforms will be announced \"step-by-step.\"\n\"The focus seems to be around funding the fiscal gap and solving local government debt risks,\" Huang Xuefeng, credit research director at Shanghai Anfang Private Fund Co, said of the press briefing.\n\"Without arrangements targeting demand and investment, it's hard to ease deflationary pressure.\"\n(Reporting by Joe Cash, Kevin Yao, Ellen Zhang and Ankur Banerjee; Writing by Eduardo Baptista and Marius Zaharia; Editing by Kim Coghill)"

        "article_content": "When exit polls began to be released on Tuesday night, it appeared to contain a nugget that augured well for Kamala Harris. In the end, it didn't.\nAmericans were asked who they trusted more to handle the economy. It was a win for Donald Trump — 51% picked him to 47% for Harris — but it was a much more narrow victory than would have been imaginable earlier this year when the former president was trouncing President Joe Biden regularly on the issue.\nIt seemed to be a validation of a strategy for Harris in the final few days of the campaign to focus on the economy — which is called the top issue for voters so much it can feel like a cliché — and tout her plans to bring down the prices of things like groceries and housing.\nBut those results clearly boded nothing of the sort. Trump, in the hours that followed, romped to a decisive victory that saw him win crucial battlegrounds as well as be on track to win the popular vote for the first time in his three runs for office.\n\"I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran it,\" Harris said Wednesday afternoon as she conceded the race. \"We must accept the results of this election.\"\nThere are many answers to what caused Trump's win and Harris's loss but one clear factor appears to be a recent decline in Americans (especially Democrats this year at least) who say the economy is their top issue.\nIn 2012, the exit polls found a whopping 60% of all voters picked the economy as their top issue. This year, the result was barely half that with 31%.\nIn addition to this overall decline in voter focus on the economy, this year's batch of exit poll data found that, for the first time in years, the economy did not rank as the top Election Day issue. Voters narrowly ranked democracy as their top issue.\nThe results were even more striking among Harris supporters. The economy was fourth in that group with Democrats also more attuned to abortion and foreign policy, in addition to democracy.\nThis downplaying of economic issues was also seen in another measure of voter preferences: the AP Votecast, a survey of more than 115,000 voters nationwide.\nIt also found vastly different motivations among voters, with the voters who actually pulled the lever for Harris looking at other issues first.\nThe survey found democracy appeared to be a primary driver for Vice President Harris’s supporters, while Trump’s supporters focused on immigration and inflation.\nThe economy was the top issue, at 39%, but with many more choices presented, less than 4 in 10 voters answered the economy was the top issue — mirroring the exit polls in that respect.\nAnd Tuesday night exit poll results found that, while Harris did gain when it came to voters' trust on the economy, it did little to help her with those who consider the economy their topic issue.\nThat 31% of voters who picked the economy as their top issue broke decisively for Trump, 79% to 20%.\nLee Carter, president of Maslansky + Partners, said Wednesday in a Yahoo Finance appearance that the twin issues of inflation and immigration \"sealed the deal\" for Trump.\n\"People feel really really negatively about the economy,\" she noted.\nIt was also a question that the Financial Times polled in recent months, asking about voter perceptions of trust in the candidates on the economy. Harris was ahead at the time, but Donald Trump took the lead in the outlet's final poll.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how US policy and government affect your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "title": "10 predictions for the space economy in 2025",
        "date": "2024-11-23T15:00:52.000Z",
        "article_content": "2025 could prove to be one of the most transformative years on record for the space economy.\nBetween Elon Musk’s close ties with the incoming president, a new administration that is expected to be strongly pro-growth and anti-regulation, and the emergence of Starship, a rapidly reusable rocket that will shake up all the givens of accessing orbit, we are on the verge of significant changes that accelerate the growth of the space economy.\nThere are pros and cons to these upcoming changes. On the one hand, a more pro-growth administration will reduce and simplify the abundance of federal and local regulations that hamper new launch and development efforts and increase the costs for businesses. It could also lead to even more privatization of US space operations and greater federal funding support for space companies developing dual-use technologies. On the other hand, strong deregulation could prioritize growth over environmental protections. It could also pose challenges to the Earth observation sector and other climate monitoring technology.\nAnother key question is how much more dominant will SpaceX become in the next four years? The company is already the apex player in launch (the modern space economy wouldn’t even exist without the Falcon 9), so will its few competitors be innovative and strategic enough to keep up with the major growth that is coming?\nMusk’s close ties to the president-elect are only part of the equation here. The arrival of Starship will have a monumental impact on the space economy by accelerating growth in existing markets, enabling entirely new industries, and making existing infrastructure obsolete.\nAs we look ahead, here are 10 predictions for the space capital markets in 2025.\n1. The next four years\nUnder the new administration, expect an even greater focus on promoting the space economy and on commercial space integration into government programs. Given Musk’s role in the administration and as one of the largest donors of the campaign, SpaceX will be the greatest beneficiary, but others will benefit as well, most notably from a light-touch regulatory regime for novel space activities overseen by the Commerce.\n2. Starship comes online\nStarship will reach orbit and begin operational flights in the first half of 2025, carrying Starlink V2 satellites. With its rapidly accelerating test program reaching a nearly monthly launch cadence in 2024, Starship will double its flight rate in 2025, aided by less regulatory resistance from the FAA, which Musk will have influence over in his new role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\nThis vehicle will usher in the next phase of the space economy by significantly reducing the cost and complexity of payload missions; opening the door to crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, as well as lunar development; and setting the stage for emerging industries ranging from orbital habitats and manufacturing platforms to point-to-point travel and extended stay tourism in orbit and beyond.\n3. Mars or bust\nExpect an acceleration of plans for a crewed landing on Mars using primarily SpaceX/Starship architecture, unlike the more complicated NASA-led architecture for Artemis. Support for Artemis will likely continue but will be accompanied by a major review and reconsideration of architecture.\nFor example, a significant number of major programs, such as SLS, Orion, and ML2 are over budget, behind schedule, and/or otherwise troubled. However, any changes to SLS would likely cause domestic headaches, particularly at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., which supports 24,000 jobs and manages the SLS program. Additionally, the Gateway was designed to accommodate international collaboration in the Artemis program but with an America-first approach, and this approach could find less support.\n4. More competition for SpaceX despite a direct line to the White House\nAlthough SpaceX holds a dominant position in launch and satellite internet, 2025 will see competition emerge from several key players. Amazon’s (AMZN) Project Kuiper will begin operations next year, which poses the single greatest threat to Starlink’s market dominance. Direct-to-device connectivity will come online in 2025, with Starlink V2 and Apple (AAPL) moving to improve space-based communications for iPhones with a $1.7 billion investment in GlobalStar and AST SpaceMobile delivering for telecom partners like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ).\nStarlink will also see increased global competition from the Chinese G60/Thousand Sails constellation, which will see half of its first phase launched in 2025. New launch vehicles will also come online next year, including Rocket Lab’s (RKLB) Neutron and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. These will pose a direct challenge to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, although Starship is poised to move the goalposts and supersede them.\n5. Space Superiority\nGeopolitical strains continue to fuel an increase in US Defense spending, with benefits for the US Space Force (USSF), which will be accelerated under the new administration. We expect this to show up most clearly in Resilient Global Positioning Systems (R-GPS) and Alternative Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (AltPNT) as conflicts continue and China’s BeiDou continues to displace GPS in aligned countries.\nThrough Starshield, the USSF will increasingly rely on SpaceX for national security missions across GPS, geospatial intelligence, satellite communications (SatCom), space domain awareness, in-space transportation, and more. The establishment of a Space National Guard is inevitable under the new administration and will further expand public-commercial alliances and technology integrations.\n6. Incumbents adjust to the new world order\nIn 2025, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (AIR.PA) will sell off their space businesses after failing to keep up with the pace of change. These divestitures by entrenched government contractors mark a pivotal moment in the space economy, as it changes the competitive landscape, establishes a new power broker system, and creates new opportunities and risks in the government’s extended capabilities in space.\nMeanwhile, expect an acceleration in SatCom M&A as leading incumbents — such as SES (SES) and Intelsat (combined in 2024), DirectTV and Dish (2024), Viasat and Inmarsat (2023), Eutelsat and OneWeb (2023) — push for greater consolidation to better compete with Starlink and other new non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) entrants.\n7. Connecting the digital and physical worlds\nOver the next year, artificial intelligence will continue to transform capabilities across the space economy, but it will be most prevalent in “spatial intelligence” as it facilitates the integration of geospatial data into Big Tech.\nThe successful integration of Mapbox with OpenAI’s ChatGPT search is just one early example of the possibilities evolving in this marketplace. World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, has raised $230 million to develop spatially intelligent large world models (LWMs) that can understand and reason about the 3D world from images and other modalities.\nCompanies are already in a race to automate systems that enable proliferated architecture, and AI is the only real solution to the bottleneck. Expect these efforts to accelerate dramatically in 2025, particularly due to stronger federal support for Big Tech and AI innovation as the next administration looks to increase its lead over China.\n8. Coordination of orbital traffic goes from elective to essential\nWhile China has launched a lot of rockets to date, it still only comprises a small percentage of the total global mass to orbit. Expect that to change in 2025 as Chinese mega-constellations like G60, Geely, and more begin to launch in earnest. The exponential growth in satellites in orbit (currently faster than Moore’s Law) will force the conversation of coordination despite geopolitical tensions.\nDue to the US government’s restrictions on direct collaboration with China, these efforts will be led by private industry. This will create a new wave of privatization in space traffic coordination and there is a strong probability that the Commerce Department’s Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS) program will either be canceled or significantly restructured to emphasize commercial data.\n9. Political climate\nUnder the next administration, the US is about to make a sharp turn on climate policy, which will have negative impacts on certain environmental protections and new efforts by geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) companies to improve climate monitoring and solutions.\nThe biggest risks for the GEOINT industry are a reduction in federal funding and specific programs, like NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and NOAA’s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) programs, as well as an overall challenge (and perhaps dismantling) of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incentives for businesses and investors.\nAt the same time, extreme weather events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires will become increasingly frequent, impacting more people and further straining insurance markets. Private capital will have to step up to continue to fund energy transition and climate projects, like MethaneSAT and FireSAT, in an effort to fill the gap left by cuts in climate change and civil Earth observation programs by the new administration.\n10. Play stations\nWhoever buys Boeing’s International Space Station (ISS) operations business will continue their push for an extension of the ISS beyond 2030. Meanwhile, Vast will launch its Haven station in 2025, providing an exit option for a government program that is underfunded and unwanted. The current administration has already been rethinking its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program (CLD), and that skepticism is likely to intensify in the next administration.\nThe reality is that space stations are extremely costly and difficult to maintain, and Starship provides an effective alternative that checks a number of key boxes: It's less expensive, easier and faster to launch and become operational, and you can have multiple stations for less than the cost of one ISS today. Between the practicality of Starship and Musk’s influence in the White House, there is a strong possibility that space stations will become another SpaceX domain.\nWhile the last decade has seen remarkable progress in the space economy, the next four years will experience many dramatic changes — beginning with a rapid phaseout of incumbents and new political priorities in 2025.\nThe space economy is poised for a surge in growth and development that will be fueled by deregulation and enhanced US defense spending, but the disruptive effects of Starship, as well as SpaceX’s growing influence over federal policy, will have far-reaching impacts across many space industries.\nChad Anderson is the founder and managing partner of Space Capital, where he has been pioneering investment in the space economy for over a decade. He is an investor in SpaceX, along with dozens of other space companies, and is also the author of \"The Space Economy,\" published by Wiley. Between 2019 and 2022, Anderson regularly briefed the White House on startup activity and investment trends in the space economy. That intelligence has been cited by the vice president of the United States at the National Space Council and the Secretary of Commerce.

        "article_content": "The global economy is on track for a decade of “wasted opportunity” and “broken promises”, the World Bank has warned.\nGrowth in the first half of the 2020s is on course to be the weakest in decades, the Washington-based organisation said.\nEconomic performance is on track to be even worse than the aftermath of the financial crisis and other downturns since the early 1990s.\nThe bleak record comes despite hopes the 2020s would prove a transformative period for development and living standards after a “lost” decade in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\nIn its latest Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank said: “The 2020s have so far been a period of broken promises.\n“Governments across the world have fallen short of the ‘unprecedented’ goals they promised to meet by 2030: to end poverty and hunger everywhere; to combat inequalities within and among countries; and to ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources.”\nThe World Bank, which is owned by 187 countries and aims to boost international development, predicted that global GDP growth will fall to 2.4pc this year, down from 2.6pc last year.\nIt will mark the third year of slowing growth in a row and means economic expansion remains far below the average of 3.1pc seen during the 2010s.\nApart from the first year of the pandemic, 2024 is poised to have the slowest growth rate since the financial crisis, World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill said.\nMost of the drag is coming from the world’s poorest countries, where growth is anaemic.\nMr Gill said: “The post-Covid global economy has been a very uneven one, in the sense that it has been better for richer countries.”\nAs a result many people in the world’s poorest countries will still be worse off at the end of 2024 than they were at the onset of the pandemic, he added.\nMeanwhile, investment is set to grow at half the pace of the previous two decades – suggesting growth will continue to underwhelm for the remainder of the 2020s.\nThe World Bank predicted that inflation globally will fall to 3.7pc in 2024, down from 5.3pc last year. However, it warned that rising wages would keep inflation above the 2pc target used by most major investment banks.\nDeputy chief economist Ayhan Kose said: “Significant progress has been made in lowering inflation around the world. We should celebrate that.\n“However, I suggest we do not pop the champagne yet. Inflation is projected to remain above target in most advanced economies and developing economies well into 2024.”\nMr Kose warned that high interest rates would be a feature “for the foreseeable future” until central banks feel fully confident that they can deliver sustained low inflation.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
