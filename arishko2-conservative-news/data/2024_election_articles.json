        "article_content": "When either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris takes power in 2025, they will have a significant effect on your financial life for years to come.\nAre you most focused on your finances in retirement? Best to look at what each side might do when it comes to things like Social Security and drug costs.\nFor live election updates, check out the Yahoo News live blog >\nMore concerned about the price of everyday goods? How the new administration approaches an array of issues, from the Federal Reserve to tariffs to Ukraine, will have an impact there.\nAnd don't forget taxes. A range of Trump-era tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025, and the shape of any deal to avert what would be an effective tax hike for millions of Americans will be defined by who occupies the Oval Office next year.\nTo help sort through the furious election season, Yahoo Finance analyzed the positions of the two nominees on 20 of the top financial issues up for debate. These are the ones that matter most for American wallets.\nBoth candidates now have pages dedicated to their stances on the issues but they often gloss over key financial details. What you will find as you explore our interactive guide below is that the two parties are promising vastly different approaches to consequential policies that impact nearly every aspect of your economic future.\nYahoo Finance compiled this guide based on what the candidates have said on the campaign trail as well as through conversations with campaign officials and outside experts.\nThe guide doesn't address a range of other important topics that are central in voter's minds — notably issues like abortion and the Middle East — only because they have less direct financial consequences.\nPolitical unrest is also a top concern for voters, with Democrats often highlighting what they see as Donald Trump's threat to democracy and Trump himself surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13.\nThe race was upended in July when President Joe Biden stepped aside from his reelection bid after a politically calamitous debate performance. Vice President Kamala Harris quickly stepped in to replace him and proceeded to secure the Democratic nomination within days.\nHarris holds broadly similar positions to Biden but has been gradually sketching out details of her own economic agenda, including the release of a plan in August focused on the cost of living followed by another in early September focused on small business and a third plan later in the month for manufacturers.\nThe information in this interactive guide was last updated on November 1 and will be updated again if more details of either candidates' positions emerge.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "title": "3 surprises that could upend the 2024 election",
        "date": "2024-06-18T21:35:41.000Z",
        "article_content": "As everybody knows, the 2024 election features two geriatric candidates and unprecedented concerns about the physical and mental fitness of the nation’s next president. Few Americans would be surprised if Donald Trump or Joe Biden, or both of them, dropped out of the race for health reasons.\nOther factors that fewer people are thinking about could upend the race too, and change the outlook for investors trying to gauge whether Democrat Joe Biden or Republican Donald Trump would be better for markets and the economy. Here are three of them:\nThis is always a risk, but security officials are now signaling unusually high levels of concern that a plot could be afoot. There’s particular focus on the southwest border, where terrorists may try to infiltrate the country amid the surge of migrants that have been showing up and trying to get in.\nIn April testimony before a House committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that during the last year, “We’ve seen the threat from foreign terrorists rise to a whole other level.” That happened, he said, after Hamas attacked Israel last fall and Israel retaliated with an all-out war, suggesting militants may be seeking to punish the United States for supporting Israel. “I’d be hard-pressed to think of a time where so many threats to our public safety and national security were so elevated all at once,” Wray warned.\nIn mid-June, eight people from Tajikistan who are reportedly affiliated with the Islamic State terrorist group were arrested in New York, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. The Associated Press reported that they entered the country through the southwest border. On June 16, Rep Mike Turner (R-Ohio) said the United States was at “its highest level of a possible terrorist threat.” In a recent Foreign Affairs article, Graham Allison and Michael Morell pointed out that these were the same sorts of warnings public officials were making before the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.\nA bloody terrorist attack is one of the few things that could change the arc of the election overnight. If it looked as if government negligence allowed terrorists to sneak in, it could doom President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. It could also have the opposite effect, with voters rallying behind Biden as they did with President George W. Bush in 2001.\nFinancial markets typically shake off terrorist attacks, but an attack tied to Islamic jihadists could easily trigger the wider Middle East war many analysts are worried about. That would disrupt a record run for the US stock market and the gradual return of inflation to normal levels. The 2024 election would morph from a referendum on the Biden economy to a question of which candidate has a better chance of extinguishing a world on fire.\nTrump’s May 31 conviction on 34 counts of business fraud didn’t seem to change his standing in the polls by much. But that could change when a judge determines his sentence on July 11. “If Trump gets a sentence of prison, maybe that gives somebody who’s unsure the real pause,” political analyst Kristen Soltis Anderson said on a recent videocast with pollster Bruce Mehlman. “Is America staring down the prospect of putting a man in the White House who is also headed to jail? That might be a tougher pill to swallow for swing voters.”\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nThe judge’s punishment options range from nothing at all to several years behind bars. A middle ground might be home detention, with Trump wearing an ankle bracelet so authorities will know if he goes somewhere he shouldn’t. That would create the surreal spectacle of Republicans nominating Trump as their presidential nominee at the GOP convention in Milwaukee on July 18, even though Trump’s criminal sentence prevents him from attending in person. Republican officials are reportedly making contingency plans for Trump to accept the nomination remotely, like a Zoom meeting attendee.\nTelevised debates can be decisive in close presidential elections since they’re the only time many voters will hear directly from each of the candidates. Strong debate performances and memorable lines helped John Kennedy win the White House as a challenger in 1960 and Ronald Reagan do the same in 1980. When Mitt Romney challenged incumbent Barack Obama in 2012, he jumped in the polls after a robust debate performance in early October. Obama came out swinging in the last and final debate, regaining lost ground.\nTrump and Biden are scheduled for two debates, one on June 27 and another on Sept. 10. It goes without saying that if either candidate suffers an embarrassing senior moment before millions of primetime viewers, it could be curtains for his campaign. It could also go the other way, with, say, Biden scoring some clever and entertaining zingers, or Trump putting aside his familiar list of personal grievances and offering some fresh ideas for solving important problems. And once the second debate is over, all the two candidates will have to do is survive until Election Day on Nov. 5.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "American voters have chosen Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, handing him a commanding victory against Vice President Kamala Harris.\nA call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the Associated Press on Wednesday morning put him over the top, with Trump now set to have the distinction of being the 45th and the 47th US president.\n\"This was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,\" he told supporters early Wednesday morning as he neared victory. \"And now it's going to reach a new level of importance.\"\nThe former president was powered by strong support among men and an intense voter focus on inflation that has been evident in nearly every poll in the years since consumer inflation peaked at a 9.1% annual rate in June 2022.\n\"America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,\" Trump also said on Wednesday, noting his win in the electoral college and his lead, as of Wednesday morning, in the popular vote.\nInflation has moderated in recent years, but it has nonetheless remained front and center in voters' minds, which Trump proved able to use to win Joe Biden voters back to his side and bring new voters who sat out previous contests to the polls.\n“We are going to turn our country around,” he promised voters in his final rally late Monday night in Grand Rapids, Michigan. “I will end inflation very quickly.”\nIt was a refrain he repeated at nearly every campaign stop, including on Wednesday morning, where his podium read, \"Trump will fix it.\"\nTrump's main campaign promises — a new wave of tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants — could put new upward pressure on prices, many economists say.\nA note from Capital Economics late Tuesday night crystallized some of the macroeconomic worries. The authors wrote that they expected Trump to push forward on his proposed immigration curbs and tariffs and, as a result, “we are minded to reduce our GDP growth forecast ... by roughly 1% and add 1% to our inflation forecast over the same period.”\nRead more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?\nTrump has remained undeterred on the campaign trail, pledging to impose new blanket tariffs on Mexico during a stop in North Carolina on the final day of campaigning.\n\"You're the first ones I've told it to,\" Trump told a crowd in Raleigh. \"Congratulations, North Carolina.\"\nTrump has also promised things like 60% tariffs on China and 20% tariffs on America's other trading partners in addition to his promises of duties on Mexico.\nAn analysis from Goldman Sachs projected that a Trump win would negatively impact US GDP growth by 50 basis points, in large part because of a \"hit to growth from tariffs.\"\nWhile economists may be skeptical, voters clearly weren’t in the aggregate, as Trump carried the Tar Heel State by a healthy margin and found new levels of support above his previous runs for the presidency in 2016 and 2020.\nTrump will also immediately be at the center of a fierce tax debate set to consume Washington in 2025 over whether to extend tax cuts that Trump himself signed into law in 2017.\nWhat Trump has promised is a complete extension of the cuts for individuals of all income levels, alongside a dizzying array of additional promises from no taxes on tips and overtime to lowering taxes for big business.\nAll told, a complete Trump tax agenda comes with a price tag in the neighborhood of $9 trillion over the coming decade, according to the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). And he has laid out a few concrete ways to pay for it all.\nBut how far he will be able to go there is largely dependent on Congress, where Republicans have taken control of the Senate but control of the US House is still unclear.\nTrump is also set to have a guiding hand on a wide range of issues from the selection of the next Federal Reserve Chairman (perhaps the only certainty there is that Jerome Powell will not be nominated to a third term) to energy (where Trump may attempt to roll back green energy subsidies).\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how US policy and government affect your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "title": "These 4 economic variables could 'easily flip' the 2024 election for Biden or Trump: Moody’s",
        "date": "2024-02-04T14:01:20.000Z",
        "article_content": "In a new analysis, three economists at Moody’s Analytics took a deep dive on the coming election season. Their conclusion: President Joe Biden has a slight advantage at the moment both on the economy and on his overall chances of being reelected.\nBut it’s a tenuous edge at best.\n\"The election could easily flip with only small shifts in the economy’s performance,\" write the authors, Mark Zandi, Brendan LaCerda, and Justin Begley. There are, they add, four economic indicators that election watchers should perhaps bookmark in the months ahead.\nThe report details a series of economic tests that Biden’s reelection effort will face in the coming nine months. Whether the current president wins, or former President Donald Trump prevails, the result could hinge on which direction the needle moves on things like gas prices, mortgage rates, real household income, and the overall metric of consumer confidence.\nAny of those factors could flip the election results, but the price of fuel is at the top of the list with its outsized impact on voter perceptions. \"All else equal, if gas prices surge back close to $4 per gallon, Trump will win,\" they write.\nThe challenge for Biden is that he has limited options to push the needle one way or another.\n\"Given the cross-currents in global oil demand and supply, it is very difficult to gauge the outlook for gas prices, and such an increase in prices cannot be ruled out,\" the economists note, but they currently project that prices will sit at around $3.50 a gallon on election day.\nIn 2022 during the early stages of the war in Ukraine, the Biden administration confronted gas prices directly with historic releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). That option is unlikely to be on the table again with the reserve hovering near lows not seen since the early 1980s — and any move on the SPR in 2024 is sure to be attacked as a political ploy.\nOther key factors isolated by the authors include mortgage rates and real household incomes.\nThe authors find that a surge of mortgage rates to more than 8.5% would \"crush housing affordability\" and could undo Biden’s chances.\nOn this front, the White House again has little it can do directly on mortgage rates. Yet campaign aides at the president's headquarters in Delaware will surely be closely watching the Federal Reserve as a lowering of the central bank's benchmark interest rate could move through the economy and help out homeowners. Earlier this week, the Fed maintained its current interest rate level with Chair Jerome Powell offering pushback on market expectations of a cut as early as March.\nAll told, the central bank has five more meetings between now and Election Day 2024.\nAnother key factor highlighted in this week’s report is real household income, the measure of how wage levels are measuring up against inflation.\nAmericans' purchasing power has made strides in recent months as inflation has declined; continued improvement on that front could be a tailwind for Biden. This week's report finds that that metric would need to \"suffer a significant decline\" to markedly lower Biden’s chances. The trio of economists also note that such a plummet would also be consistent with the economy entering a recession.\nThe authors also highlight consumer confidence — which has been surging as of late — is another key factor to watch. And one likely be shaped by the three factors above.\nThe report also highlighted a variety of other things that could tip the balance — from turnout to how much interest third-party candidates receive.\nThe power of third-party candidates — from Robert Kennedy to Cornel West — is yet to be determined as they try to claim a spot on state ballots this November.\nThe report notes that if the third-party support ends up at 1.8% — as it was in 2020 — that’s good news for Biden. But \"simply increasing the national third-party vote share by one standard deviation to 7.5%, flips the election in favor of Trump, all else equal.\"\nThe overall takeaway from the report — the first of a series of monthly updates that Moody’s has planned between now and Election Day — is for a hotly contested election that is far from a sure thing for either side.\nBiden’s team got some good news polling this week with a Quinnipiac University poll that shows the current president ahead by 6 percentage points nationwide. But state polls of battlegrounds, which is where the election will actually be decided, offer better news for Trump including a recent Bloomberg poll that found the former president ahead in seven swing states.\nThe Moody’s report was a little more bullish on Biden's chances in those bellwether states and says that Pennsylvania is the key state to watch with its 19 electoral votes. The focus on the keystone state comes as Biden is perhaps on track to pick up North Carolina with that state's demographics in flux, but at risk of losing Arizona as the immigration surge weighs especially heavy on voter perceptions there.\nThe only thing you can probably count on for sure, the report concludes, is that the election will be close.\nThe authors say Biden has an opportunity to ride good economic news to a second term \"but these are big assumptions in a highly uncertain economic time and given our highly fractured and contentious politics.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Buckle up.\nThat’s the message from Wall Street pros as investors brace for a close 2024 presidential election.\nSo far this year, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has rallied 21%, making 2024 the best election year through October since 1936. But that outperformance could be at risk, at least in the immediate term, as the too-close-to-call race is largely expected to trigger market volatility.\nPredictions market Polymarket currently shows a 62.3% chance that Donald Trump will win the election, and that has prompted a return of the so-called Trump trade. Treasurys dropped and gold soared once again last week as investors bet that Trump’s proposed policies surrounding tariffs and tax cuts could prove to be inflationary.\n“The key for markets will be certainty in the outcome from which to understand economic impacts and evaluate implications for the trend of economic growth and evaluation of sector winners and losers,” Rob Haworth, US Bank Wealth Management senior investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance.\nGiven the key themes that have emerged from Trump's and Harris’s respective campaigns, I asked a number of strategists what a Republican versus Democratic presidency means for business and Wall Street and narrowed that list down to three trade ideas under each scenario.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nFinancials is viewed as a top trade under a Republican presidency on the expectations for looser regulation and increased M&A activity.\nAccording to a recent note from Fitch Ratings, a July 2021 executive order under the Biden-Harris administration encouraging greater scrutiny of mergers has impeded deal activity — guidance that is expected to change under Trump.\n“While no proposed mergers have been formally denied since the directive took effect, approval times have increased markedly and, in some cases, to the point of making deals non-viable, as market conditions turned during the review period,” Christopher Wolfe, head of North American banks for Fitch Ratings, wrote in a note.\nUBS Global Wealth Management ElectionWatch co-lead Kurt Reiman told me financials stand out as a “key beneficiary” in both a red sweep scenario (meaning Republicans control the White House, Senate, and House) and a Trump presidency with a split Congress.\nReiman said a looser regulatory environment could lead to lower costs and greater ability to return capital to shareholders, as well as a higher likelihood that consolidation in the financial services industry would face less resistance.\nOn the flip side, Reiman and his team see Democrats controlling the White House, Senate, and House as a “worst-case scenario” for financial services due in part to the probability of greater support for the Credit Card Competition Act — a bill he views as ushering in new regulations and stricter interpretations of current rules.\nBank of America’s Jason Kupferberg echoed a similar sentiment. In a recent note to clients, Kupferberg and his team wrote that a Democratic sweep would be a “worst case scenario” for the payments sector for two reasons: higher probability of a tougher stance on the DOJ’s lawsuit versus Visa (V) and the potential for new laws to lessen Visa's and Mastercard's (MA) competitive edge in the US.\nThe expectation of higher spending under a second Trump administration has sent gold (GC=F) prices to record highs. The precious metal closed the week at $2,734.44 an ounce, bringing its year-to-date gains to 34%.\nAnd the run may be far from over, according to Wealth Alliance president Eric Diton.\n“We just don't have a plan as a country to deal with our $35 trillion in debt and growing. … I haven't heard any talk about any kind of reduction in spending from either candidate,” Diton told Yahoo Finance.\nWhile neither candidate seems to have a plan to address the country's ballooning deficit, a recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Trump’s policies could add $7.5 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, compared to $3.5 trillion under Harris.\nManaged-care insurers could see some relief under a second Trump administration due to the likelihood of greater support for privatized programs like Medicare Advantage — an approach long preferred by Republicans.\nAnd that could give a boost to companies like Humana (HUM), UnitedHealth (UNH), and CVS (CVS).\nOppenheimer’s Michael Wiederhorn named Humana as the firm’s \"best idea\" for a Republican sweep, noting that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries account for 87% of the company’s premium revenue.\n“The key ways that a Republican regime could support Mastercard include strong rate increases and a favorable regulatory environment,” Wiederhorn noted.\nIt’s a pivotal election for the electric vehicle industry, and not just because of Trump’s close ties with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Rather, the former president’s promise to roll back the Biden administration’s EV policies on \"day one\" could have significant implications.\n“This week’s election, and the potential shift in government regulations based on who wins, will be more consequential to the automotive industry than any previous election,” iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer said in a statement.\nEarlier this year, RBC’s Tom Narayan told me Trump’s “erratic” behavior during his first term left the auto industry uneasy, and they view his past threats as a potential challenge to their business if he were to be elected.\nOn the other hand, Harris has been supportive of the current administration’s efforts to expand access to EVs. She is largely expected to extend the Biden-era $7,500 tax incentive for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs — a credit that Guggenheim’s Ron Jewsikow has told me is a “key affordability enabler.”\nWedbush’s Dan Ives sees a Harris ticket as a positive for General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Stellantis (STLA), and the EV industry more broadly, including Tesla.\nHarris’s promise to support the housing market and make home affordability a centerpiece of her economic agenda is a bullish sign for homebuilders, according to Oppenheimer.\nThe team, led by analyst Tyler Batory, sees Harris’s plan to build 3 million new housing units and improve housing affordability as a key catalyst for the sector. The team named D.R. Horton (DHI) as a top housing play, making the case that the stock is “uniquely positioned” given its focus on entry-level housing.\n“The company’s lower ASP (pricing) should benefit from increased demand from a tax credit, and its scale would allow further ramping of home production,” Batory wrote.\nIn the company’s third quarter earnings call, D.R. Horton CEO Paul Romanowski warned affordability and election uncertainty had prompted “some buyers to stay on the sidelines in the near-term,\" sending ripples across the industry. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF declined 1.6% for the week, bringing its one-month loss to -8%.\nMore social support under a Harris administration will boost off-price retailers, according to Evercore’s Michael Binetti.\n“A blue sweep would likely benefit the lowest income consumers and within our space, Burlington Stores has the lowest income demographics and a bigger margin opportunity than Ross Stores,” Binetti wrote.\nOff-price retailers have outperformed this year as consumers hunt for value amid sticky inflation. Burlington Stores (BURL) posted better-than-expected earnings and raised its outlook during its most recent quarterly report, while Ross Stores’ (ROST) value offerings helped boost sales by 7%. Shares of Burlington have soared 100% over the past year, while Ross has jumped 21%.\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on Twitter @SeanaNSmith.

        "article_content": "The 2024 presidential election is weeks away, and healthcare is expected to be a key issue for voters as they head to the ballot box.\nThe overall cost of healthcare remains a major problem. Healthcare expenditures grew 4.1% in 2022, reaching $4.5 trillion and accounting for 17.3% of US GDP.\nThe ballooning costs highlight the crux of the US healthcare conundrum: The US spends more on healthcare than any other developed country in the world — an estimated $13,493 per person. Yet it falls behind in overall healthcare performance, access and affordability, administrative efficiency, equity, and health outcomes, according to the Commonwealth Fund.\n“The cost of healthcare is always a pocketbook concern for Americans,” Paul Shafer, assistant professor at Boston University's Department of Health Law, Policy, and Management, told Yahoo Finance.\nIn recent weeks, the campaigns of both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have elevated healthcare issues. While Trump's proposals have been light on details, he has focused on healthcare costs by pledging to tackle insurance premiums, improve price transparency, and reduce surprise bills.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nHarris, meanwhile, has promised to extend the enhanced subsidies in the Affordable Care Act marketplace, cap insulin costs for all Americans — not just Medicare recipients — cancel medical debt, and expand Medicare to cover long-term care.\nHere's a rundown of some of the healthcare issues facing Americans, which make them relevant to the presidential race, and each campaign's stances when relevant.\nAn estimated 20 million Americans collectively owe $220 billion in medical debt, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker.\nIn June, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that it would erase medical debt from credit reports using funding from the American Rescue Plan.\nHarris has said in her economic plan that her administration would “work with states to help them enter into agreements with hospitals and other health providers to relieve medical debt for more Americans, and help create plans to prevent debt accumulation in the future.”\nTrump has not laid out a plan for tackling the issue.\nKFF found that among insured adults with medical debt, 35% indicated they did not fill a prescription for medicine due to cost within the last 12 months (compared to 7% of insured adults without medical debt), while 41% didn’t go to a doctor or clinic for a medical problem due to cost (compared with 9% without medical debt).\nWendell Potter, former Cigna executive and current president of the Center for Health and Democracy, noted that high out-of-pocket costs and other barriers make it difficult for people to get the care they need — even if they have insurance.\n“It’s one thing, and laudable, to have 91%-92% of Americans covered,\" Potter said. \"You still have millions who don’t have coverage, but the vast majority of people who have medical debt have insurance.”\nIn 2024, the average annual premium was $1,368 for single coverage and $6,296 for family coverage.\nFor workers with single coverage in a plan with an annual deductible — the amount of money a consumer pays for covered healthcare services before insurance kicks in — the average annual deductible is $1,787. Family deductibles, meanwhile, range from $1,548 to $4,991, depending on the plan structure.\nWhile in office, Trump signed an executive order that required hospitals to disclose prices in a consumer-friendly format and insurers to show people what they can expect to pay for out-of-pocket non-emergency services through an online tool.\nIn addition to high out-of-pocket costs, other insurance practices — such as prior authorization, which requires provider approval for certain prescriptions or services — can increase costs.\nAn August 2024 survey from the Commonwealth Fund found that 55% of respondents between the ages of 19 and 64 reported not challenging a bill for a service that they thought should have been free or covered by their health insurance.\nAccording to Potter, it’s “baked into the system to take a long time” because insurers know that consumers will often give up or their physicians have so many other prior authorizations that they won’t focus on any one patient.\n“It’s gotten more difficult for physicians to practice and treat their patients ... because of the interference in various ways by insurance companies,” he said.\nTrump has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, and replace it with something else. However, during his previous term in office, he and Republicans spearheaded multiple failed attempts to do so.\nHarris, meanwhile, has pledged to permanently expand the enhanced subsidies granted through the ACA, which the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services stated have saved most consumers at least $800 annually on premiums.\nGideon Lukens, senior fellow and director of research for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told Yahoo Finance that a surge in marketplace enrollment since 2020 is likely due to these \"affordability improvements.\"\nLukens said policymakers \"need to be aware\" that extending these tax credits is something that \"needs to happen as soon as possible\" to prevent premium spikes.\n“I think the urgency for extending the enhanced premium tax credits is something that not everybody is aware of,” he said.\nMedicaid expansion has been an ongoing issue since the implementation of the ACA.\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court ruled to leave decisions up to states on whether to adopt the ACA's expansion, creating a \"coverage gap\" in the 10 states that still haven't expanded Medicaid. That translates to roughly 2 million individuals without healthcare coverage.\nA 2023 study published in Health Affairs found that states that adopted the Medicaid expansion were able to reduce uninsured rates and narrow racial and ethnic disparities in coverage.\nThe current uninsured rate on a national level is 8.2%, or roughly 27.1 million people, as of Q1 '24. When broken down by racial/ethnic group, the uninsured rates vary widely: 26% of Hispanic/Latino Americans, 9.8% of Black Americans, 7.7% of white Americans, and 5.1% of Asian Americans.\n\"Not only have coverage gains from the enhanced premium tax credits increased coverage overall, but they’ve also reduced disparities and inequities,\" Lukens said.\nAnother issue that Shafer, the Boston University professor, said is “top of mind” for many voters is reproductive health.\n“Vice President Harris wants to restore Roe through legislation, while former President Trump failed to commit to vetoing a national abortion ban in their first decade,” he said.\nHarris is a staunch supporter of abortion rights, particularly after the Roe v. Wade decision was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022. Her campaign website states that as president, \"she will never allow a national abortion ban to become law. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom nationwide, she will sign it.\"\nDuring his term as president, the Trump administration made several moves to limit access to abortion, including cutting federal funding from health centers that refer patients for abortions. Trump also appointed three Supreme Court justices who all voted in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade, a decision that he celebrated and even takes credit for.\nAs a candidate this time around, Trump has attempted to strike a different tone on abortion. When a Florida ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy took effect earlier in 2024, Trump criticized the law — but also opposed a state ballot measure to codify abortion rights in the state. He has been vocal about his support for IVF, even as members of his own party seek to limit access.\nEarlier this year, he posted a video on his Truth Social platform stating, \"My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state. At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people. You must follow your heart or in many cases, your religion or your faith. Do what's right for your family and do what's right for yourself.\"\n—\nAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and healthcare policy for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "WASHINGTON, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jim Rickards, the renowned former advisor to the CIA, Pentagon, and White House who successfully predicted the 2008 financial crisis, Trump’s 2016 election victory, and the COVID pandemic, has issued a new dire warning about the upcoming 2024 Presidential Election. Rickards predicts an unprecedented level of chaos, warning that the election could trigger a 50% market crash, the collapse of the U.S. dollar, violent street riots, and even the suspension of fundamental rights under martial law.\n\nRickards, who has been a trusted advisor to international finance and military institutions for over four decades, believes that America is on the brink of an economic and social meltdown due to the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 election. According to Rickards, recent developments—including President Biden stepping out of the race and the Democrats' strategic efforts to support Kamala Harris—indicate that the establishment may not allow Donald Trump to regain power, even if he wins the election.\nRickards explained, \"I predict this coming election meltdown will shake America to its core, resulting in a market crash, a dollar collapse, and possibly widespread violence and unrest. This is the most serious threat to our nation that I've seen in my career.\"\nRickards has outlined five critical steps that Americans should take immediately to safeguard their assets and prepare for what he describes as the \"most dangerous crisis in our nation’s history.\"\nThis special advisory, based on years of experience and insights gained from high-level government roles, offers detailed recommendations to help Americans protect their wealth and families. In particular, Rickards is providing free access to several bonus reports for those who subscribe to his research.\nJim Rickards is now calling on all Americans to prepare, emphasizing that ignoring the signs could lead to devastating losses, both financially and personally. \"The stakes are higher than ever. I urge all Americans to be proactive in securing their futures before it’s too late,\" says Rickards.\nTo access Jim Rickards’ latest insights and receive the tools needed to prepare for the coming crisis, visit Paradigm Press.\nAbout Jim RickardsJim Rickards is a lawyer, economist, and renowned advisor to the U.S. intelligence community and Wall Street.

        "article_content": "The 2024 presidential race is well underway and is slated to be one of the most razor-thin presidential elections in U.S. history.\nAs of Sept. 26, 2024, The New York Times’ election 2024 poll tracker indicated a national polling average of 49% for Vice President Kamala Harris and 46% for former President Donald Trump.

They’re an understated way to show your political support for the Democratic candidate without verbal political discourse.\nMany neighbors have their eyes on Buffett’s front yard to see whether he’ll display the famous blue-dot sign, signifying his support for Harris in the 2024 presidential race, or whether he’ll display a red-dot sign or something to signify his support for Trump.\nCheck Out: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for the Housing Market If Trump Wins the Election\nBuffett famously supported Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in previous election years, but it remains to be seen whether he’ll show his support for the democratic ticket this time around.\nNebraska has historically been a red state when it comes to the Electoral College. In fact, the state itself hasn’t backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964. However, the 2nd Congressional District has its own electoral vote separate from Nebraska’s electoral votes. The district tends to be more politically independent than the rest of the state, and its one critical electoral vote could potentially mean the difference between a Harris or Trump victory in November.\nSo Buffett’s support one way or the other could sway voters in the district and potentially affect the outcome of the presidential election.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "Warren Buffett has always captured people’s attention, not just because of his success as an investor but because of his cautious and thoughtful approach to almost everything. This time, however, he's surprising everyone with his take on the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nBuffett, often called the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" has been mostly neutral regarding politics for years. In past elections, he has supported Democrats, including Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, but he stayed out of the 2020 race and made it clear he wasn't endorsing anyone. Many people thought Buffett would once again sit on the sidelines for 2024. But it looks like he has finally decided to break his silence.\nDon't Miss:\n‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nHe has made it clear he's not endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump or any other candidate. In a time of deep political division, Buffett has decided that staying out of the game is his best move.\nHis company put a statement on Berkshire Hathaway's website, saying, “In light of the increased usage of social media, there have been numerous fraudulent claims regarding Mr. Buffett's endorsement of investment products as well as his endorsement and support of political candidates.” It continues, “Mr. Buffett does not currently and will not prospectively endorse investment products or endorse and support political candidates.”\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\nBuffett also spoke about his decision to CNBC, clarifying that he is worried about misinformation. He wants people to know that any claims about him backing a particular candidate are untrue. \"I'm worried about people impersonating me and that's why we put that on the Berkshire website. Nobody should believe anybody saying I'm telling them how to invest or how to vote,\" Buffett explained.\nThis might be a letdown for some of his neighbors in Omaha who were hoping to see a \"blue-dot\" sign in his front yard – a symbol of Democratic support in a neighborhood that's mostly Republican. Interestingly, while Buffett has chosen to stay quiet, his daughter seems to be taking a different approach, with two blue-dot signs already in her yard.\nIn the past, Buffett has spoken out when he thought it necessary. He publicly denounced Donald Trump in 2016, for instance, and demanded that Trump’s tax returns be made public and he even released his own. But Buffett seems to be keeping politics at arm’s length this year. He's focusing on what he knows best – business and investing.\nRead Next:\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $1,000\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "article_content": "Jerome Powell made it clear Wednesday that he is ready for the inevitable political blowback if the Federal Reserve does in fact cut rates at its September meeting, just seven weeks before Election Day.\nWhen asked at a press conference if the Fed could, in fact, remain apolitical in taking such an action, he said, \"I absolutely do.\"\n\"Anything that we do before, during, or after the election will be based on the data, the outlook, and the balance of risks, and not on anything else,\" he added.\nThe collision of Fed monetary policy and a red-hot election season is now officially in play after Powell signaled the Fed could cut rates at its next meeting on Sept. 17-18 as long as inflation continues to cool.\n\"We think the time is approaching,\" Powell said in response to a question from Yahoo Finance.\nWhen asked if there was a growing sense of confidence on the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee that a cut could be made in September, he added, \"Yes,\" as long as the data supported such an outcome.\nA September rate cut could cause the central bank to face political criticism from both sides of the aisle in Washington.\nLawmakers from both parties have signaled they would criticize the Fed if a decision made at the last meeting before Election Day didn't go their way.\nIf Powell and his colleagues choose to keep rates at a 23-year high, a growing chorus of Democratic critics calling for cuts may reach a crescendo.\nBut if policymakers do indeed cut, Republicans from Donald Trump on down will be sure to cast the move as caving to election year pressure.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg published earlier this month, the Republican nominee and former president again reiterated that central bank officials should not ease monetary policy before the November election.\n\"It’s something that they know they shouldn’t be doing,\" Trump said.\nPowell’s response to this mounting wave of political pressure has been to echo an independent, apolitical approach he has honed throughout 2024, emphasizing that the only criteria that he considers will be data on prices and jobs.\nHe came back to that theme on Wednesday, saying “this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed\" and \"we never use our tools to support or oppose a political party, a politician, or any political outcome.\"\nIn May he even offered a challenge to reporters: \"You can go back and read the transcripts,\" he said. \"See if anybody mentions, in any way, the pending election.\"\nWhat Yahoo Finance found after reviewing years of FOMC meeting transcripts was — as Powell promised — few overt mentions of coming elections and no debate on the political merits of any one candidate over another.\nBut political topics still came up repeatedly as Fed officials wrestled with decisions that affected the US economy.\nIn just one example, Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari took time in a January 2018 meeting to highlight these pressures as then-Chair Janet Yellen was set to depart and Powell was preparing to take his current seat at the head of the table.\n\"We work very hard, all of us, to be nonpolitical and nonpartisan, and yet we exist in a partisan, political world,\" Kashkari said in the transcript of that gathering. He praised Yellen, saying she had effectively \"navigated that tension.\"\nThroughout the seven meetings that Powell went on to chair in 2018, as one example, the term \"political\" was uttered 40 times, according to a search of the transcripts.\nIt came up as committee members discussed everything from then-President Trump's trade policy to developments in Europe to the economic effects of \"political tensions in the United States\" around that election year.\nThe publicly available transcripts cover Powell's tenure from 2012, when he became a Fed governor, to his first year as chair in 2018. Transcripts are released on a five-year delay, so recent meetings are not yet publicly available.\nThis year, there is just one Fed meeting left until voters go to the polls to select their next president.\nThe Fed's November gathering is scheduled to kick off on the morning of Nov. 6, just hours after the election voting sites close.\n\"The bottom line is, if we do our very best to do our part, and we stick to our part, that will benefit all Americans. If we get it right, the economy will be stronger,\" Powell said Wednesday as he defended the Fed's approach.\n\"We'll have price stability. People will find jobs, wages will rise in real terms, everyone will benefit. So that's what we believe and that's how we will always act.\"\nFormer St. Louis Fed president Jim Bullard downplayed the impact of a Fed cut on the November election.\nIn D.C., \"somebody is going to be mad at you all the time,\" but \"I would dispute the idea that anybody ever won an election based on 25 basis points at the September meeting,\" he told Yahoo Finance Thursday.\n\"The notion that this has some kind of big impact on the election is kind of hyperbole, I think.\"\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Just over two years ago, Sam Bankman-Fried was still wandering the halls of Capitol Hill, doling out campaign donations and convincing lawmakers to pass crypto legislation. Today, of course, he’s waiting out his appeal in a Brooklyn federal detention center with Diddy, but in a cruel twist of fate, his vision came true, two years too late: The U.S. finally had its crypto election.\nWhen Coinbase picked up the mantle from SBF and launched its “Stand with Crypto Alliance” in August 2023, I was skeptical, to say the least, of the existence of a single “crypto voter,” let alone the 50 million Americans that Coinbase cited as a potential bloc. And I would argue that Coinbase—and the rest of the companies and VCs that joined the entente, from the Winklevii to a16z crypto—largely agree. When their affiliated Super PACs spent tens of millions of dollars on ads in crucial battleground races, they avoided mentioning crypto altogether.\nAnd yet, crypto won, all the way to the top of the ticket. There have already been gallons of spilled ink on how the MAGA Silicon Valley contingent shepherded Trump to his second term, but crypto served as the vanguard for making tech’s rightward shift more politically palatable. Figures like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong have been in open battle with the Biden administration—and especially SEC chair Gary Gensler—for more than a year, after all.\nAfter referring to Bitcoin as a “scam” as recently as 2021, Trump embraced the crypto industry’s prodigious wallets, even if his own foray into memecoins hasn’t quite paid out. He spoke at a flagship crypto conference, visited a Bitcoin bar in New York, and pledged to commute the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, a sign of how deep down the rabbit hole he really went. We’ll see if he keeps his promises.\nDownticket, buoyed by enough campaign donations to make SBF blush, pro-crypto candidates won across both parties—261 in the House, according to Stand with Crypto, and 17 in the Senate. Several of the industry’s greatest foes, including Ohio senator and banking committee chair Sherrod Brown, lost, paving the way for blockchain legislation to have a chance of passing next session, or even during a lame-duck compromise.\nAnd then there’s the rise of electoral betting markets, with the crypto-powered Polymarket and Kalshi predicting a Trump victory nearly the whole way, even when polls divined a toss-up or Harris edge. As I told Allie yesterday, probabilities are not exactly a sound way to gauge accuracy, but prediction markets certainly enjoyed their mainstream ascendancy. “The global truth machine is here, powered by the people,” wrote 26-year-old founder and CEO Shayne Coplan on Twitter.\nSo what does it all mean? Crypto is nowhere close to an issue that Americans care about like immigration or inflation, yet it was an indisputable driving force—and winner—of the 2024 election. The industry will likely now have a hand in deciding the economic policy of the next four years, from the upending of nearly a century of securities regulation to the injection of stablecoins into the monetary system to choosing Gensler’s replacement. You probably still won’t pay for coffee with Dogecoin anytime soon, but crypto could reshape our infrastructure. Somewhere in Brooklyn, a monkey’s paw is unfurling for SBF.\nI’ll be writing Term Sheet for the next couple of weeks, and I promise it won’t all be about crypto!

Here's how some of the biggest names - and their employees - have approached this election.\nA growing list of billionaires have backed Kamala Harris or Donald Trump.

Another conservative super PAC, or political action committee, the Sentinel Action Fund, also reported receiving US$2.3 million from Musk.\nHowever, the employees of companies owned by Musk have contributed far more to the Harris campaign than to Trump's, according to Washington-based non-partisan and non-profit group OpenSecrets.\nThe founder of global private equity firm Blackstone Group has endorsed Trump in this election and said his support was a \"vote for change\".\nSchwarzman and his wife Christine have donated some US$39.7 million to the Republican Party this year, according to The Washington Post. He had distanced himself from Trump after the 2020 election but that stance has shifted, with Schwarzman telling Axios in May that he was concerned about the country's economic, immigration and foreign policies.\nBlackstone employees have also donated more to the Republicans than Democrats, the latest OpenSecrets data shows.\nBlackstone chief Stephen Schwarzman has endorsed Trump.

Editorial page staff had written an endorsement of Harris for US president but it was not published following a decision by Bezos, the newspaper said.\nAmazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos has not publicly endorsed either candidate.

        "article_content": "Three swing states, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, could potentially trend redder, while two swing states, Wisconsin and Nevada, could shift bluer\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of the presidential election in November, Realtor.com® released a new report today, which used proprietary data on geographic home shopping trends and county-level 2020 election results to try to predict how population shifts could reshape the political landscape. As we look towards this presidential election, not only do shifting opinions on key topics like home prices, and housing affordability for both homeowners and renters have the possibility to impact the outcome of the election, the movement of people from state to state could potentially  play a role in the 2024 presidential election.\n\"The influence of migration on election outcomes is a compelling topic of discussion, sparking interest in how shifting populations might reshape the political landscape, \" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com®. \"As more people move across state lines, their voting habits could have the potential to sway election outcomes, especially in crucial swing states, where even small changes in the electorate can tip the scales. This dynamic raises important questions about how migration trends could influence the future of American politics this year and beyond.\"\nThis analysis highlights migration-informed possibilities that may factor alongside voter preferences on key issues to influence the Presidential election in 2024. Because neither people nor opinions are fixed, the U.S. electoral map is constantly changing. In the report, if a state receives a higher traffic influx from shoppers predicted to be red than from shoppers predicted to be blue and has a higher retention rate of local home shoppers predicted to be red compared to those predicted to be blue, the state is anticipated to trend redder in the 2024 election. Conversely, if a state draws more influx traffic that is predicted to be blue than influx traffic that is predicted to be red and has a higher retention rate among local home shoppers who are predicted to be blue, the state is anticipated to become bluer in the 2024 election. (See full methodology for how a shopper's political affiliation is predicted).\nThe new report found the following possibilities for the 2024 Presidential election:\nFour blue states—Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine—could trend bluer\nSeven blue states—California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington— could trend redder\nThree red states—Alaska, Florida and Ohio— could shift bluer\nTwelve red states—Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming— could  trend redder\nThree swing states—Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina— could trend redder\nTwo swing states—Wisconsin and Nevada— could shift bluer\nTwo swing states–Michigan and Pennsylvania–have mixed population shifts that do not suggest a clear direction–red or blue–for the local electorate\nOut of State Migration Preferences\nWhen a state receives a higher influx of blue shoppers compared to red shoppers, it is a more appealing out-of-state destination for blue buyers, and vice versa. New Jersey, with the largest  difference of 1.4 percentage points between blue and red influx rates, attracts more blue shoppers, while Tennessee with a difference of 0.5 percentage points, is the most favored destination for out-of-state red buyers.\nFlorida (12.9%), Texas (5.8%) and North Carolina (5.1%) rank among the top destinations for blue home shoppers.\nFlorida (12.8%), Texas (5.8%) and North Carolina (5.3%) also rank among the top destinations for red home buyers. Interestingly, both blue and red out-of-state home shoppers showed great interest in homes in the South, probably driven by the relatively affordable housing markets and warmer climate.\nWhere do blue and red home shoppers remain?A desirable location for potential home buyers is not only defined by its ability to attract new migrants, but also by the willingness of current residents to stay. To estimate the retention rate for in-state blue and red home buyers for each state, the analysis calculates the proportion of in-state blue and red home buyers who choose to shop homes within their own state. New Mexico retains the most in-state blue shoppers when compared to the rate of red shoppers, and New York retains the most in-state red home shoppers.\nMethodology:To analyze the shifting interests and patterns of U.S. home shoppers, this research utilizes online home shopping traffic data from Realtor.com spanning January 2021 to September 2024. To further explore moving interests by political affiliation, we examine county-level results from the 2020 presidential election. We determine the likelihood of each online view being associated with a blue, red, or independent shopper based on the proportion of votes each party received in the 2020 presidential election.\nFor instance, if 60% of voters in a county were Democrats, we would estimate that 60% of online traffic from that county comes from blue shoppers. This approach simplifies the analysis by assuming that the political affiliations of online home shoppers mirror the voter distribution in their respective counties. However, we do not consider other factors such as income, age, or housing preferences that may also influence online home shopping behavior.\nAbout Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

        "article_content": "NEW YORK, Oct. 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Axis My America (AMA), a leading consumer intelligence company, has released its United States Presidential Election 2024 Prediction based on an extensive national survey. The report, covering about 9593 respondents across all 50 states & District of Columbia, projects that Republican candidate Donald Trump holds a slight edge with 49% Popular Vote and an estimated 291 (+15) electoral votes, compared to Democratic candidate Kamala Harris's 48% Popular vote and 247 (+15) electoral votes. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are the states with very close fight which could swing 15 electoral votes to either party. The survey utilized a comprehensive methodology, incorporating face-to-face interviews and direct panel interactions to capture genuine voter sentiment and analyze key issues shaping the election. The Prediction Model is notably a Harvard Business Case Study and has an accuracy rate of 92% in the last 12 years while calling 76 elections including 3 General elections.\n \nParty\nPopular Vote %\nElectoral Votes\nRepublican Party\n(Donald Trump) \n49 (+2)\n291  (+15) \n Democratic Party\n(Kamala Harris)\n48 (+2)\n247  (+15) \nIndependent / Others\n3\n-\nMichigan (15), Wisconsin (10) & Pennsylvania (19) are the states with very close fight, hence range of 15 Electoral Votes may swing either side.\n \nAccording to AMA's findings, the election landscape is shaped by economic concerns, with inflation and healthcare access emerging as top voter priorities. The survey shows a close race, reflecting a nation divided over key issues such as national security, immigration, and economic stability. Demographic analysis further reveals notable shifts: White and Hispanic voters are leaning towards the Republican Party, while African Americans largely favor the Democratic Party. Gender plays a distinct role, with men supporting Trump and women favoring Harris. Younger voters (18-34) show stronger support for the Democratic Party, while older voters (45+) lean Republican. With these divisions, the election outcome may come down to candidates' ability to address core issues that resonate with diverse voting groups.\nAMA's report emphasizes the critical role of swing states, particularly Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where close polling margins suggest a tight race. Other pivotal battlegrounds like Arizona, Georgia show narrow divides that could tip either way. In Michigan, a slight Democratic edge exists, driven by strong African American and Asian American support, while White American voters lean Republican. In contrast, Pennsylvania is experiencing shifts among Asian American and White voters towards the Republican Party, with employment and inflation cited as key concerns. Wisconsin reflects a blend of shifting loyalties, with Independents and some Democratic voters moving towards the GOP, underscoring the fluidity and intensity of competition in swing states. Interestingly, battleground beyond the traditional swing states is also evolving. Shifting voter priorities and narrowing margins are expanding the traditional swing-state battleground to new states.\nAbout Axis My America\nAxis My America draws from over two decades of expertise in public opinion analytics.

        "article_content": "Trading desks at major banks are expecting a flurry of activity when the chaotic 2024 election comes to a close, and that could cement what is already a banner year for Wall Street.\nTrading volume tends to go up immediately after a presidential election ends, according to Bank of America head of markets Jim DeMare, starting on the day after the event.\nThis year, he told Yahoo Finance, \"I would anticipate that … the day after mirrors those previous years.\"\nIf that happens, traders could add to what is already a record haul. Through the first three quarters of 2024, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), and Citigroup (C) posted roughly $89 billion in combined fixed income and equity trading revenue.\nNot only is that up 5.5% from 2023, it is also the highest trading amount for that nine-month period ever recorded by the five largest Wall Street banks. The trading of equities is driving much of this performance.\n\"We would expect people to want to put some risk on post-election,\" Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup’s head of equity trading strategy, told Yahoo Finance.\n\"With the caveat that the election is resolved in a straightforward way, then the US equity market looks set up well into year-end,\" Kaiser added.\nThe reasons for the run-up thus far this year are widespread, ranging from a reduction in interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve to geopolitical unrest to the uncertainty surrounding this year’s presidential election.\n\"The wide dispersion of potential outcomes in elections, interest rates, and geopolitical situations globally has created volatility and pockets of opportunity, which the banks have benefited from,\" Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg told Yahoo Finance.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nMarkets currently see the US election as the most volatile event before the end of 2024, based on implied volatility tracked by Citigroup, followed by the October jobs report scheduled to be released on Nov. 1 and third quarter earnings for star chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\nSome on Wall Street aren’t waiting for Election Day and said they are already making trading moves as they anticipate a win by Republican Donald Trump.\nThey include Dan Loeb, founder and CEO of hedge fund Third Point, who has said his firm has purchased stocks and options that could benefit from a Trump administration.\n\"We believe the proposed ‘America First’ policy’s tariffs will increase domestic manufacturing, infrastructure spending, and prices of certain materials and commodities,\" Loeb told Third Point investors last week in a letter.\n\"We also believe that a reduction in regulation generally and especially in the activist antitrust stance of the Biden-Harris administration will unleash productivity and a wave of corporate activity.\"\nThere is certainly the risk that too much chaos or uncertainty can lead to lower trading activity or even higher losses in extreme cases.\nBut volatility surrounding an event is generally viewed on Wall Street as a positive for trading desks that typically don’t actively hold positions for long periods.\n\"We're in the moving business, not the storage business, so to speak,\" Bank of America’s DeMare said.\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-10-22T19:50:17.000Z",
        "article_content": "Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5. In 2020, news organizations were confident enough to call the race for Joe Biden on Election Day night, which is the usual outcome. The only modern exception was the 2000 election, which hinged on a recount in Florida and took more than a month to decide.\nThe 2024 election could entail another delayed outcome — and this year, traders are getting in on the action.\nDonald Trump’s new company, Trump Technology and Media Group (DJT), has become a sort of proxy bet on whether Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, will win or lose. If Trump wins, his company, known by its ticker symbol DJT, could become a hub of info for the new president and everybody in his orbit through the Truth Social media app. If Trump loses, by contrast, Truth Social, an also-ran behind goliaths such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X, will end up as a rump single-purpose Trump megaphone with little value.\nFor the last several months, the buying and selling of DJT shares has been a key “Trump trade” — a bet on whether Trump or his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, will win the 2024 election. Investors now seem to be betting on the timing of the election outcome through option contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell the stock in the future at a certain price. Options expire, typically on Fridays, so an investor buying an option is placing a timed bet. If investors were betting on DJT surging or crashing right after Election Day, they’d be piling into option contracts that expire Nov. 8, three days later.\nBut they’re not. The heaviest action by far is in DJT option contracts that expire Nov. 15, 10 days after Election Day. The amount of “open interest,” or number of contracts traded, is nearly eight times higher for the Nov. 15 vintage than for Nov. 8. After Nov. 15, the open interest plunges.\n“People think we’re not going to know the election results on Election Day, or even on Nov. 8,” said Eric Hale, founder and CEO of Trader Oasis. “Traders betting on the election are betting on a Nov. 15 outcome.”\nIt’s plausible. Most of the seven swing states — Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada — appear to be dead heats that could easily be decided by less than 1% of the vote. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin prohibit the counting of mail-in ballots until Election Day, which slows the tally. Arizona and Nevada also tend to have slow vote counting. And this time around, both parties have armies of lawyers ready to contest any irregularity in court.\nIn 2020, Pennsylvania took five days to certify Biden’s win in the state, even though news networks projected the outcome on Election Day. Financial markets can move on wisps of information, so in a close vote count this year, DJT would likely be moving on hints that the final tally will go one way or another, well ahead of any official count.\nThe election will be a reckoning for DJT, which went public in March at around $50. The company has little revenue and poor financial performance — and would probably have no chance if not for Trump’s presidential bid, which could bring millions of new users if he wins. The stock's value has yo-yoed this year, in sync with Trump's electoral fortunes, hitting a high of $66 in March and a low of $12 in September. It's been on an upswing since the beginning of October, with shares up 108% to about $33.50.\nThe stock is massively volatile, with an “implied volatility,” or IV, of around 300%. That’s off the charts. IV reflects the range of bets traders are placing on the future price of the stock. An IV of around 20% is normal. A stock’s IV might surpass 100% prior to an unusual event such as a clinical trial for a make-or-break pharmaceutical. Hardly any company reaches Trumpian levels of volatility.\nOption traders love volatility because it represents an unusual chance to score a big profit with manageable levels of risk. “Volatility is a shiny thing for traders, and right now DJT is the shiniest that exists,” said Hale. DJT is similar to a meme stock that trades for reasons unrelated to the company’s fundamentals, except for one thing: The 2024 election is a singular event that will have a binary outcome and possibly determine the company’s fate.\nStandard formulas for pricing an option trade suggest DJT stock could go as high as $39.35 or as low as $16.33 within two weeks of Election Day. What the trading data doesn’t reveal is which outcome, up or down, is more likely. Traders often hedge bullish bets on a higher price with bearish bets on a lower price, hoping to profit by finding gaps or spreads giving them an edge no matter what the outcome.\nFrenzied option betting, such as that on DJT, also requires market-makers selling options to buy more actual stock in order to keep their own risks neutral. That in itself can push the stock price up, creating the false impression of bullish sentiment when, in reality, the buying is driven by temporary derisking that will subside.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nBetting markets are another Trump trade that has moved in Trump’s favor recently. From late August to early October, Trump and Harris were within a couple points of each other in betting markets, with Harris ahead for part of that time. But Trump is now ahead by roughly 60% to 40% in the RealClearPolitics aggregate, drawn from eight betting pools operated offshore, which Americans are not allowed to bet on but probably do through cryptocurrency and anonymous accounts.\nPolymarket has drawn attention because of one “whale” known as Fredi9999 who has wagered more than $18 million on Trump winning the electoral vote, the popular vote, and certain states. The Wall Street Journal recently posited that one individual controls the Fredi account, plus three others accounting for $30 million in Polymarket wagers on Trump. Large wagers can change betting odds in their own right because they sometimes force bookmakers to adjust the odds just to assure they’re not overexposed to a small bet or group of bets.\nBetting markets don’t reflect a candidate’s real election odds. One simple reason is that people who participate in betting markets are self-selected and don’t necessarily represent the electorate. Most political analysts say betting markets overstate Trump’s odds, with the presidential race essentially too close to call.\nThose rising odds for Trump could make traders more eager to bet on DJT, however, pushing the stock’s volatility even higher than it would otherwise be. And this is all before any meaningful counting of votes.\nThe unruly 2024 election is also, for the time being, a surreal investing opportunity.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "A likely Biden-Trump rematch is top of mind for investors as former president Donald Trump moves closer to clinching the GOP nomination.\nFor investors, history suggests a strong pre-election year will carry over into the following year. Analysis from Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick found the S&P 500 has recorded gains every election year after a 20%-plus gain in the pre-election year.\nAnd while history shows stocks usually go up regardless of which party is in the White House, analysis from Goldman Sachs found that Tech is usually the worst-performing sector in the year leading up to the general election, while Utilities and Consumer Staples tend to outperform.\nIn the near term, President Biden’s green energy push, crackdown on fossil fuels, and escalating tech war with China are among the top issues for investors. For Trump, the former president’s trade agenda, along with his pledge to \"drill baby, drill,\" have different implications for stock portfolios.\nEnergy policy will likely be a priority for both sides of the aisle in November.\nThough critics of Biden’s renewable energy push argue he's waged a war on fossil fuels, the sector has performed quite well under the current administration. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) have reported record profits, and US oil production has hit record levels.\nBut Trump’s campaign promise to deregulate energy production and abolish current renewable energy subsidies will be another boon to the oil industry, according to Keith Bliss, global head of markets and strategy for BloxCross.\n\"Big oil will be able to export as much as possible to new markets,\" Bliss told Yahoo Finance. \"When you sum up the reduction in cost, the access to new markets, the reduction in regulation costs, and the ability to produce additional products with increased feedstock, then Big Oil will make even more money.\"\nOn the other hand, Bliss warned that oil giants will \"struggle\" if President Biden is reelected, arguing the administration will likely become \"more aggressive.\"\nNo matter who wins, some industries will be facing an uphill battle.\nBoth Trump and Biden’s aggressive stances toward China have the potential to \"rattle investors and corporate decision makers,\" warned China Beige Book’s Shehzad Qazi.\n\"I think we're going to see a lot of aggressive maneuvers on the China front,\" Qazi told Yahoo Finance.\nTrump’s decision to target China with tariffs as high as 25% during his first term put investors on edge, while Biden's initiatives to crack down on China’s technological advancements placed chip giants in the crosshairs.\nPortfolio Wealth Advisors president Lee Munson warned that while neither candidate is good news for chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), Trump could pose a bigger risk.\n\"Biden has not been friendly to China, but Trump's going to be even worse,\" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. \"When you look at Trump, he's mercurial and could just cut off the tap... and tell Nvidia they can’t sell anything.\"\nA total ban could be a massive hit to American chip giants. China accounted for about one-third of the sector’s global sales in 2023, with AI leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) generating at least 20% of their revenue from the country.\n\"Companies that rely on China for sales or for supply chains are going to have to adapt,\" Munson added.\nSince Biden took office, electric vehicle sales have more than quadrupled as automakers jumped on board with the administration's ambitious EV sales goals. But the transition is proving costly for traditional automakers.\nFord (F) recorded a $1.3 billion loss in its EV division in its most recent quarter; General Motors (GM) is also losing money on its EVs.\n\"They haven't figured out the EV market yet, and if Biden comes back in, the government will keep pushing the EV story,\" Bliss said. \"The Big Three could continue to struggle.\"\nHigher manufacturing costs have driven up EV price tags, making affordability an issue. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that the company needs to lower its costs to succeed.\n\"We're seeing mainstream customers who are interested in EVs, but they're not convinced, and they're not going to pay a big premium,\" Farley said. \"So what it means for the [manufacturers] is cost — we have to dramatically reduce the cost.\"\nInvestments that take into account environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have become a top target for Republicans ahead of the 2024 election.\nTrump has been vocal about his opposition to ESG initiatives in the past, promising to support \"a law to keep politics away from Americans’ retirement accounts forever.\"\nDuring the final months of his term, he pushed to discourage employers from considering ESG issues for retirement plans, a rule later reversed by Biden.\nThe increased skepticism and scrutiny of sustainable funds from politicians and regulators has had a chilling effect on fund flows. Investors pulled a total of $13 billion from US sustainable funds in 2023, the worst year on record, according to Morningstar's data.\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "An investor dubbed the “French whale” has sparked fascination with his lavish bets on the outcome of this year’s US presidential election. Fredi9999, as one of his accounts is known, is wagering at least $30 million that Donald Trump will win in the Polymarket prediction market.\nThat’s peanuts compared with what may be the biggest bet of all on the 2024 election, which is what Trump himself stands to gain — or lose. Through his ownership stake in Trump Media and Technology Group, the stakes for Trump amount to at least $4 billion, which is more than all the presidential election bets on Polymarket combined.\nTrump Media, known by its ticker symbol, DJT, is broadly viewed as the one financial asset serving as a binary bet on whether Trump wins or loses the presidential race. If Trump wins, DJT, which houses the Truth Social networking app, could gain a surge of users and revenue, making it a viable social media network able to compete with the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook. But if Trump loses, DJT’s already weak financials could erode further, threatening the whole business. Some investors think the stock could go to 0, imperiling the company.\nShares of DJT have been wildly volatile during the last two months, surging or crashing based on market perceptions of whether Trump is likely to win. There’s a tight correlation between Trump’s odds in betting markets and the direction of DJT shares.\nIn mid-September, for instance, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris pulled ahead of Trump in betting markets. DJT shares sank and closed September at $12.15, the lowest level since the company went public back in March.\nThen Trump’s election odds improved, hitting 64% in the Real Clear Politics aggregate on Oct. 29. On the same day, DJT closed at $51.51, a 324% gain from its September low. There was no company news during that time indicating any sort of improvement in the company’s financial or operating performance, which is weak.\nDuring the last few days, Trump’s election odds have fallen to around 55%, while DJT shares have slipped to about $31. Polls show the two candidates are essentially tied, with Harris possibly benefiting from a wisp of last-second momentum.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nTrump owns 57% of DJT, and the value of his stake has yoyo-ed in proportion to the stock price and his election odds. In July, before Harris replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, DJT’s market value was around $7.7 billion, putting the value of Trump’s portion at about $4.4 billion. At its low point in September, DJT was worth $2.4 billion, with Trump’s share at $1.4 billion. After the October surge, DJT was worth $10 billion, and Trump’s share $5.7 billion.\nSo from the September bottom to the October top, the value of Trump’s shares varied by $4.3 billion. That’s probably the minimum loss Trump would suffer if he loses the election, because that swing is based on a minimum DJT price of $12.15. If the stock goes to 0, Trump’s losses from peak to trough would be $5.7 billion, the value of his shares as of Oct. 29.\nMany investors have been placing “Trump trades” on assets they think will do better or worse if Trump gets elected, including buying DJT stock outright or buying options that could pay off based on future movements in the stock price. Other Trump trades include cryptocurrency, private prisons, and gold. But it’s hard to imagine any single investor other than Trump could have more than $5 billion riding on the election outcome, making Trump the ultimate election whale.\nTrump would not be losing $5.7 billion that he actually invested in the company. Trump made little or no financial investment in DJT, instead adding to its value through his personal brand and the attention he’s able to bring to its main product, Truth Social. Other investors plowed about $1 billion into the company in its startup phase, however, and they’d lose much of their principal if the stock collapses. If DJT does crater, the company could still operate as a non-public company if somebody bought it or its owners chose to take it private.\nTrump would still take a massive financial hit if he loses the election and DJT craters. In late October, with DJT near its peak, Bloomberg estimated Trump’s net worth to be around $6.6 billion, and most of that was his stake in DJT. Without that stake, Trump’s net worth might be around $1 billion. That’s obviously a lot, but much of his wealth is illiquid, and if defeated, Trump would face heavy claims on his wealth long into the future.\nTrump is already on the hook for an $83.3 million judgment against him in the E. Jean. Carroll defamation case and for $454 million in a New York fraud trial. Those payments are on pause as Trump appeals them. Trump is still entangled in three criminal cases that could drag on for years as legal bills pile up. Two of those cases are federal cases Trump could have dismissed if he wins the White House — but will likely have to keep fighting if he loses. The third is a Fulton County, Ga., case that Trump can’t close down even if he’s president.\nIf Trump loses, he would also endure reputational damage as a 78-year-old two-time presidential loser with no obvious next move. Trump stokes his fame, branding power, and fundraising ability by constantly staying in the news and frequently delighting his followers. If he fades into the background, all of that fades with him. All told, it could mark the greatest financial stake ever in the outcome of a presidential election.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-11-07T09:01:08.000Z",
        "article_content": "(Reuters) -Donald Trump has been elected US president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House.\nHere is what companies in Asia have invested in the United States, what Trump has said about them and what potential business policy changes would mean for Asian companies.\nAsian chipmakers, led by Taiwan's TSMC (TSM) and South Korea's Samsung Electronics (005930.KS, SSNLF), have announced plans to invest at least $117 billion in the U.S. in total, encouraged by the current U.S. administration's key initiative aimed at lowering its reliance on Asia for high-end chips.\nIn return, they have received or been pledged grants and financial support amounting to at least $18.85 billion, according to Reuters' calculation.\nIt's unclear if Trump would roll back the scheme, which he called \"bad.\" He made comments on the campaign trail that Chinese-claimed Taiwan should pay to be protected and also accused the island of stealing business from American semiconductor companies.\nTaiwan's GlobalWafers said on Thursday it expects the subsidy programme to continue in a Trump administration.\nTrump has floated the idea of a 10% or more tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., a move he says would eliminate the trade deficit.\nHe has also threatened a 200% tariff on some imported cars, and is particularly determined to keep cars from Mexico from coming into the country. The tariff would hit multiple Asian automakers including Honda Motor (HMC, 7267.T), Nissan Motor (7201.T, NSANY) and Kia Corp. (000270.KS)\nHonda chief operating officer Shinji Aoyama warned on Wednesday that tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico would have a huge impact as the company sends 80% of its production there to the U.S. market.\nHe said if such measures became permanent, Honda would have to consider shifting production to the U.S. or another tariff-free country in the long run.\nSouth Korean battery makers and Japan's Panasonic (6752.T, PCRHY), which have multiple EV battery factories operating in the United States, are now bracing for a potential rollback of President Joe Biden's signature clean energy policy and looser emissions regulations.\nTrump told Reuters in August that he may eliminate a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases.\nSince 2023, LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) and SK On have received 2.6 billion won ($1.9 million) in U.S. federal credits for making battery cells in the United States, according to Reuters' calculation based on their stock exchange filings.\nWithout those manufacturing credits, they would have posted losses, the companies said.\nHowever, U.S. restrictions on Chinese batteries may remain in place or toughen under a second Trump administration, a policy that would benefit rival South Korean producers.\nThe U.S. government has yet to approve Nippon Steel's (5401.T, NPSCY) $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel (X), a politically sensitive deal due to opposition from the U.S. firm's labour union.\nTrump has said he would block the deal, as he has sought to woo union voters. Biden has also said he is opposed to the takeover.\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States said in August the deal posed a risk to national security as it threatened the steel supply chain for critical U.S. industries, prompting Nippon Steel to pledge investments worth billions in U.S. Steel facilities that otherwise would have been idled.\nChinese businesses are waiting to see if Trump makes good on a threat to impose tariffs of 60% or more on imports from China, which could kickstart a fresh trade war reminiscent of the one he waged during his 2017-2021 presidency.\nThe trade war hit sectors across the board, from manufacturers of vacuum cleaners to machinery, with tariffs imposed on more than $200 billion of goods. The Biden administration has kept most of the tariffs in place.\nSeveral Chinese companies were also hit with export controls by the Trump administration citing national security, such as Huawei Technologies, which was barred from purchasing high-end chips, crippling its smartphone business.\nOther Chinese tech firms targeted include ByteDance and Tencent (0700.HK, TCEHY), whose respective TikTok and WeChat social media apps came under threat of being banned from operating in the U.S.\nSome Chinese exporters are making plans to accelerate relocation or open factories outside China to cope with Trump's return.\nBut some Chinese tech executives are betting that Trump's combative approach could work in their favour, as U.S. efforts to slow China's technological progress might fail to gain international support.\nNazak Nikakhtar, a Commerce Department official under Trump who knows his current advisers, said she expects a Trump administration to be much more aggressive about export control policies towards China.\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard in Taipei, Heekyong Yang and Hyunjoo Jin in Seoul, Daniel Leussink in Tokyo and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Nicholas Yong)"

        "title": "A strong jobs report complicates Jerome Powell's political dilemma as 2024 election nears",
        "date": "2024-02-02T16:06:24.000Z",
        "article_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's efforts to navigate monetary policy through a white-hot election year just got more complicated.\nA stronger-than-expected jobs report released Friday morning that surprised Wall Street means the central bank is even more likely to move any consideration of interest rate cuts closer to Election Day. Powell already made it clear this week that a cut in March was likely off the table.\nThat places the Fed on a collision course with figures on both sides of the political divide who are ready to attack Powell if the cuts come too soon or too late for their liking. Those critics include Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who offered a new warning Friday likely to raise the pressure on Powell.\n\"I think he's going to do something to probably help the Democrats,\" Trump predicted, saying \"it looks to me like he's trying to lower interest rates for the sake of maybe, getting people elected.\"\n\"I think he's political,\" the former president added of Powell in a new interview with Fox Business's Maria Bartiromo released by the network Friday morning.\nTrump also reiterated that he wouldn't reappoint Powell when the chair's term expires in 2026 and that he has ideas for who might replace him, but \"I can't tell you now.\"\nTrump was the president who initially appointed Powell to his current position back in 2017 before quickly turning on him in the years that followed. There is no evidence that Powell, a Republican, is pushing for monetary policy that would benefit one party or another.\nPowell himself was asked about the political pressure from Trump and other Republicans this week and deflected the question about whether he even wants a third term.\n\"I don't have a stance on that, it's not something I'm focused on,\" he said at a Wednesday press conference.\nFriday's jobs report beat expectations across the board. The US economy created 353,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, well above the 185,000 expected by economists.\nDecember's figures were also revised to show 333,000 jobs created last month.\n\"My first words were 'oh my god,'\" said Jennifer Lee, BMO Capital Markets senior economist, on Yahoo Finance Live Friday morning after seeing the jobs figures.\nThe immediate debate in the aftermath of Friday's jobs report was whether good economic news could be bad news for investors hoping for rate cuts soon.\nLee predicted that the huge beat means a March interest rate cut \"is definitely not happening\" and that the first cut could wait until the second half of the year, perhaps in July.\nJuly is, of course, just months before Election Day and also the same month when Trump will likely be accepting the GOP's presidential nomination for the third time in a row.\nRepublicans are set to pick their nominee the week of July 15 in Milwaukee. Just days later, Powell and the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee will gather in Washington on July 30.\nMarkets began the year predicting there would be six cuts in 2024, three more than estimates from Fed officials, and that the cuts would likely start in March.\nBut policymakers have been pushing back on that timeline, arguing they needed to see more evidence of inflation moving sustainably down to the Fed's target of 2%.\nPowell reiterated that at a press conference this week after the Fed agreed to hold rates steady for the fourth consecutive FOMC meeting, keeping them at a 22-year high.\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nA March cut, he said, is \"probably not the most likely case or what we'd call the base case.\"\n\"I don't think it's likely the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to [cut rates].\"\nHe said that the Fed didn’t need to see \"better data,\" but just \"more good data\" and a \"continuation of the data we have been seeing.\"\nThe new evidence of a strong labor market makes it even more challenging for the Fed to pivot quickly to cuts.\nIt could mean it holds rates higher for longer than some on Wall Street had expected. Investors are now betting the first cut happens in May, according to data from the CME Group.\n\"It does put the Fed in a difficult place,\" said Gregory Daco, EY chief economist.\nAnother recent complication for the Fed was a recent strong GDP number that was cheered by President Biden and other Democrats.\nIn a statement Friday morning, Biden didn't mention the Fed but touted the jobs numbers as showing how \"America’s economy is the strongest in the world.\"\nPowell is a longtime Republican who even once served as an official in the George H.W. Bush administration but has nevertheless become a lightning rod for the conservative wing of the GOP ever since.\nAs far back as last summer, Trump pledged not to reappoint Powell to head the central bank. In a Fox Business interview last August, he charged that Powell was \"always late.\"\nIn addition to Trump, Powell is also likely facing political pressure from the left in the months ahead in the opposite direction.\nA range of liberal senators from Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to Sherrod Brown of Ohio are directly pushed for cuts as soon as possible, saying it would help out homeowners struggling with high mortgage rates.\nIn one sign the leftward pressure is unlikely to abate, Bilal Baydoun of the Groundwork Collaborative reacted to Friday's jobs number by reiterating his call for immediate cuts.\n\"The data is very clear that we never had to sacrifice jobs for lower prices,\" he wrote in a statement. His group is closely aligned with liberal figures like Warren.\nFor his part, Powell has steadfastly tried to avoid the political debate as much as possible saying he and the Fed board will ignore the political pressure.\n\"This year is going to be a highly consequential year for the Fed and for monetary policy, and we're very buckled down, focused on doing our jobs,\" he said during Wednesday's press conference.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-09-04T20:13:07.000Z",
        "article_content": "Since the 1990s, most presidential elections have featured big battles over healthcare: How to lower costs and expand coverage, and what role the government should play.\nNot this year. Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump both have a variety of piecemeal policies, but the big fights involve inflation, taxes, immigration, and trade. In open-ended questions, only 2% of respondents tell Gallup that healthcare is the nation’s top problem.\nAn unheralded development helps explain why healthcare is receding as a voter concern: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010 with no Republican support, now covers a record number of Americans and is more popular than ever. A program many Americans despised at the outset has now become an integral source of coverage for 45 million Americans.\nObamacare, as it’s known, got off to a rocky start when its main provisions went into effect in 2014. Many Americans with individual insurance plans lost cheap coverage and had to pay more for benefits they didn’t necessarily want. Obama earned the Politifact “lie of the year” distinction for the infamous claim, “If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it.”\nThe ACA covered a few million people in its first full year, but patients blamed it for higher costs and other problems. From 2014 through 2017, more people opposed the law than approved of it. Republicans who opposed the ACA from the start tried to kill it in the courts and repeal it in Congress, but couldn't. Trump vowed to \"repeal and replace\" Obamacare when he ran for president in 2016, but a repeal effort failed in Congress the following year even though Trump was president and Republicans controlled the House and the Senate.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nEven Democrats weren’t satisfied. One of the biggest issues in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries was “Medicare for All,” a huge government-run health plan that supplants the existing system. Progressives including Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and — yes — Harris felt Obamacare didn’t go far enough, and the government should simply cover everybody. Joe Biden had a different plan: Forget Medicare for All and simply patch up Obamacare so it would cover more people.\nBiden’s pragmatic approach helped him win the Democratic primaries and the general election against Trump, and he has, in fact, done what he promised. Biden signed into law measures that expanded eligibility for Obamacare and added subsidies for higher-income families, which last through 2025.\nThat brought coverage levels under the ACA to new record highs, while the program grew in popularity. About 45 million Americans — 15% of the population — now get health coverage under one of the ACA provisions, mostly through a marketplace plan or through expanded Medicaid. The uninsured rate has plunged from 16% in 2010 to 7.7% in 2023. From its low point in 2013, public approval of the ACA has soared from 33% to 62%.\nThe ACA would cover even more people, but 10 states — Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Kansas, Wyoming, and Wisconsin — haven’t adopted Medicaid expansion, which limits the options for low-income residents of those states to get coverage. The remaining uninsured are mostly people who don’t get coverage through an employer and feel they don’t need it or still can’t afford it. (Contrary to some propaganda, undocumented migrants don’t qualify for any federal coverage.)\nVoters trust Democrats considerably more than Republicans on healthcare, which helps offset Democratic weaknesses on immigration and the economy. Harris, now the Democratic presidential candidate, wants to frame healthcare as an economic issue, which it assuredly is. She no longer supports Medicare for all, and her plans are more marginal efforts to address ongoing problems one by one. They include efforts to cancel medical debt, negotiate more drug prices through Medicare, and make permanent the ACA subsidies that expire in 2025.\nTrump insists that \"Obamacare sucks,\" but he's gone from trying to repeal it to saying he'll make it better and cheaper, without explaining how. Maybe he noticed that Obamacare's approval rating is nearly 20 points higher than his own and that voters appreciate having healthcare.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "With the 2024 election just months away, we wanted to take a look at some of the top penny stocks to buy. All of which could benefit from whoever wins.\nLook at gold, for example.\nIf we go back to the presidential elections of 2004 through 2020, we can see that in the months leading up to the election, gold prices push higher on election uncertainty.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nBefore the 2016 election, gold rallied from a January low of $1,061 to a high of $1,308 by the election. Gold then plummeted post-election to a low of about $1,125 before recovering to $1,309.30 by December. Before the 2020 election, gold jumped from a January low of about $1,519.70 to $1,912.20 by November. Post-election, gold dipped to about $1,776.50 and would go on to hit a high of $1,962.50 by December.\nEven cannabis stocks should move heading into the election, especially with a key legalization vote in Florida. Plus, with 88% of the American public for legalization, any candidate that positively mentions it could see an uptick in votes.\nAlso, since we are talking about penny stocks to buy, be cautious.\nPer the US SEC, “Investors in penny stock[s] should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment.”\nThat being said, here are just a few top penny stocks to buy now.\nSource: Shutterstock\nAt $3.60, IMGOLD (NYSE:IAG) is a buy on weakness.\nFor one, it’s technically oversold at support dating back to April. It’s also over-extended on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R. Two, gold prices could see $3,000 over the next 12 months, say analysts at Citi. All thanks to a combination of strong physical demand, central bank purchases, and macroeconomic factors that continue to support gold prices.\nPlus, IAG earnings have been solid. In its first quarter, earnings per share of 11 cents beat by eight cents. Revenue of $338.9 million, up about 50% year over year, beat by $49.58 million.\nEven better, its operations at Essakane and Westwood are on target to meet their goals this year. The company also announced its first gold pour at its Cote Gold mine in Canada, which is expected to be “within the largest operating gold mines in Canada with an expected mine life exceeding 18 years and significant opportunities for growth,” says the company.\nSource: Hudozhnica_Ananas / Shutterstock\nUndervalued at $4.03, Curaleaf Holdings (OTCMKTS:CURLF) could rocket as we near the election.\nFor one, it should also benefit from rescheduling and potential legalization in Florida.\nRemember, as I noted on May 16, “The Supreme Court’s decision to allow the legalization of cannabis to appear on ballots this November holds the key to unlocking a potential tripling of the total cannabis market in Florida to $6 billion in sales, as noted by Benzinga.com.”\nTwo, Alliance Global Partners just raised its price target to $12. And while recent earnings weren’t anything to write home about, those numbers should improve with potential legalization in Florida, and its global footprint in Europe following legalization in Germany.\nThree, CURLF is technically oversold on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R. In fact, when it gets this low on those indicators, the stock bounces back. We saw the same setup and bounce back in March, Oct. 2023, Aug. 2023, April 2023 and Sept. 2022.\nSource: ppart / Shutterstock\nOversold shares of Taseko Mines (NYSEAMERICAN:TGB) could rally significantly higher as well.\nFor one, copper prices could soar another 50%, according to Jeff Currie, chief strategy officer of Energy Pathways at Carlyle, as noted by Fortune.com. He also pointed to high demand and tight supply, which could send copper to $15,000.\nTwo, we will see an even higher demand for copper with artificial intelligence, a greater need for data centers, and the green energy boom.\nHelping, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald just upgraded the TGB stock to a speculative buy with a price target of $5. Analysts at National Bank also raised their price target on Taseko Mines to $4.25, with a sector-perform rating. In addition, company director Russell Hallbauer just bought 70,000 shares of TGB at an average price of $3.38 a share.\nTGB is also technically oversold at $2.30 support, where it’s a buy. From here, I’d like to see the TGB stock initially retest its prior high of $3.20.\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "date": "2024-11-04T11:03:09.000Z",
        "article_content": "Election Day is almost here. The looming question remains how a Donald Trump or Kamala Harris victory will shape the market narrative for the rest of the year and beyond.\nInvestors should soon learn the answer, with Americans heading to the polls on Tuesday. In the week before the election, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 1.37% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5% despite hitting its first record close since June during the week. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just over 0.1%.\nIt's not the only big event of the week. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy decision, with markets largely anticipating that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point.\nEarnings season rolls on with a week headlined by reports from Palantir (PLTR), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Moderna (MRNA).\nOne of the top potentially market-moving events that strategists have discussed throughout the year has finally arrived with the 2024 presidential election slated for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\nBut it's been an abnormal election year for markets. When analyzing the S&P 500's average intraday trading range, Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick found that this past October was the second-least volatile month leading into an election in the past 50 years.\nZooming out further, research from Bespoke Investment Group shows the S&P 500 had its best start to an election year since 1932, with a 20% year-to-date return for the benchmark index through the end of October.\nStill, Election Day itself is considered a risk event for markets. Speculation has built that a \"Trump Trade\" has been forming in markets as the betting odds of the former president winning the election have risen. But some market strategists aren't convinced there's a clear read on what outcome investors will be rooting for come Tuesday.\n\"I think the market would do fine with Harris,\" Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. \"I think the market would do fine with Trump. I don't think the stock market is really pricing any presidential odds.\"\nFranklin Templeton chief markets strategist Stephen Dover told Yahoo Finance that the key for markets could simply be getting past the event itself.\n\"Just having those elections settled, whichever way it goes, would be positive,\" Dover said.\nBaird market strategist Michael Antonelli agreed, telling Yahoo Finance that the riskiest scenario from the election is \"one where we just don't know the winner.\"\nMarkets are widely expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points when it announces its next policy decision on Nov. 7.\nThe key question entering the meeting is what the Federal Reserve will (or won't) signal about its plans for future meetings. Given that data has continued to show an economy pacing for solid growth while inflation's path down to the Fed's 2% goal remains bumpy, markets have moved to price in fewer interest rate cuts over the next year than initially thought when the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18. As of Friday, markets see about three less rate cuts through the end of next year than previously thought.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nMorgan Stanley chief global economist Seth Carpenter doesn't think markets will get much more clarity on the Fed's path in the coming week.\n\"The strength in growth gives the Fed patience as it allows policy easing to be gradual,\" Carpenter wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"Neither inflation nor unemployment is forcing the Fed's hand. We do not expect Powell to give specific guidance on the size or cadence of future cuts. Policy remains data-dependent, and neither the September 50 [basis point] cut nor the November 25 [basis point] cut indicates the future pace.\"\nThe market's debate over how much easing the Fed will enact over the next year has sent the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) soaring since the last Fed meeting in September. The 10-year added about 7 basis points on Friday to close near 4.36%, its highest level since early July.\nBaird investment strategist Ross Mayfield told Yahoo Finance that the move in rates, and the overall focus on the economic data driving them higher, is overshadowing what's shaping up to be another solid quarter of corporate results.\nWith 70% of the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results, the benchmark index is pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 5.1%. This would mark the fifth straight quarter of earnings growth as the index continues to rebound from the earnings recession seen in 2023. \n\"We went through a two-year period where earnings were flat,\" Mayfield said. \"They were volatile. Now we have earnings on the rise again. They're beating analyst expectations at a pretty solid clip. Profit margins are expanding. So the big picture is things look pretty good.\"\nAnd that story appears to be staying intact for the fourth quarter too. Since the period began at the start of October, analysts have cut estimates by 1.8%, according to FactSet data. This is in line with the average cut to earnings seen over the past 10 years.\n\"At a certain point, earnings have to take the baton,\" Mayfield said. \"I think we're in a good position for earnings to do that.\"\nWeekly Calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: Factory orders, September (-0.5% expected, -0.2% prior), Durable goods orders, September (-0.8% expected, -0.8% prior)\nEarnings: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B), Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), Constellation Energy (CEG), Goodyear (GT), Hims & Hers (HIMS), Marriott International (MAR), Palantir (PLTR), Wynn (WYNN)\nTuesday (Election Day)\nEconomic data: ISM services index, October (53.8 expected, 54.9 prior)\nEarnings: Apollo Global Management (APO), Devon Energy (DVN), Ferrari (RACE), Super Micro Computer (SMCI)\nWednesday\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, the week ended Nov. 1 (-0.1% prior); S&P Global US services PMI, October final (55.3 expected, 55.3 prior); S&P Global US composite PMI, October final (54.3 prior)\nEarnings: Arm Holdings (ARM), AMC (AMC), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Celsius Holdings (CELH), CVS (CVS), Elf (ELF), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM)\nThursday\nEconomic data: Federal Reserve interest rate decision (0.25% interest rate cut expected) Initial jobless claims, week ending Nov. 2 (221,000 expected, 216,00 prior)\nEarnings: Affirm (AFRM), Airbnb (ABNB) Block (SQ), Datadog (DDOG), DraftKings (DKNG), Halliburton (HAL), Hershey (HSY), Moderna (MRNA), Pinterest (PINS), Rivian (RIVN), The Trade Desk (TTD)\nFriday\nEconomic calendar: University of Michigan consumer sentiment, November preliminary (71 expected, 70.5 prior)\nEarnings: Canopy Growth (CGC), Icahn Enterprises (IEP), Sony (SONY)"

        "article_content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 10 Best Stocks to Buy Before US Election Season 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Stocks to Buy Before US Election Season 2024.\nAs if anticipation of rate cuts, the Fed's battle against inflation and keeping up with AI-fueled rally in stocks wasn’t enough for investors, the upcoming election-related anxieties are starting to make the financial markets jittery. There are a number of credible reports out there that discuss the behavior of financial markets during US election years. For example, a Morgan Stanley report analyzed some data to see how the S&P 500 performs during election years. This analysis shows that during presidential election years from 1928 through 2016, the stock market has seen more positive performance than negative. The report also said the election of a Republican president resulted in average gains of 15.3% for the S&P 500, compared to a 7.6% gain when a Democrat president comes in the White House.\nA 2020 report by T. Rowe Price analyzed historical data on the connection between US elections and the stock market and found some interesting patterns. For example, the report said if the stock market performance is strong ahead of elections in the US, data shows that chances of the incumbent party staying in power increase. On the other hand, when the stock market is soft heading into elections, incumbent party often loses. But does that mean President Joe Biden could notch a second term if the Fed begins to cut rates in the summer and stocks keep gaining ahead of the election? That would be wrong conclusion to deduce from this pattern as the T. Rowe report shed light on a plethora of factors that affect the relationship between the stock market performance and election results. The report also said historical data shows if the incumbent party loses an election, a recession year follows:\nIf you were to ask an average American today about the hottest issues that would be the point of focus in the US election this year, chances are that their answer would be inflation. But we are still months away from the election and a lot could change. Morgan Stanley analyst Michael D. Zezas recently said in a report that in 2008 expectations were that the elections would move around the US foreign policy. But the financial crisis changed everything. Similarly, presidential candidates in the US election 2020 focused their energies on healthcare and pandemic.\nPhoto by History in HD on UnsplashMethodology For this article we went through multiple research reports and analyses of experts who took a look at what stocks and sectors usually benefit during election years. We picked 10 stocks which analysts are specifically recommending investors in 2024 because of election-related catalysts. Some top names include JPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "article_content": "With the latest polls showing the two presidential candidates — Donald Trump and Kamala Harris — within a couple points of each other, the election could easily swing either way in November.\nYes, you should exercise your right to vote, and yes, feel free to enjoy some thoughtful and friendly debating with your friends and family who feel differently about politics. But don’t forget to prepare financially for an unpredictable future.\nRead Next: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for Social Security If Kamala Harris Wins the Election\nFor You: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nIn other words, start saving now, because nobody knows exactly what’s coming down the pike. Here are six reasons to save money ahead of the election — regardless of who you think is going to win.\nTrending Now: Boomers Hold Half of U.S. Wealth--So Why Are Thousands Living Without Homes?\n“Economic uncertainty often follows elections,” said Doug Carey, CFA, founder of WealthTrace. “By building your savings now, you create a financial buffer, no matter how the next president’s policies affect the economy or financial markets.”\nWhile you can’t count on favorable policies or a strong economy, you can put yourself in a strong position to weather any storm that comes your way.\nLearn More: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for Social Security if Trump Wins the 2024 Election\nAttorney Amy Loftsgordon, who serves as an editor at Nolo, noted that major tax changes are scheduled for the end of next year.\n“Many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, such as an increase in the standard deduction and the lowering of income tax brackets, are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025,” she said. “While that might sound like a long way off, now is a good time to start preparing for potential changes to tax laws by increasing your savings in case you need to pay more in taxes.”\nNo matter which candidate wins, Congress would need to take action to change the sunsetting tax rules. Some rules may expire either way, other popular changes may get extended either way, and some new rules will likely enter the mix. Prepare now for changing tax rules.\nThe U.S. economy isn’t out of the inflation woods yet. In fact, some experts argue that it will take years to recover from inflation if Trump wins, while just as many see prolonged inflation under a Harris administration.\n“While inflation is no longer at a 40-year high, the cost of almost everything from groceries to borrowing money remains elevated,” said Loftsgordon.\nIf you pick a policy proposal from either candidate, from tariffs or greater government spending to more subsidies and tax credits, you can argue that they’re all potentially inflationary.\n“When inflation and rates are high, it makes sense to put money in savings, as well as pay down your existing debts, rather than spend your available money,” she added.\nThe math just isn’t pretty on Social Security spending. Fixing it would require large benefit cuts or tax hikes — both of which are unpopular to put it mildly. That’s why neither party seems able to tackle the problem, and the House Budget Committee forecasts that Social Security will be insolvent by 2033 without any fixes.\nTherefore, you just can’t count on the same Social Security benefit levels that past retirees have enjoyed. Prepare to pay for your own retirement, so you don’t find yourself broke in your golden years.\nPeople love to blame presidents and other politicians for every single woe in their lives. But you are ultimately responsible for your personal finances, not whoever sits in the Oval Office.\nYou control your career choices, your savings rate and your investment decisions. Focus your energy on what you can control. Your future self will thank you for having more options available, because you saved and invested more money now.\nIn general, saving and investing earlier yields exponentially greater wealth. Imagine you wait until your 50s, and you want to save up $1 million in the next 10 years for retirement. At a (generous) 10% return, you’d have to invest nearly $5,000 each month.\nIf you started just five years earlier, and have 15 years for your investments to compound, you can invest less than half as much each month (under $2,500) to hit that $1 million goal. And if you give yourself 20 years, you can reach $1 million by investing around $1,330 monthly — all thanks to the power of compound interest.\nSo start now, and by the time the next president leaves office, you’ll find yourself in a far greater position financially.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "It’s finally here. Not the election itself, but the clearest opportunity yet to bet on election winners and losers.\nInvestors have been eyeing the election all year, since the outcome has major implications for tax policy, trade, immigration, and many companies that could benefit or suffer from forthcoming changes. But many factors affect the value of stocks and other assets, including economic developments and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. Inflation and jobs data, plus the Fed’s interest rate cuts, have largely been driving markets for most of 2024.\nThose factors are now fading into the background, at least until Election Day on Nov. 5. The latest reports on jobs and inflation show, reassuringly, that the economy remains strong as inflation fades. There won’t be any interest rate news out of the Fed until after the election, so Wall Street is looking for different market-moving triggers.\nTheir names are Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. In an Oct. 11 report, analysts at Citi explained “how to trade the US election,” based not just on who wins the White House but on which party controls each chamber of Congress. “With September [jobs] out of the way, Election Day quickly approaching, and polls being quite close, elections should now become a much larger, more consistent driver of markets,” the Citi analysts explained.\nOrdinary investors might want to sit this one out. There are countless permutations of stock, bond, commodity, and currency price fluctuations that could occur as markets price in a Harris or Trump victory. “It’s all about getting through the event and having a clear winner on Nov. 6,” said Jeff Hirsch, editor in chief of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. “Specific stocks and sectors vis a vis the two candidates are less important, from my perspective.”\nThat won’t stop active traders from speculating on the election outcome, and the action could temporarily affect the direction of 401(k) plans and other routine investments. The stock market typically rises during an election year, as it has in 2024, with the S&P 500 up 22% so far. But October can be shaky. Volatility jumps and stocks tend to wobble. So far this month, volatility has tipped upward, on cue, with stocks up a tad.\nElection bets are based on four basic scenarios: Harris or Trump winning with their party gaining full control of Congress, or Harris or Trump winning while Congress remains split between Democrats and Republicans. That will determine if the next president governs with a friendly Congress able to pass partisan legislation or with a divided Congress unable to pass the president’s favorite bills.\nWhile the odds of Harris or Trump winning are roughly 50-50, there's a good chance the next president will have a divided Congress. Investing firm Raymond James puts the odds of a Republican sweep with Trump as president at 30%, and the odds of a Democratic sweep with Harris as president at 25%. Harris winning with a split Congress is 25% likely, with a Trump win and divided Congress at 20%.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nEach combo portends different policies affecting markets. Taxes are a prominent example. Harris wants to raise the corporate tax rate, and she might be able to do that if she wins with Democratic control of Congress. Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate and eliminate a variety of other taxes, which he might be able to do if he wins with Republican control of Congress. A divided Congress, with either president, would probably bring the fewest tax changes.\nEither president could impact markets through regulation and other executive actions, with no need for congressional action. The biggest changes under Trump would be more tariffs, protectionist trade wars, and the deportation of migrants. Harris would represent more of the status quo, including the ongoing rollout of billions in green energy subsidies and aggressive support for the Affordable Care Act.\nInvesting firms are busy calculating the first-, second-, and third-order effects of such changes on the value of individual assets. Oppenheimer, for instance, recently highlighted five Trump-friendly stocks and five Harris-friendly stocks. On the Trump ledger: Tractor Supply (TSCO), Goldman Sachs (GS), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and AT&T (T). On the Harris ledger: Five Below (FIVE), KKR (KKR), Sunrun (RUN), AppLovin (APP), and Comcast (CMCSA).\nCiti’s election trades range from broad sectors to more arcane plays involving the strength of the dollar and currency exchanges. Solar stocks, for instance, tend to rise when Harris seems more likely to win, and vice versa. Crypto-related assets do better when Trump’s election odds rise. As for the election-related currency trades, it should suffice to say, don’t try this at home.\nThe overall market might enjoy a relief rally once the election is finally over, but some shares could rise or fall based on expected changes once there’s more clarity about the next four years.\nInvesting firm Evercore, for instance, points out that the auto and electronics industries would be most exposed to a new Trump trade war. But Trump’s focus on more fossil fuel production could benefit oil and gas producers. Harris wants more caps on drug prices, which could dent drugmaker profits. But her efforts to build more housing could benefit home builders.\nBuy or sell accordingly.\nThere’s also the prospect of a contested election, with no clear winner for days or weeks after Nov. 5. That could spook markets more than any campaign policy. If we dodge that bullet, however, we’ll be back to parsing Fedspeak and scrutinizing economic data in just a few weeks.\nIt'll probably feel welcome.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "US stocks closed Tuesday's trading session in a sea of green as Americans flocked to the polls on Election Day to decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will become the next president.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising about 1.4% to secure its best day since early October. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 1.2%, with the index nabbing its best session since Sept. 19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped 1%, or more than 400 points, as stocks rebounded from a losing day.\nAmericans are heading to the polls with Harris and Trump running neck-and-neck after an intensely contested presidential race. Investors are buckling in for market volatility, as the outcome may not become clear for days, or even weeks, if the result is disputed.\nRead more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet\nGiven the huge difference in the candidates' stances on the economy, a long wait for a declared winner could inject more uncertainty into markets. But historically, while the lack of a clear victory has brought turbulence in the short term, it has rarely halted the long-term trend for gains.\nThe dollar (DX-Y.NB) retreated further on Tuesday as traders dialed back bets on a Trump win.\nMeanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury (^TNX) dropped 2 basis points to hover around 4.29%. It had moved as high as 4.36% earlier in the session before retreating by late afternoon.\nAlso dead ahead is the November policy decision from the Federal Reserve, which also has a lot at stake on Election Day. Chair Jerome Powell is overwhelmingly expected to bring in a 25 basis point rate cut at the end of the two-day meeting on Thursday.\nIn corporates, the bitter seven-week strike at Boeing (BA) has ended after factory workers voted for a new contract offering a 38% pay hike. The plane maker's shares still nearly 3% after initially opening the day higher.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) stock fell about 10% in after-hours trading after the company missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings and sales in the current quarter.\nSuper Micro said it expects second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 to $0.65, below analysts estimates of $0.80. Meanwhile, Super Micro's forecast for net sales in a range of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion was weaker than the $6.79 billion on Wall Street had hoped for.\nThe earnings were released less than a week after accounting firm Ernst & Young resigned as Super Micro's auditor. EY said in a filing it was \"unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management.\"\nSuper Micro responded to those accusations on Tuesday with a response from an independent \"Special Committee\" that had been investigating the accusations.\n\"Following a three-month investigation led by Independent Counsel, the Committee’s investigation to date has found that the Audit Committee has acted independently and that there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors,\" the release said. \"The Committee is recommending a series of remedial measures for the Company to strengthen its internal governance and oversight functions, and the Committee expects to deliver the full report on the completed work this week or next.\"\nAdditionally, Super Micro still hasn't filed its 10-K annual filing, which it initially pushed back on Aug. 29. The company said it \"remains unable at this time to predict when the Form 10-K will be filed.\"\nUS stocks closed firmly in the green on Tuesday as investors flocked to the polls to decide who will become the next president: Republican nominee Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising about 1.4%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped 1%, or more than 400 points, as stocks rebounded from a losing day.\nThe S&P 500 is up a little more than 1% as Americans and anxiously await results on the 2024 presidential race.\nThe rally Tuesday furthered a trend that's been seen for most of the year in the major indexes. Through October, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) had risen about 20%, good for its best gains in the first 10 months of an election year through at least 1950.\nStrategists have warned that this up-and-to-the-right rally could be tested should the election not be decided quickly.\nBut once an outcome is known, markets typically rally. The S&P 500 has been higher the month after the election in 6 of the past 10 cycles, per research from Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick. Over the next three months, the S&P 500 was higher 8 of 10 times.\n\"We could see a jolt of volatility and a knee-jerk reaction once there is more clarity on the election outcome or if the election results take longer to be known,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner wrote in a note to clients on Monday. \"Regardless, our view is investors should continue to focus on the primary trend and try to filter out the short-term noise.\"\nTrump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) was halted for volatility in late afternoon trading on Tuesday as investors brace for more wild swings with Election Day underway in the US.\nShares quickly erased 15% gains and reversed Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week.\nThe stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday, which shaved off around $4 billion from its market cap.\nShares have still more than doubled from their September lows.\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $34 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $6.9 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $4.1 billion.\nBoeing (BA) shares retreated from modest gains in late afternoon trading on Tuesday after the company struck a deal with its machinists union Monday evening. 59% of the group voted to approve the deal and end the nearly two-month-long strike, which cost the company billions.\nWhile the union did not get the restoration of pensions it fought for, workers will receive a 38% wage increase over the next four years, a $12,000 cash bonus to hourly workers, and a boost in contributions to retirement savings plans.\nAnalysts said the resolution of the strike should set the stage for a Boeing recovery. The stock has declined roughly 40% since the start of the year.\n\"Boeing CEO, Kelly Ortberg, added another check to the 'Boeing Turnaround' list,\" Bank of America analysts wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, although the group warned that any type of recovery won't happen overnight.\n\"While the strike ending and workers returning to the shopfloor is a meaningful step in the right direction, ramping [production] back up will take time.\"\nRead more here.\nYahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports:\nNew economic policy promises typically aren't rolled out during the final weeks of a presidential campaign. But that's one more norm Donald Trump and his allies have been upending in recent days.\nThe pledges have been coming fast and furious, including one last escalation of Trump's tariff promises on the final day of campaigning, with the former president pledging to impose new blanket tariffs on Mexico.\n\"You're the first ones I've told it to,\" Trump told a crowd in Raleigh, N.C., on the last full day of campaigning Monday. \"Congratulations, North Carolina.\"\nIt's a pledge that came alongside recent discussions from Trump and his allies of dramatically changing course on a signature Biden-era semiconductor bill that has catalyzed over $400 billion in semiconductor sector investments. There has even been renewed talk of repealing the Affordable Care Act.\nWhether all of this helps Trump's chance in a toss-up contest remains to be seen, but it's yet another factor for last-minute voters to consider as the 2024 contest reaches its end.\nRead more here.\nIn addition to Palantir (PLTR) and Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), some of Tuesday's key stock movers included newly public AI hardware firm Astera Labs (ALAB), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), and other AI chip stocks.\nShares of Nvidia jumped 2.5% midday, while its manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), rose 2.9%.\nChip stocks, including Intel (INTC), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM), also rose amid further evidence of strong AI data center demand evidenced by Astera Labs' sunny third quarter earnings Monday. Astera Labs itself was a top gainer Tuesday, rising roughly 30%.\nMeanwhile, Tesla shares rose 4% as the US presidential election outcome loomed.\nAnalysts' takes were mixed on how Tesla would fare under either candidate — with some seeing the company benefiting from a Trump presidency while others say the EV industry would suffer under Trump. Its CEO, Elon Musk, has been one of Trump's key surrogates in the final months of the campaign.\nAsset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) jumped 6% after quarterly earnings showed its assets reached $733 billion. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nOn the other side of the spectrum, Tuesday's major losers were mining giant Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) — which saw shares fall more than 7% after an earnings miss in part due to its exposure to the auto industry — and drugmaker AstraZeneca (AZN) — which is attempting to break into the massive weight-loss drug market. Its stock fell as much as 7% in response.\nConsumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (XLK) led Tuesday's sector action, with stocks moving higher across the board as Election Day gets underway.\nThe so-called Trump and Harris trades also saw some movement.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) moved about 5 basis points higher to trade around 4.35%. Yields are largely expected to remain elevated under a Trump administration since the former president's tariff policy would likely lead to higher inflation over time.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD), which Trump has outwardly supported, saw prices rise around 4% to trade near $70,300 a token. Prices have been lumpy in recent days, however, as Kamala Harris's odds improved over the weekend.\nGiven that recent movement, Utilities (XLU) have dropped around 2% over the past five days. Utilities typically fall on higher yields, so if the assumption is that a Harris presidency would be less inflationary compared to Trump, that would lead to a drop in yields and, therefore, the Utilities sector at large.\nPalantir (PLTR) stock surged 22% after the company's third quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street's expectations due to a spike in spending from the US Department of Defense on its artificial intelligence tech.\nPalantir’s chief revenue and legal officer, Ryan Taylor, said the company's US government business saw its “strongest sequential growth in 15 quarters driven largely by our DoD [Department of Defense] business's 21% quarter-over-quarter growth.”\nGlobal government spending on Palantir’s products, primarily from the US, rose 40% from the prior year to $408 million in the third quarter, accounting for 56% of the company’s total revenue for the period. This was ahead of the $379 million expected for the segment, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\nOverall, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter, a penny ahead of expectations, on revenue of $725.5 million, which topped the $703.7 million expected by Wall Street analysts.\nRead the full story here.\nTrump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) climbed more than 10% higher in early trading on Tuesday, extending its double-digit rise to kick off the week as shares brace for more volatility with Election Day underway in the US.\nThe stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday, which shaved off around $4 billion from its market cap. Shares have still more than doubled from their September lows.\nThe stock's recovery comes as investors await the election of the next president: Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.\nPrior to the recent volatility, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had been on a steady rise as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory.\nPrediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican.\nAnd as betting markets tighten, national polls show both candidates in a virtually deadlocked race. Polls in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which are likely to decide the fate of the election, also show razor-thin margins.\nHere’s what the betting markets and election forecasters are saying as the 2024 campaign comes to an end.\nPolitical betting app Kalshi recently became the first place where Americans could legally wager on the 2024 election — and the bets have flooded in.\nHeading into Election Day, the site put Trump’s odds at 57% which was akin to “a very slightly biased coin flip,” Kalshi co-founder Tarek Mansour said in a Yahoo Finance appearance Monday\nA compilation of other betting markets from RealClearPolling, spanning other popular sites open to overseas betters from Polymaket to Smarkets, has the odds of a Trump win at 59.2% to 39.3%. Those odds mean that Harris would win almost four contests if the election were run 10 times.\nAs for the polling-based election models, they projected a tighter race.\nNate Silver’s Silver Bulletin model ran its last update at 12:00 a.m. ET on Nov. 5 and found a nearly exact tie in electoral college probability with Harris winning 50% of the time to 49.6% for Trump.\nSilver’s final run featured 80,000 simulations with Harris winning in 40,012 of them, he wrote.\nThe 538.com election model was another toss-up. It found Harris winning 50 out of 100 simulations. Trump won 49 times out of 100 with a less than 1-in-100 chance of no Electoral College winner.\nThe final analysis from the Economist magazine found a slight Harris edge with the vice President winning 56 out of 100 hypothetical contests.\nUS stocks opened mostly higher on Tuesday as Election Day got underway. Markets are in wait-and-see mode when it comes to who will end up in the White House: Kamala Harris or Donald Trump.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, up 0.5%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) opened just above the flatline on the heels of a losing day for stocks.\nElection Day\nEconomic data: ISM services index (October)\nEarnings: Apollo Global Management (APO), Devon Energy (DVN), Ferrari (RACE), Super Micro Computer (SMCI); Restaurant Brands (QSR); Yum Brands (YUM)\nHere are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning:\nThe S&P 500 doesn't care who the next president is\nWhy the Fed has a lot at stake on Election Day\nMusk: It's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers\nPalantir shares surge as AI adoption boosts revenue outlook\nBoeing workers vote for pay deal, ending bitter 7-week strike\nDJT stock jumps again as US heads to the polls\nBankrupt TGI Friday's fears a run on $50 million in gift cards\nElection Day has arrived.\nAnd with it, all the typical banter about outcomes for the country, world, and markets. Amid the heavy news flow, Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner (who will be on the Opening Bid podcast tomorrow at 8 a.m. ET with his post-election analysis) dropped the helpful chart below.\nI think it offers a good reminder that, no matter the outcome of the presidential election, it has paid dividends to be an investor in stocks over time."

        "article_content": "As the 2024 U.S. presidential election fast approaches, endorsements from high-profile billionaires have been pouring in from both sides of the aisle.\nTaylor Swift’s announcement that she will be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris marked another billionaire backing for the Democratic nominee, who currently trails former President Donald Trump in endorsements from the mega-rich. Currently, Harris has the support of almost a dozen billionaires, including familiar names such as hedge fund manager and philanthropist George Soros and investor and television personality Mark Cuban.\nMeanwhile, Trump's Republican ticket has garnered the support of nearly 20 billionaires ahead of November. Tesla owner Elon Musk is not only backing Trump for president, but he says he is also ready to serve in Trump’s cabinet. The outspoken X owner is also planning a new government task force, which Trump has said Musk will lead.\nWhile some have merely shared their statements on social media, others have hosted campaign events or let their massive donations speak for themselves.\nFortune compiled a list of all the billionaire endorsements thus far in the 2024 election cycle:\nGeorge Soros – Founder, Soros Fund ManagementSoros, known for throwing millions at philanthropic and political causes, immediately supported Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. His son and heir, Alex Soros, posted about their support in July.\n“It’s time for us all to unite around Kamala Harris and beat Donald Trump,” the post read. “She is the best and most qualified candidate we have. Long live the American Dream!”\nAccording to Bloomberg, Soros’ Democracy PAC has given $10 million to Future Forward PAC and $5.6 million to American Bridge this election cycle.\nBill Gates – Founder and former CEO, MicrosoftSources close to Gates reportedly told The New York Times that the billionaire, long known for staying out of politics publicly, had donated about $50 million to a nonprofit supporting Harris's run.\nIn a statement to the Times, Gates did not confirm or deny the donation but said, “this election is different.” Gates is reportedly concerned about former President Donald Trump's economic policies and potential cuts to family planning and global health programs.\nJonathan Gray – President, BlackstoneHe may have been considered for Trump’s Treasury Secretary in 2016, but Gray is a major Democratic donor. He supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, donated to multiple Democratic candidates in 2020 and hosted an event for Biden before he dropped out this year.\nDespite being known as a Swiftie, Gray announced his support earlier than Swift, reportedly donating to the Harris campaign shortly after she became the presumptive nominee.\nMarc Lasry – Co-founder, Avenue Capital GroupEarlier this year a person familiar confirmed to Bloomberg that Lasry would be supporting Harris. Lasry reportedly hosted an event for Harris at his New York apartment during the 2020 presidential election cycle and as of July was considering holding another for 2024.\nMark Cuban – Entrepreneur; Former Principal Owner, Dallas MavericksEntrepreneur and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has been very open about his support of Harris on social media, even debating billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk online.\nCuban’s public support has been so strong, some even speculated earlier this summer that Harris might pick Cuban for vice president. He later praised Harris for selecting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\nMelinda French Gates – Co-founder, Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationGates is known for her philanthropy as well as her support of Democratic causes, and was quick to support Harris’s bid for president.\n“I feel like Kamala, I was happy to endorse,” French Gates told Stephen Colbert on The Late Show in July. “I’ve worked with her before, she knows what we need in society and she’s using her voice against those issues already on the campaign trail, and I knew she would.”\nReed Hastings – Co-founder and former CEO, NetflixThe billionaire quickly cut a $7 million check to a super PAC supporting the Harris campaign this year, enthusiastically backing the Democratic nominee after calling for Biden to drop out.\nHastings said earlier in the summer that the U.S. needed “a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous” and Biden should “step aside.”\nReid Hoffman – Co-founder, LinkedIn; Venture CapitalistTech billionaire Reid Hoffman signed onto a letter with fellow venture capitalists, including Cuban, declaring their support for Harris’ White House bid.\nThat letter called Harris’ election, “the best way to support the continued strength, security and reliability of our democracy and economy.”\nRon Conway – Founder, SV AngelConway, a Silicon Valley  “super angel” and philanthropist, signed the same VCs for Kamala letter as Hoffman and Cuban.\nHe wrote on X that the tech industry must come together to, “defeat Donald Trump and save our democracy.” He also wrote: “I have known Kamala for decades, and she's been a fighter, a leader, and an advocate for the tech ecosystem.”\nSheryl Sandberg – Former COO, Facebook (Meta)Sandberg has repeatedly spoken out in support of Harris following her entry to the race. In an Instagram post, Sanberg said she was “thrilled” to back Harris.\n“She will defend women’s rights — and all Americans’ rights — from the Oval Office with a determined, compassionate focus,” Sandberg said.\nVinod Khosla – Founder, Khosla Ventures; Co-founder, Sun MicrosystemsKhosla, a Silicon Valley billionaire, spent over $3 million in 2020 campaigning against Trump and is supporting the Democratic nominee again this year.\nKhosla joined the list of over 850 venture capitalists supporting Harris, the same list signed by Cuban, Hoffman, and Conway.\nTaylor Swift – Award-winning singer/songwriter Swift endorsed Harris after the debate, calling out the use of AI earlier in the election cycle to share a fake video of Swift supporting Trump.\n“Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post announcing her vote. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.\nBill Ackman – CEO and Founder, Pershing Square CapitalBillionaire hedge fund manager Ackman announced on X that he would be endorsing Trump for president in 2024, writing he hasn’t “lost it” but made the decision “rationally.”\n“I assure you that I have made this decision carefully, rationally, and by relying on as much empirical data as possible,” he said at the time.\nDouglas Leone – Former Managing Partner, Sequoia CapitalLeone cited immigration and the growing deficit as key reasons he would be supporting Trump this fall.\nIn a tweet from June, Leone said he’d grown “increasingly concerned” about these issues and would be casting his ballot for the former president. He previously donated to Trump’s 2020 campaign but distanced himself after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nElon Musk – CEO, Tesla and X (formerly Twitter)Musk officially endorsed Trump in July after an attempted assassination on the former president, sharing his support on X.\n“I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” Musk posted at the time, adding later the same day: “Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.”\nHe has remained an outspoken supporter of Trump’s campaign, with his America PAC recently launching a series of ads in September warning that “Kamala and the crazies,” will win if you don’t get out to vote.\nGeoffrey Palmer – Real Estate MagnateReal estate billionaire Geoffrey Palmer has reportedly donated more than $3 million to PACs affiliated with the Trump campaign this year. He’s been major Republican financial supporter for years.\nThe Beverly Hills resident supported Trump in 2016, threw $500,000 at Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign and has donated to multiple Republican campaigns and committees.\nHarold Hamm – Founder, Continental ResourcesThe billionaire Oklahoma oil tycoon has long brought in millions for Trump’s campaigns as well as past GOP candidates. Hamm was even an energy adviser to Romney ahead of 2012.\nThis election cycle, Hamm has donated again to Trump and appeared at his events, helping to rally the oil industry behind the campaign.\nIsaac Perlmutter – Former Chairman and CEO, Marvel EntertainmentIt’s no surprise that Perlmutter, who advised Trump’s administration, said he’d be shelling out money for the former president’s 2024 campaign this year. According to OpenSecrets, he’s donated $10 million toward the election cycle.\nThe billionaire, famous for reviving Marvel comics and selling it to Disney, also donated to Trump in 2020.\nJ. Joe Ricketts – Chairman, TD AmeritradeAccording to Business Insider, Ricketts and his wife gave more than $20 million to GOP causes in 2020, and are again supporting the party in 2024.\nIn fact, Ricketts' son is in politics himself. Former Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts was appointed to the U.S. Senate after former Sen. Ben Sasse opted to retire and is expected to be elected to finish the term.\nJohn Catsimatidis – Owner, Red Apple GroupCatsimatidis, the head of the real estate group Red Apple and a radio talk show host, has a long history with Trump and has backed him financially in the past.\nIn an appearance on NPR earlier this year, Catsimatidis argued that Trump is the better candidate for businesses in the U.S. and defended his legacy. He’s been active this election cycle rallying CEOs to support Trump’s campaign.\nJohn Paulson – Hedge Fund ManagerPaulson has been an outspoken Trump supporter leading up to the 2024 election, and is a GOP megadonor. He’s been especially critical of Harris’ capital gains tax and other economic proposals.\n“If they do implement a 25 percent tax on unrealized gains, that would cause mass selling of almost everything — stocks, bonds, homes, art. I think it would cause a crash in the markets and a pretty quick recession,” Paulson predicted recently.\nKelcy Warren – Founder, Energy TransferAccording to Politico, the pipeline mogul has donated $5 million this election cycle to elect former President Trump. He joined a number of oil industry billionaires who have come out in force to support Trump’s campaign, falling into Trump’s top 10 donors, according to OpenSecrets.\nLinda McMahon – Co-founder, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)McMahon has praised Trump as a “job creator” and appeared at the Republican National Convention (RNC) this summer to endorse and support Trump’s bid for the White House.\nFormerly Trump’s Small Business Administration leader, McMahon donated in 2016 to his first campaign. She has a relationship with Trump going back to 2007, when he appeared on WWE's flagship event WrestleMania.\nLiz Uihlein – Co-founder, UlineAfter initially supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Uihlein family reportedly said they would be donating to Trump’s election bid in March. The megadonors are known for supporting campaigns and causes aligned with conservative values, and backed Trump in the two previous elections, before initially turning to DeSantis for 2024.\nUline Inc. is the number two donor to Trump’s campaign, reportedly shelling out more than $10 million toward his reelection.\nMiriam Adelson – Casino Billionaire and Republican MegadonorPredictably, Miriam Adelson, who previously shelled out $500,000 for Trump’s legal fees, is supporting the former president again in 2024.\nThe Adelson Clinic for Drug Abuse Treatment & Research has reportedly donated $5 million to the Trump campaign this election cycle. She is a longtime Trump ally and was awarded the presidential medal of freedom in 2018.\nPhil Ruffin – Casino MagnateRuffin has been described as one of Trump’s “closest friends” and is a co-owner of the Trump International Las Vegas hotel.\nRuffin donated to Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns as well as his 2024 bid, reportedly giving more than $800,000 this year.\nStephen Schwarzman – CEO, BlackstoneSchwarzman, who supported Trump in the 2016 election and became a trusted adviser in his office, is again supporting Trump in 2024 despite hoping for fresh blood from the GOP earlier in the cycle.\nHe called a vote for Trump a “vote for change” when announcing in May that he would vote for the Republican candidate this fall.\nSteve Wynn – Former Casino MogulWynn, a longtime Trump ally, supported the former president in 2016 and 2020 and is again voting for Trump in 2024. Wynn reportedly donated more than $800,000 to be a co-chair at a Palm Beach fundraiser hosted by Paulson earlier this year.\nThe fundraiser, which was also attended by Hamm and Johnson, benefitted the Trump 47 Committee.\nTimothy Dunn – Texas Oil BusinessmanTexas billionaire Tim Dunn is another oil industry tycoon who has thrown his support behind Trump. According to Politico, Dunn has spent more than $30 million advancing conservative issues in his home state alone, and cut a $5 million check toward Trump’s election.\nTimothy Mellon – Republican Mega-donorMellon, heir to the Mellon Bank fortune, was a top 2020 donor to Trump and, unsurprisingly, he’s backing the GOP candidate again this time around.\nIn July, the “reclusive” megadonor donated $50 million to a pro-Trump super PAC, according to Politico. It's hard to find photos of the billionaire, so we've opted for a photo of his grandfather Andrew Mellon, a former U.S. Treasury Secretary. According to a report by the BBC, Mellon typically donates to Republicans but has occasionally contributed to Democrats, including New York progressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 campaign.\nWoody Johnson – Heir, Johnson & Johnson; Co-owner, New York JetsJohnson, who served as ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2017 to 2021 and is a longtime friend to Trump, threw his support and finances behind the campaign this year.\n“Americans remember how good it was or how much better it was on the border, and inflation, and gas prices, and grocery prices, all that, during the Trump administration, and they want to get back there,” Johnson said in a Fox News appearance in early 2024. “So I think the most important thing is getting the former president back in the White House, which looks like it’s happening.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Election fever is in the air, as we’re just a few months away from finding out who the next president of the U.S. will be. It’s an exciting but also tense and highly contentious time. Millions of Americans are experiencing financial anxiety as we await the results of who will take over the Oval Office in 2025.\nLearn More: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for the Housing Market If Trump Wins the Election\nFind Out: 7 Reasons You Should Consider a Financial Advisor Before Making a Big Investment\nPeople have questions, and some of them who are thinking about buying a house are confused about whether they should buy now or wait until the election is in the rearview mirror.\nAccording to a new survey by Veterans United Home Loans, which polled 900 prospective homebuyers, 60% of people who plan to buy a home in the next three years say the 2024 election is a factor in their purchasing timeline, while 43% plan to wait until after the race is final to buy.\nIs it better to wait until after the election is over to buy? Let’s hear what the experts have to say.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nThat prospective homebuyers — along with home sellers — are currently on the fence about going forward with their plans is no surprise. This is common during presidential election years.\n“The housing market often experiences a slowdown as potential buyers and sellers may hesitate, waiting to see the outcome of the election,” said Nicole Grandelli, a licensed real estate agent and head of sales at Eastlight Condominium at CORE.\nExplore More: Mortgage Rates Are Dropping: 20 Housing Markets With the Most Affordable Home Prices\nProspective homebuyers may be anticipating home prices dropping, depending on who wins the presidential election. But they may be in for a rude surprise.\n“Home prices are unlikely to decrease, and many sellers are holding onto their properties due to low interest rates they secured in the past,” Grandelli said. “Additionally, with limited new inventory coming onto the market, competition remains high. If interest rates do drop in the future, buyers can refinance later to take advantage of lower rates.”\nThe Federal Reserve has more than hinted at cutting interest rates now that inflation is cooling. Waiting until that happens (it could happen as soon as September) is an option, but there’s a caveat: Lower interest rates mean higher demand (which is already an issue with the housing inventory shortage) which means higher housing prices.\n“We will see prices rise as buyers rush to take advantage of lower interest rates,” said Ralph DiBugnara, founder and president at Home Qualified.\nChris Wesser, president and executive chair at Redy, said that generally, the lower the prime interest rate the lower the mortgage interest rate and, therefore, the lower the short-term monthly payment and long-term overall cost of buying a home.\n“History shows us that prime rates often drop in the quarter prior to a national election, and that could be meaningful,” Wesser said.\nAnd now here’s some math to better understand Wesser’s point.\n“Every ¼ point decrease in mortgage interest rates can create meaningful savings in both the short and long terms,” Wesser said. “For example, on a $440,000 home — the U.S. national average in July 2024 — a ¼ point drop in a 30-year mortgage yields a monthly savings of about $65 and a long-term savings of about $24,500.”\nBut lower interest rates could mean higher home prices, particularly in what will likely be a sellers’ market.\n“I believe that sellers markets — where there is a lack of homes for sale — are finally reaching a breaking point, and will be selling in the fourth of this year more frequently,” DiBugnara said. “This is being caused by higher dead loads, increased equity in their homes and less cash in their bank accounts. All this will most likely lead to an increase in prices post-election.”\nSome may feel more comfortable waiting to buy a home until we’re past the election, but they may miss out on opportunities.\n“While lower interest rates are anticipated in September, which could attract more buyers, the current low inventory may lead to bidding wars,” Grandelli said. “This increased competition could put buyers at a disadvantage.”\nUltimately there are reasons to both wait and not wait to buy a home after election time.\n“Many people think it’s best to wait until after in case there is some kind of crash or ripple effect caused by change that leads to prices being lower,” said Seamus Nally, the CEO of TurboTenant. “Others don’t think that’s going to happen, and instead believe it’s better to buy before because election times cause uncertainty, and uncertainty leads to people spending less money. Basically, that means that there may be less buyers on the market before an election, which could work out in your favor as a buyer.”\nAt the end of the day, prospective homebuyers have to weigh the pros and cons for nobody but themselves and decide whether they’re comfortable buying a home right now.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n2 Changes Are Coming to Social Security in 2025\n5 Types of Homes That Will Plummet in Value in 2024\nIf You Shop Online, Make Sure You Do This -- It Could Put an Extra $200 in Your Wallet\n6 Strategies Anyone Can Use to Pay Off Debt\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Is It Better To Wait Until After the Election To Buy a Home?

        "article_content": "This story was originally published on PharmaVoice. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily PharmaVoice newsletter. \nAs Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump enter the home stretch of their campaigns, both candidates have been financially supported by an increasingly anxious pharma sector.\nBig Pharma is big into lobbying, and drugmakers upped their efforts in 2024, with more spending compared to the previous year, Politico reported. And there are several key policy issues at stake, including Medicare’s price negotiation power. \nPharma has historically supported Republicans, although that favorability flipped in 2020, with Democrats receiving more support since then, according to public data retrieved from Open Secrets. And Harris has received significantly more contributions from the pharma manufacturing sector — nearly $1.7 million — compared to former president Donald Trump, who cashed in just over $300,000, the data showed.\nIt’s not uncommon for large companies and their leaders in many industries to contribute to both sides of the aisles, and this year’s election is no different, with pharma-related political action committees contributing to Democrats and Republicans in congressional races nearly evenly. Some executives have made individual contributions to their presidential campaign picks, but for the most part, Big Pharma CEOs have taken the PAC approach.\nHere’s where campaign donations from some of pharma’s biggest companies are going. \nIn the first half of the year, Eli Lilly’s PAC — Lilly PAC — gave more than $180,000 to Republicans and Democrats in House and Senate races, as well as equal amounts to both parties’ congressional and senatorial committees. CEO David Ricks also donated the maximum individual contribution to a Republican Congressman Brett Guthrie from Kentucky, as well as two other PACs, including Carolina Victory Fund, which has given 100% of its funding to Democrats and has a large donor base made up of mostly Big Pharma CEOs.\nJ&J CEO Joaquin Duato hasn’t given any individual contributions to politicians this year, according to FEC records, but he has continually donated to the J&J PAC since 2023. The company PAC has given nearly $500,000 in 2023 and 2024 to Democrats and Republicans running for Congress, with the contributions leaning slightly more Republican. In October, J&J PAC contributed more than $26,000 to various candidates, according to the latest FEC records.\nIt’s a similar story at AbbVie, with CEO Robert Michael giving monthly to the company’s PAC, but no individual contributions. The PAC has hedged slightly Democrat in its contributions to congressional races, and like other Big Pharma companies, the PAC hasn’t given to either presidential candidate in the latest round of records.\nRobert Davis, CEO of Merck, has donated to Merck PAC consistently for the past two years and contributed the maximum amount to a handful of Democratic and Republican congressional candidates and their affiliated PACs. Merck PAC has leaned more Republican in its 2024 contributions, however. In its October filing with the FEC, the PAC reported more than $300,000 in disbursements to House and Senate candidates and PACs, including the Senate Republican Campaign Committee.\nAmgen, one of the industry’s largest lobbyists, has contributed significantly more to Republicans in the latest election round, bucking the trend among other Big Pharmas to be more evenly distributed. Amgen PAC has spent 62% of its contributions on Republicans this year, according to public record. \nAmgen CEO Robert Bradway has also given thousands to Republican congressional candidates in the last few months, and organizations that include the National Senate Republican Committee and two Republican-led PACs. However, he also contributed the maximum amount to a Democrat incumbent running for the House in North Carolina this year.\nPfizer PAC has also contributed significantly more to Republicans than Democrats — about 63% compared to 37% for Democrats. However, contributions from Pfizer employees and affiliates have strongly supported Democrats, with more than $200,000 going to Harris compared to less than $12,000 to Trump from individuals, public records show found. Contributions from Amgen’s employees and affiliates also heavily favored Harris — with more than $67,000 for Harris and just over $10,000 for Trump.\nThe CEOs of the Big Pharma companies based outside the U.S. are not allowed to contribute to U.S. election candidates per federal law, but the drugmakers have still used PAC funds — funded by eligible U.S. employees — to build relationships with Democratic and Republican candidates, according to records.\nRoche, based in Switzerland, has a much smaller PAC presence, by comparison. Roche Diagnostics PAC has contributed less than $100,000 total in 2023 and 2024, with a slight lean toward Republican candidates. \nNovartis, also based in Switzerland, has a PAC that has contributed more to Democrats over the last 10 years, though its 2024 contributions have geared slightly more to Republicans.\nDenmark-based Novo Nordisk’s PAC has given more than $300,000 in the 2023-2024 election cycle, with 49% of funds going to Democrats and 51% toward Republicans.\nU.K.’s AstraZeneca also has a PAC that slightly favored Republicans in this election, though the amount it contributed to the party has declined for the last several years, with 2024 being the lowest level of contribution in 20 years, according to public record."

        "article_content": "A few days ago, we discussed several stocks that could benefit from a Biden economic boom if he wins reelection in 2024. However, today I want to consider an alternative scenario – a triumph from former president Donald Trump. Given Trump’s resurgence in recent polls, I believe this outcome may be more probable than many think.\nWhile the Biden administration has overseen a robust economic recovery from the pandemic, many middle- and working-class families continue to struggle with inflation and rising costs of living. Recent foreign policy challenges have also dragged down Biden’s approval ratings, raising electability concerns given his age. With less than a year until the 2024 election, the race remains fluid. But if you think Trump could pull off a comeback victory, certain stocks are worth considering. Let’s dive in!\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) is a company developing technology and weapons products for military, law enforcement, and civilian use. Indeed, I think this is among the bestl-positioned companies to benefit from Trump’s policies, should he triumph in 2024.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nTrump has repeatedly vowed to crack down on crime, secure the southern border, and support domestic police departments. He is also likely to increase military spending substantially. This all bodes very well with respect to demand growth for Axon’s suite of body cameras, digital evidence management platforms, and non-lethal weapons.\nRecently, Axon made a savvy move to acquire Fusus, providing real-time operations software to grow the company’s total addressable market by $20 billion. The new Axon Body Workforce product line also cleverly expands Axon’s reach into commercial sectors like retail and healthcare. Under a second Trump term, I would expect significant tailwinds for both Axon’s public sector and private sector business segments.\nThe company is already executing tremendously well. Axon’s Q3 sales grew 33% and its profitability is stellar. Thus, I believe AXON stock deserves the premium it trades at, given its prospective growth prospects.\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nBaker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) is poised to benefit immensely from a Trump-led ‘America First’ agenda in the Oval Office.\nTrump has repeatedly promised to unleash America’s “drill, baby, drill” energy production potential. He is likely to reduce regulations substantially for domestic oil and gas producers, while expediting LNG export projects globally. This should translate into a surge of new business for Baker Hughes.\nWhile BKR stock has struggled amid concerns over a growth slowdown, a second Trump term could profoundly change the company’s trajectory. In the company’s core Oil Field Services and Equipment segment, Baker Hughes still managed to grow 2023 revenues by 16%, while growing its operating margins by an impressive 80 basis points.\nThus, Baker Hughes’ outlook remains cautiously optimistic. Under a Trump administration (likely unwilling to beg OPEC for more oil abroad but rather maximize our domestic production), Baker Hughes is sure to see accelerating order growth both onshore and offshore. Its LNG capabilities will also be in high demand. Trading at a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 14-times, Baker Hughes seems like a value stock ready to erupt. If Trump brings a driller’s mentality back to the White House, few companies offer more upside than Baker Hughes right now.\nSource: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\nAs one of the largest and most influential global banks, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) should perform well no matter who occupies the Oval Office. But a Trump triumph in 2024 could provide particularly positive catalysts for the mega bank.\nWhile Trump has a small personal stake in JPMorgan, this is unlikely to impact policy decisions much. Far more important is his preference for bilateral trade deals, reduced regulations, and historically low interest rates to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates actually tend to reduce bank profitability by compressing net interest margin, but can improve the debt service capacity of its customers, so it’s a double-edged sword.\nHowever, I expect a surge in lending activity under Trump’s economic vision. This revenue growth could more than offset any margin deterioration for well-run banks like JPMorgan. Trump is also likely to be less-inclined to impose restrictive regulations on banks than his predecessors. And if an unlikely systemic crisis did threaten major banks, Trump has signaled a willingness to have the Federal Reserve intervene aggressively, as it did back in 2020.\nWith its diversified business mix spanning commercial and investment banking, asset management, and other segments, JPMorgan remains an indispensable pillar of the global financial system. While Trump’s views on interest rates concern some bank investors, I believe easing regulations and deal-making will outweigh pressures on net interest margins.\nJPMorgan survived the Great Recession intact and entered the current robust economy in a position of strength. Betting against this financial powerhouse seems unwise, regardless of 2024’s electoral outcome.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nA right-leaning video platform competing with the likes of YouTube, Rumble (NASDAQ:RUM) has seen tremendous growth since Trump joined the platform after post-bans from other mainstream social media sites. The company’s stock price reflects enthusiasm around another Trump presidential term, surging 75% year-to-date.\nIf Trump wins again, Rumble should continue benefiting from expanded brand awareness and user growth as it becomes the go-to video site for conservative voices. Trump would also likely pursue policies aimed at limiting the power of other big tech companies, creating an opening for Rumble to gain market share. While profitability remains elusive for now, Rumble’s revenue growth rate has remained at triple-digit levels, as user engagement booms.\nWith $267 million in cash and almost no debt, Rumble has years of runway to grow into its valuation. I’ll admit the company’s current valuation gives me a little vertigo. But in a scenario where Trump returns and his supporters flock to Rumble en masse heading into the 2024 election, speculative upside still exists here. This could become the platform of choice for an entire political movement.\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\nAs an offshore driller operating specialized modern jack-up rigs, Borr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) would find smooth sailing under a second Trump term. With Trump promising to unleash domestic oil production, roll back regulations, and rehabilitate the wider fossil fuel industry, offshore drilling companies like Borr should have ample growth opportunities.\nThe company’s utilization rates already stand at 94% with full order books, as offshore drilling capacity remains scarce. Additionally, Borr has locked in future contracts at highly-favorable day rates as well, with upward rate momentum seeming likely to persist. Even if rates plateau, Borr is set to generate over $500 million of 2024 EBITDA, allowing for rapid de-leveraging and a continuation of capital return to shareholders. Notably, Borr also secured $82 million for three additional jack-up rigs, signaling more growth could be on the horizon.\nThat said, BORR stock trades at just 8-times 2024 estimated earnings, while analysts forecast ~30% revenue growth ahead. That’s too cheap for a quality name like this.\nSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com\nAnother premier offshore driller, Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) seems certain to prosper under a Trump administration bullish on resurrecting domestic oil production in unapologetic fashion.\nImportantly, Seadrill just won $1.1 billion in new contracts from a Brazilian giant. It’s certainly not a leap to suggest that a president promising to greenlight drilling permitting could bring a gusher of new business domestically, too.\nWith the company’s earnings per share expected to recover from its decline in the years ahead, a Trump win provides added catalysts for Seadrill. The offshore industry desperately needs drilling capacity, and Seadrill now has a clean balance sheet (and substantial share buybacks) to entice investors to continue to put capital to work in this name.\nTrading at bargain multiples relative to its potential earnings power, SDRL stock should regain its former glory if Trump throws his full weight behind offshore production. For shareholders willing to stomach commodity volatility, I believe Seadrill offers elite risk/reward here.\nSource: Ford\nAs an iconic American automaker, Ford (NYSE:F) seems poised for a comeback under a Trump presidency. Trump’s policies are likely to be much less hostile to internal combustion engine makers, focused more on improving the range of consumer choices on the market.\nRather than subsidizing EVs at the expense of traditional autos, Trump would likely let the market determine winning technologies. This levels the playing field for Ford to better compete with pure-play EV makers.\nFord’s core operations are strengthening too – its remarkable recovery since January suggests the UAW scandal is fading while momentum builds. With long-term earnings per share growth expected, Ford’s stock price appears to be severely undervalued at current levels.\nFord’s management team is already reassessing its aggressive EV push to avoid overextending the company’s balance sheet. I think this is a prudent move, and could be a timely one, if Trump wins the White House again. While EVs and hybrids remain critical to Ford’s future, Trump’s friendlier stance toward gas-powered vehicles should ease pressure on the company to abandon their EV ambitions entirely. That’s good for the company, and for the environment as well (one could argue).\nTrading at just 7-times 2024 earnings with positive catalysts mounting, Ford seems ready to rev up and regain glory. Its proud legacy deserves preservation, and President Trump’s industry-agnostic policy preference could fuel a Ford comeback.\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

One of these issues, for instance, is around electric vehicles (EVs).\nCheck Out: Car Experts Recommend These 9 Used German Cars for Maximum Reliability and Longevity\nRead Next: 6 Subtly Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\n“If Kamala Harris becomes president, there is a high likelihood that she will push for stricter emissions regulations and incentives for electric vehicle adoption,” said Michael Collins, CFA, founder, CEO, WinCap Financial. “Therefore, investing in an electric car now would not only align with her potential policies but also help save money in the long run on fuel costs.”\nIn addition, some experts said that regardless of the next administration, there will be continued growth in the electric vehicle market, supported by the unprecedented funding into the electrification sector.\n“We continue to see automakers launching more and improving vehicle options and capabilities, which are attracting a wider range of consumers to the EV market,” said Rue Phillips, co-founder and president, SkillFusion.\nWhat’s more, Phillips noted that the nation’s charging network continues to grow and improve every quarter to support drivers.\n“This is causing incredible economic opportunity for the country and new careers for those interested in being a part of the EV revolution,” added Phillips.\nHere is a look at cars to buy now if you think Harris will win.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nAndrew Latham, CFP, managing editor, Supermoney.com, said that while he doesn’t recommend choosing cars based on who wins elections, if you’re going to base your decision on that, one worth considering is the Tesla Model 3.\nHe added that the Tesla Model 3, built in the U.S., might qualify for more tax benefits- credits which are part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These credits are up to $7,500 under certain circumstances.\nThis car could also qualify for more tax credits, as it is also built in the U.S. – and hence makes it a good option under a potential Harris administration due to its alignment with green policies and potential incentives, said Latham.\nIf Harris becomes president, she may push for incentives or tax breaks for purchasing eco-friendly cars, making the already affordable Toyota Prius even more attractive to buyers, according to WinCap’s Collins.\n“Its efficient fuel economy and low emissions combined with the longevity people have come to expect from Toyotas also make it a practical choice for daily commuting,” he added.\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV is another electric car option that may see increased demand under a Harris presidency, said Collins.\n“This compact hatchback offers over 250 miles of range on a single charge and has earned praise for its spacious interior and responsive driving experience,” he said, adding that as Harris has expressed support for expanding electric vehicle infrastructure, the Bolt EV could be a popular choice among her supporters looking to make the switch to greener transportation.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "It appears as if some people were surprised to see that President Joe Biden wasn’t on the ballot this year.\nAccording to Google Trends, search results for “did Joe Biden drop out” have peaked this week, and are spiking on Election Day, even though the president had dropped out of the 2024 race this summer and endorsed the current Democratic Party nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.\nOn July 21, Biden shared a letter announcing he would no longer be running for president, although it was originally his “intention to seek reelection” in 2024.\n“I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote.\nThe same day that Biden announced he’d no longer be running for president, he also endorsed Harris for the ticket.\n“Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,” he said in another post on X. “Democrats—it’s time to come together and beat Trump.”\nThe announcement came soon after a presidential debate performance in late June that many saw equally uninspiring and troubling, and led to subsequent questions about Biden’s mental fitness and ability to defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump. Even many of his supporters, donors, and fellow Democratic lawmakers called for the 81-year-old president to concede the candidacy after the debate.\n“A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races,\" Biden told CBS News. “When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition President. I can't even say how old I am; it's hard for me to get it out of my mouth.”\nWhile it’s been months since Biden officially dropped out of the race, apparently there are still Americans who don't know who’s running for president.\n“Imagine being a voter who just today found out Joe Biden isn’t running,” Armand Domalewski, a data scientist and cofounder of YIMBYs for Harris, posted on X Tuesday.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-12-02T08:18:35.000Z",
        "article_content": "Bitcoin has surged by 129% in 2024, driven by the April halving event and the U.S. Presidential election. ICO Analytics data shows Bitcoin gained 37% in November alone, making it one of its strongest Novembers. Only three years—2013 with a 459% increase, 2017 with 54%, and 2020 with 42%—saw higher November gains. Historically, Bitcoin prices tend to climb about six months after a halving event, aligning with the current market trend.\nDespite its strong performance, Bitcoin has faced challenges in reaching the $100,000 milestone. On Nov. 22, its price briefly touched $99,000 before retreating to the $96,000-$98,000 range. However, Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) crossed $100,200 twice in a week, sparking speculation about an imminent spot price increase. As of Nov. 30, Bitcoin dominance fell to 56.1%, a sign that investors are rotating profits into altcoins, possibly marking the start of an altcoin season.\nAccording to CryptQuant, less than 2.5 million Bitcoin remain available on exchanges, emphasizing its scarcity. Analysts are optimistic about further price increases. Raoul Pal, CEO of Global Macro Investor, predicts a local top of $110,000 by January 2025 and a larger peak later in the year. Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow has suggested that reaching $100,000 could ignite the \"Omega Candle,\" a rapid price surge potentially adding $10,000 daily, driven by heightened demand from traders, institutions, and even governments. Mow speculates this could push Bitcoin’s value to $1 million or higher.\nThe cryptocurrency's year-to-date performance aligns with its historical patterns during halving years, where reduced mining rewards contribute to supply scarcity and rising demand. November’s gain further solidifies Bitcoin's reputation as a resilient digital asset with a growing appeal among both institutional and retail investors. Market watchers closely monitor its next move as it fluctuates around $97,544.56.\nBitcoin’s price action has also highlighted its role in the broader market. The reduced supply, increased adoption by institutions, and continued interest from retail investors underline its significance as a scarce, decentralized asset. The market is now eyeing whether the cryptocurrency can sustain its momentum to achieve new highs, while altcoins appear poised to benefit from Bitcoin’s recent dominance decline.\nThis year’s halving and the global economic backdrop have reinforced Bitcoin’s status as a critical player in the evolving financial landscape, making its journey toward potential milestones a focal point for traders and analysts alike."

        "article_content": "The 2024 election is quickly approaching and investors are watching it with a close eye. After all, the outcome could potentially affect the stock market and that’s their bread and butter. If you have money in stocks and are curious about which way the wind is going to blow, we have some answers. GOBankingRates spoke with investors to find out what they’re thinking when it comes to the new occupant of the White House – specifically their concerns.\nHere’s why investors are concerned about their stocks if Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election.\nCheck Out: Mark Cuban and Many Other Venture Capitalists Are Supporting Harris for President — Here’s Why\nRead Next: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nThe stock market has shown remarkable resilience over the years, regardless of who’s in the Oval Office. As Brandon Galici, CFP and founder of Galici Financial, pointed out, “The stock market has historically trended upward, regardless of party affiliation. Whether a Democrat or Republican occupies the White House, the long-term trend of the stock market has been positive. This is because numerous factors beyond presidential control influence market performance.”\nOne of Harris’ key proposals is increasing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. While this might sound alarming to some investors, Anthony DeLuca, CFP and expert from Annuity.org, had some thoughts: “At a time where we need inflation to remain level for the Federal Reserve Board to cut the federal funds rate starting in September and through 2025, raising taxes and more government spending is not the answer.”\nHowever, DeLuca also shared that Harris plans to “forgive student loans, offer a child tax credit, cap landlord rates, reduce down payments on homes and cut price gouging on companies who earn over a certain revenue.” These measures would put more money in Americans’ pockets, potentially boosting the economy.\nSee More: I’m an Investor: I’m Making These Money Moves Immediately If Trump Wins\nHarris will most likely continue some of the tariff policies implemented by previous administrations. While the idea is to boost domestic production, these policies might have mixed effects on the market. DeLuca explained, “Imported goods are cheaper and help with the trendline [of reducing inflation].” Specifically, investors are keeping an eye on how Harris navigates international trade relationships.\nWhile a Harris victory could bring some changes to the economic landscape, the fundamentals of smart investing remain the same. Diversification, long-term thinking and staying informed about both policy changes and broader economic trends will be key.\nAs Craig Goodliffe, CEO and founder of Cyberbacker, shared, “Voting for Harris means we’re probably going to see a really strong economy because she’s making sure that businesses bear most of the tax burden and alleviate it from the middle class. This is going to put a lot more money in the average person’s pocket.”\nOf course, the most important thing is to remember that while elections might cause short-term market volatility, they’re just one small factor in the very complicated word of investing. Speak to experts, keep your eye on the market and gauge your own relationship to risk when determining your next moves.\nAs Galici pointed out, “Making dramatic changes to your investment strategy solely because of who wins the presidency is not a wise move. Your financial plan should be robust enough to weather various political scenarios.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Cars To Stay Away From In Retirement\n5 Things You Should Stop Wasting Money on if Kamala Harris Wins in November, According to Experts\nHere's How To Become a Real Estate Investor for Just $1K Using This Bezos-Backed Startup\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I’m an Investor: 2 Reasons I’m Concerned About My Stocks If Harris Wins the 2024 Election"

        "article_content": "The U.S. presidential election is barreling towards us. Many are eager and nervous to find out who will be the next commander-in-chief in a race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\nEven more are biting their nails with worry or anticipation for what could happen to the domestic and global markets around the world.\nRead Next: I’m a Retirement Planner — 4 Moves You Should Make If You Think Trump Will Win the 2024 Election\nLearn More: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nGOBankingRates reached out to a few financial experts to see what the average investor should consider doing ahead of the results. Here are four money moves to make the week before the election, according to experts.\nTrending Now:\nBoomers Have the Wealth--Why Are Thousands Still Homeless?\nSuze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\n“If you’re looking to protect yourself and maybe even make some money before the election, here’s what I’d tell you. First, raise some cash,” said financial expert David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX, an automated trading platform.\n“If you’ve got stocks that have run up, take some profits. Cash gives you flexibility. If the market dips after the election, you’ll be ready to jump on some bargains,” he advised.\nCheck Out: 5 Things You Should Stop Wasting Money on if Kamala Harris Wins in November, According to Experts\n“Think about companies that sell things people need no matter what: Groceries, electricity, healthcare,” Materazzi said. “These stocks might not make you rich overnight, but they’ll hold up if the market gets… shaky.”\nMaterazzi also suggested investors stick with dividend-paying stocks.\n“When the market’s uncertain dividends provide a steady cash flow,” he said. “You get paid even if the stock price bounces around. Look for companies with a strong history of paying dividends.”\nInvestors should establish what is called an investment policy statement (IPS) and follow it, according to Robert R. Johnson, PhD, CFA, CAIA, and professor of finance at Heider College of Business at Creighton University.\n“All investors should avail themselves of the services of a credentialed financial advisor who operates as a fiduciary,” said Johnson, noting how investing without a plan is like driving without a roadmap or GPS.\n“Investors should not concern themselves with broad market moves or the crisis du jour,” he explained. “An IPS is a written document that clearly sets out a client’s return objectives and risk tolerance over that client’s relevant time horizon, along with applicable constraints such as liquidity needs and tax circumstances. In essence, an IPS sets out the ground rules of the investment process — it is the document that guides the investment plan.\nThe expert concluded, “Investors should take a long term approach and stay the course. Take a page from the late Jack Bogle, Vanguard founder, who said, ‘The wise investor knows that market timing is futile, and the only way to achieve consistent results is through a disciplined and patient approach.'”\n“Think long-term: the election is just one event,” offered Materazzi. “Great companies keep growing no matter who is in office. If the market drops, that’s a chance to buy good stocks at a discount. That’s how you make real money.”\nRobert Persichitte, an affiliate professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, shared this story from 2016.\n“U.S. dollar futures went down any time Trump started moving ahead in the polls. The market signaled that a Trump presidency would hurt international businesses,” he said. “When we learned about Trump’s surprise victory over Clinton, stock futures were tumbling, and we had an emergency meeting to talk about how to respond to panicky calls about the declining stock market.\n“To everyone’s surprise, the stock market opened to huge gains. From the night before, we had signals up and down and a surprise reaction the day after the election.”\n“Bottom line is that investors should not change course with a major election coming up,” agreed Johnson. “There does exist a presidential term effect, and returns have been historically highest in the year of a presidential election.”\n“Don’t get caught up in speculation — avoid making wild bets based on what you think might happen,” cautioned Materazzi. “The market’s unpredictable… especially around elections. Stick with solid businesses you understand.”\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul has reported: Trump's main campaign promises — a new wave of tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants — could put new upward pressure on prices, many economists say.\nThat sentiment played out in markets and Wall Street's Fed forecasts on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) spiked as much as 17 basis points to hit 4.46%. The move extended a recent surge in Treasurys as economic growth data has largely come in better than expected since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18.\nMarkets have now moved from seeing nearly eight cuts when the Fed first cut rates back in September to now pricing in about four cuts through the end of next year.\nWells Fargo chief economist Jay Bryson had projected seven interest rate cuts from the Fed over the next year.

Big banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), and Morgan Stanley (MS) were all up between 7% and 11%.\nMeanwhile, companies with pending acquisitions caught bids, as seen by the more than 17% rise in Discover Financials (DFS) stock, which is currently in agreement to be acquired by Capital One (COF).\nRead more on other Trump trades taking place today here.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) stock tanked as much as 27% Wednesday before paring losses.\nShares of the AI server maker, which is a customer of Nvidia (NVDA), tumbled 24% to trade above $20 midday.\nThe drop extends Tuesday's losses after Super Micro earnings missed estimates. The company also said it couldn't predict when it would file its delayed 10-K report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe stock, which thrived earlier this year thanks to the artificial intelligence boom, has been under pressure since a report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research in August revealed alleged accounting violations at the company. Shares tanked further when the Wall Street Journal reported in September that the company was being investigated by the Department of Justice. They plunged again on Oct. 30 when Super Micro's accounting firm Ernst & Young, which was conducting its audit, resigned. Super Micro is now at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq (^IXIC).\nMajor US-listed Chinese stocks sank after a decisive US election win for Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump, who has promised to impose a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.\nShares of US-listed Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) fell as much as 4.5% while JD.com (JD) dropped as much as 7.7%, Bilibili (BILI) stock fell up to 7.8%, Baidu (BIDU) sank as much as 2.9%, and PDD Holdings (PDD) tumbled up to 5.1%. The stocks pared losses as the morning continued.\nTrump's trade plan would implement tariffs at levels unseen since the Great Depression, which would raise basic costs for US households and hit GDP growth.\nRead the full story here. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring mortgage rates down. It may not necessarily work out that way.\n\"Trump’s fiscal policies can be expected to lead to rising and more unpredictable mortgage rates through the end of this year and into 2025,\" Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant wrote in an email Wednesday. \"Signals of higher mortgage rates are already out there in the form of rising yields on the 10-year Treasury this morning.\"\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury spiked early Wednesday to 4.45%. Mortgage rates usually move in conjunction with the 10-year yield as lenders determine their daily rates with movements in the bond market.\nSturtevant added, \"Bond yields are rising because investors expect Trump’s proposed fiscal policies to widen the federal deficit and reverse progress on inflation.\"\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal survey conducted in early October, most economists predicted inflation, interest rates and deficits would be higher in a Trump administration versus a Kamala Harris administration.\nTrump's victory comes as the housing market has remained out of reach for many Americans over the past few years, driven by record-high home prices, elevated mortgage rates, and an undersupply of homes.\nOil slid as much as 2% on Wednesday before flipping into green territory as the US dollar rose and traders weighed what Donald Trump's presidential victory means for demand and supply going forward.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered around $72 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $75 per barrel.\nEarlier in the session, the US Dollar Index saw its biggest jump since 2016. Analysts highlighted Trump's promise to end the Ukraine-Russia war and his counsel to Israel to wind down the Gaza conflict quickly.\n\"Crude futures being pressured by the 'Trump Trade' this morning as a sharply higher US Dollar Index and the prospects of deescalation in both the Middle East and Ukraine is taking the Geopolitical fear factor out of crude,\" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote on Wednesday morning.\nThe possibility of more tariffs also weighed on prices earlier in the session.\n\"Tariffs may ultimately impact trade between the USA and China, negatively affecting the Chinese economy and the growth in oil demand,\" Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\nIn early trading action, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped about 2.8%, or more than 1,200 points, to lead the gains. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 1.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 1.8%.\nMeanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT), which includes some regional banks, soared more than 4.2% at the open. The small-cap index was partially driven by a rally in banks. Trump's policy proposals have been viewed by some experts as more positive for the financials sector, spurring a massive rally in regional banks before the open on Wednesday. The S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) was up more than 10%.\nAmid a broad market rally Wednesday morning, bank stocks were among the best performers. Investors see Donald Trump's win in the presidential race as ushering in a \"new era\" for regulating the nation's biggest financial institutions.\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith notes: \"Big banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), and Morgan Stanley (MS) are all up between 7% and 11% in premarket trading Wednesday morning.\"\nBank stocks have been strong performers for much of this year, with most of the large money center banks seeing their shares outperform the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2024.\nAs David reports, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said in a note early Wednesday that Trump's win \"should aid all banks.\" Mayo added that the win ushers in a \"new era after 15 years of harsher regulation\" following the financial crisis.\nRead more from David on what could be one of the most impactful Trump trades for investors and consumers alike during the next administration.\nHere's a look at the big economic and market themes happening today as Wall Street digests Donald Trump's rise back to the White House.\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, (the week ended Nov. 1); S&P Global US services PMI, (October final); S&P Global US composite PMI, (October final)\nEarnings: Arm Holdings (ARM), AMC (AMC), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Celsius Holdings (CELH), CVS (CVS), Elf (ELF), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM)\nHere are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning:\nAs Trump wins, here's what's next on 2 key economic issues\nBitcoin hits record as pro-crypto Trump wins presidency again\nTesla shares pop\nDJT stock rockets higher\nOil tumbles as Trump trades boost the dollar\nGold falls amid Trump's decisive win\nDollar hits 1-year high\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) surged to a fresh record high overnight as Donald Trump, the candidate viewed as the most pro-cryptocurrency, emerged as the president-elect.\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency surged above $74,000 per coin for the first time ever late Tuesday night. But it's not just actual crypto coins moving higher.\nMicroStrategy (MSTR), which holds a significant amount of bitcoin on its balance sheet, rose more than 11% in premarket trade. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) also gained more than 12%, while Robinhood (HOOD), which offers cryptocurrency trading on its platform, popped almost 10%.\nTesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 12% in premarket trading on Wednesday morning as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk had been a heavy supporter of Trump's campaign. Trump referenced Musk during his speech early Wednesday morning, calling him a \"super genius.\"\n\"We have to protect our geniuses,\" Trump said. \"We don't have that many of them.\"\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives pointed out that Trump could roll back the current electric vehicle tax incentives in place and be \"an overall negative for the EV industry.\" But given Tesla's potential competitive advantage in the EV space, this could be a \"huge positive\" for Tesla.\n\"Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry, and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years,\" Ives wrote in a Wednesday morning note.\nNio's (NIO) stock fell 6% before the bell, while BYD (BYDDY) shares fell 3.8% in Hong Kong.\nIves added that a Trump win could also fast-track Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) initiatives.\n\"We believe a Trump win could add $40-$50 per share to Tesla's stock and exceed $1 trillion in market cap if autonomous/FSD is accelerated starting in 2025 and a tailwind for Cybercab,\" Ives wrote."

        "date": "2024-09-16T09:03:22.000Z",
        "article_content": "In their bids to win the 2024 election, former President Donald Trump has promised to \"drill, baby, drill\" to lower energy prices, while Vice President Kamala Harris has assured she won’t ban fracking.\nThose promises may not matter much in the near term. Energy prices are poised to drop, regardless of who wins, says one industry watcher.\n“Whoever gets elected in November is going to be very fortunate in that they are going to be dealing with some of the most serious energy deflation ... since 2020,” Tom Kloza, OPIS Global head of energy analysis, told Yahoo Finance, referring to the start of the pandemic lockdowns four years ago when US crude prices slumped as travel demand collapsed.\nThe past week was one of the year's most volatile for the energy markets as oil touched its lowest level since 2021 before ticking higher on Wednesday. Year to date, West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) is down about 2%, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, is down more than 4%.\nGasoline prices have also fallen to their lowest level since February, with the national average at $3.24 per gallon, according to AAA.\nPrices are expected to go lower as the industry soon switches to a cheaper winter-grade gasoline. Analysts predict the national average will dip below $3 per gallon in the coming weeks barring an unforeseen event.\n\"These sub-$3 prices are sure to boost consumer sentiment going into the fall,” GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan told Yahoo Finance.\nRead more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts\nWeak demand out of China, the biggest importer of oil, has been the main driver of declining crude prices. The country has been battling a housing crisis while shifting toward electric vehicles and more natural gas consumption.\nCracks in the US economy and in Europe have also weighed on the markets, keeping some speculators notably at bay.\n“What happened this summer and what continues to happen is that you do not have speculators buying futures and options contracts anymore,” said Kloza. “The fact that we didn’t see more speculative money coming into the market … that might represent a real sea change for oil.”\n\"Right now, financial participation in oil markets is probably as low as it’s been since oil became an asset class,” said Kloza.\nThe fall in oil prices has been so rapid that Wall Street analysts have been forced to revise their forecasts. On Monday, Morgan Stanley cut its Brent price target for the second time in a matter of weeks, citing risks of \"considerable demand weakness.\"\nThe analysts forecast Brent will average $75 per barrel in the fourth quarter of this year, $5 lower than the prior downwardly revised outlook of $80 issued in late August.\nOil demand growth forecasts have also come down. The International Energy Agency cut its outlook for 2024, citing Chinese oil demand \"firmly in contraction.\"\nThe revision came the same week oil alliance OPEC slightly trimmed its own oil demand forecast. Despite the revision, OPEC's expectations are still near double other industry estimates.\nThe oil alliance spearheaded by Saudi Arabia has been eager to bring back more of its supply by unwinding some of its production cuts, which have helped keep a floor on prices.\nHowever, the cartel recently delayed the reintroduction of barrels initially slated for October given the slump in oil. The postponement didn’t do much to boost prices.\n“OPEC+ still has a significant amount of oil that is just waiting to return to the market. And I think that’s the concern — is there really that demand to really satisfy and absorb that increased oil that is going to come back to the market sometime soon?” Tortoise senior portfolio manager Rob Thummel told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\nIn a nod to centrists during Tuesday's event, Harris underscored record production in the US, the largest oil and gas producer in the world.\n\"We have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels,\" said Harris.\nMeanwhile, at rallies, Trump has promised to produce even more oil in order to cut energy prices in half and bring gasoline below $2 per gallon, though analysts expect producers to keep his \"drill, baby, drill\" vow in check if prices go too low.\nOn average, companies need the price of US crude to be at least $64 per barrel in order to profitably drill a new well and $39 for existing ones, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve survey.\nWith WTI trading near $69, production is expected to continue growing amid technological breakthroughs. The US reached peak production last year despite declining US drilling activity because new wells are more efficient, according to government data. US oil production next year is expected to reach another record level, given advances in horizontal drilling and fracking.\n\"Ukraine war, the COVID lockdowns, those are the things that shaped oil prices in the last four years,\" said OPIS's Kloza.\n\"The more likely thing is that we’re going to see much more modest prices next year, and we'll see oil trade in [on] a lot quieter terms than we have for the last three years,\" he added.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-07-21T18:55:24.000Z",
        "article_content": "President Joe Biden ended his presidential campaign Sunday after a politically disastrous debate performance ignited lingering voter and party concerns about whether the 81-year-old was capable of serving a second term in office.\nThe president announced his decision in a letter posted to his campaign's X, formerly Twitter, account. Biden said he would fulfill his duties as president until his term ends in January and said he would speak to the nation \"later this week in more detail about my decision.\"\nHe also endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, in a follow-up message. \"I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\" he said.\nThe president is currently in Delaware, isolating as he recovers from COVID-19. A letter from his doctor early Sunday said his symptoms had \"improved significantly.\"\nThe move came less than four weeks after the debate and was an acknowledgment of political reality after a steady drumbeat of Biden allies pushed the president publicly and privately to leave the race.\nLawmakers like Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi led the pressure campaign but she was joined by an array of financial world figures who eventually helped force the president to step aside with the threat of withholding future donations.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also reportedly pressed Biden to step aside in recent days. On Sunday, he reacted in a glowing statement toward Biden, saying that while his decision was \"not easy,\" he \"once again put his country, his party, and our future first.\"\nOne of the most prominent donor voices in recent weeks was George Clooney. The actor has helped raise millions for Biden but wrote in a New York Times essay he has witnessed Biden’s decline. The president, he added, isn’t \"even the Joe Biden of 2020.\"\nYet for weeks, Biden and his allies tried to weather the storm.\nAs recently as Monday, in an interview with NBC News, Biden insisted nothing had changed and he was staying in the race “because the job’s not finished.”\nBut then in a BET interview that aired Wednesday, Biden acknowledged that he would consider withdrawing “if I had some medical condition that emerged.” Later Wednesday, the White House announced Biden had tested positive for COVID-19 and he traveled to Delaware to self-isolate.\nOver a dozen notable political figures joined the chorus in recent days asking Biden to step aside as the standoff between the president and his party reached a climax.\nRep. Adam Schiff, who is expected to become California’s next senator and is a close ally of Pelosi, told the Los Angeles Times, “I have serious concerns about whether the president can defeat Donald Trump in November.”\nSen. Jon Tester, who is locked in a tight reelection campaign in his home state of Montana, also called on Biden to step aside on Thursday. Influential Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and many others followed with their own calls on Friday.\nThe president’s move immediately puts the 2024 election into historic territory. Vice President Harris is the clear frontrunner with Biden's endorsement, but others could jockey to replace the president as the party’s standard bearer with Biden's delegates now released.\nPolitical and financial observers began making lists of potential replacements almost immediately after Biden’s meandering debate performance saw him lose his train of thought on the debate stage and meander from topic to topic in a way that crystallized months of growing voter concerns about his fitness for office.\nOther figures viewed as potential candidates are prominent Democratic governors like Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Gavin Newsom of California.\n“If there is another candidate, can that candidate make it a conversation about Trump and a conversation about how unfavorable he has been?” asked Raymond James Washington policy analyst and managing director Ed Mills in a live interview with Yahoo Finance Friday as the pressure neared a crescendo.\nIt’s a process that all sides expect will be messy and fast-moving, with the potential to rattle markets and the political world in the weeks ahead.\nA selection process may need to begin immediately — perhaps even before the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago on Aug. 19. That’s because of a new law in Ohio that requires political parties to certify the presidential ticket by Aug. 7.\nThen, whoever Democrats select will have to quickly take up Biden’s mantle and face off against former President Donald Trump in an election that begins in September when early voting gets underway and continues through Election Day on Nov. 5.\nThey will also face a difficult fundraising task after a flurry of donations to Trump in recent months saw the Republican erase an early lead for Democrats in the money race.\nBiden’s replacement will also have to quickly formulate her or his own case on economic issues.\nThe new candidate will face a challenge in taking up Biden’s mantle on the economy and formulating a message to sway voters fixated on issues like a 20% rise in prices since Biden took office.\nAt the recent Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Republicans again hammered Biden and the Democrats incessantly over inflation.\nMonday night at the convention was focused on the theme “make America wealthy once again” with speaker after speaker highlighting prices in the grocery store and at the gas pump.\nThis post has been updated with additional context.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-06-28T08:44:22.000Z",
        "article_content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) — As US stocks lock in a solid first half, investors are speculating whether political uncertainty, potential Federal Reserve policy shifts and big tech's market dominance could make the rest of 2024 a tougher slog.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 15% year-to-date thanks to strong corporate earnings, a resilient U.S. economy and enthusiasm over artificial intelligence that powered massive gains in stocks such as chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The index’s steady march upward produced 31 new highs in the first half, the most for first half of any year since 2021.\nThe first half has been \"very much a Nirvana period for stocks,\" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \"The economy has been stronger than many people anticipated including the Fed.\"\nIf history is any guide, the momentum in U.S. stocks is likely to continue: a positive first half has been followed by additional gains in the rest of the year 86% of the time, according to a CFRA study of markets during election years since 1944.\nBut the ride could get bumpy. Political uncertainty is likely to be a more powerful factor on asset prices, as investors focus on the U.S. presidential election. A recent JPMorgan survey showed investors see political risk in the U.S. and abroad as the top potential destabilizing factor for stocks.\nInvestors have also become increasingly concerned about the narrowness of the market’s advance, which has been concentrated in a handful of tech powerhouses. Nvidia alone - whose shares are up 150% this year - has accounted for about a third of the S&P 500's total return, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nAnother key uncertainty is whether the economy can maintain the balance of gradually cooling inflation and resilient growth that has fueled investor confidence. A sharp deviation from that so-called Goldilocks scenario could upend the Fed’s plans to cut rates later this year.\n\"With a wide range of potential macro outcomes in 2025, partly due to the U.S. election result, market volatility is likely to increase,\" wrote Jason Draho, head of asset allocation, Americas, for UBS Global Wealth Management.\n Political uncertainty\nWhile investors have mostly been focused on factors such as earnings and monetary policy this year, politics are expected to loom larger as the matchup between President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Republican challenger and former president Donald Trump intensifies in the coming months.\nFutures tied to the Cboe Volatility Index reflect increased demand for protection against equity gyrations around the November vote, as polls continue to show the candidates neck and neck.\nSigns that one of the candidates is gaining the upper hand could ripple out into asset markets. For many, it comes down to divergent tax policies: a Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress could mean the party would have a freer hand to raise taxes, generally seen as a negative for equities, according to UBS Global Wealth Management.\nThe first live debate of the 2024 election race late Thursday spurred a rise in U.S. stocks futures and the dollar, in a move some investors interpreted as a reaction to a strong showing by Trump.\nOne potential wildcard, according to strategists at Janus Henderson, is a contested or prolonged election.\n\"Any commentary suggesting it's a real threat could create bouts of volatility in the coming months, and that volatility would likely continue until a victor is announced,\" they wrote.\nConcentration \nAI-fever and strong earnings have helped drive up equities in the first half, but gains have been concentrated in tech and growth stocks, including Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN).\nThe equal weight S&P 500 index - a proxy for the average stock - is up just 4% for the year, a fraction of the S&P 500’s gain.\nMany investors believe big tech dominance is well deserved, given strong balance sheets and leading positions at the top of their industries. But their growing heft could make markets unstable if the case for holding tech and growth stocks weakens and investors head for the exit all at once.\n\"It's understandable why everyone has drifted to these names, but it's a bit of a game of musical chairs. If the music stops, there's going to be a problem,\" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities.\nMeanwhile, the 12-month forward price to earnings ratio of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has risen to 26 from 20, two years ago, according to LSEG data.\nSome investors are looking to areas of the market that have underperformed in recent months, expecting the rally in tech to spread out into other sectors. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, has been focused on \"quality dividend companies\" and small caps.\n\"We think that perhaps the large cap has run a little too far and that we'll now see perhaps a broadening,\" Ablin said.\nGrowth\nMost investors have cheered signs of cooling inflation and moderating growth this year, as it bolsters the case for the Fed to cut interest rates from a multi-decade peak. But a more pronounced economic slowdown could fuel worries that elevated interest rates are weighing more heavily on the economy.\nFed officials have trimmed their projections to just one rate cut this year from a previous forecast of three, thanks to the economy’s strength and unexpectedly sticky inflation.\nMarket reactions to past rate cutting cycles have largely hinged on whether the cut came during a period of comparatively strong economic performance or in response to a sharp slowdown in growth.\nWhile the S&P 500 has risen by an average of 5.6% in the 12 months after a cycle has begun, cuts that came along with a challenging economic environment coincided with far worse returns, an Allianz study examining rate cuts since the 1980s showed. For example, a rate cutting cycle that kicked off around the collapse of the dotcom bubble in 2000 saw the index down 13.5% a year later.\n\"Every landing is a soft landing until it is not,\" said Julia Hermann, global market strategist at New York Life Investments.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Diane Craft)"

        "article_content": "The ramifications of the US dockworkers strike that began Tuesday could inject uncertainty into the 2024 presidential campaign, create a new sense of unease around the US economy, and be directly felt in key swing states from Georgia to Michigan.\nMuch of the unease hinges on how much — and how long — any effects will be felt now that port workers on the East and Gulf coasts have walked out.\n\"If it lasts for more than a few days or more than a week, you're going to get massive cascading effects,\" Flexport founder and CEO Ryan Petersen said in a recent Yahoo Finance appearance, noting that 15% of the world's container ships could be caught up in a stoppage.\n\"That's a huge reduction in capacity,\" he added.\nBut a prolonged shutdown in Georgia, North Carolina, and in other major ports in the East and Gulf coasts could increase Americans’ sense of economic unease after negotiations stalled over a complex series of wages and automation issues.\nThere are also significant question marks about how Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will approach the strike — with much of the campaign trail focus in recent days on other topics such as the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. The back-and-forth plays into complex politics around unions in the 2024 race amid a concerted effort by Donald Trump to gain labor support.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nEconomic problems could also quickly spread to other parts of the country that will also have a say in the November election, like Michigan, if shipments of autos and auto parts are held up.\nBut shipping experts said that President Joe Biden could be drawn directly into the standoff and be forced to step in to keep workers temporarily on the job.\n\"We strongly suspect that, this close to the election and despite denials ahead of time, President Biden would have little choice but to step in and invoke back-to-work legislation,\" Bradley Saunders of Capital Economics wrote in a recent note.\nSuch a move could trigger an 80-day \"cooling off period\" and largely — but not completely — shelve the issue until after Election Day.\nThe White House said such a move isn't on the table, but it is increasingly being drawn into the standoff.\nLast Friday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, and Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard met with the port operator, the United States Maritime Alliance, to convey a message \"that they need to be at the table and negotiating in good faith fairly and quickly.\"\nThat same message had been delivered to the union, a White House official added.\nPerhaps the key question at the moment — outside of what happens next between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance — is what role the Biden-Harris administration will ultimately play.\nThe White House has taken a wait-and-see approach in recent weeks but has maintained that exercising executive power to delay the strike is not on the table;\n\"We’ve never invoked Taft-Hartley to break a strike and are not considering doing so now,\" a White House official said on Friday, in a reference to a 1947 law that gave the US government more power to intervene in labor disputes.\nChanging course is an option that would risk angering union leaders, but multiple experts say the White House could quickly have little choice.\n\"My base case would be we would get a couple of days in, and I find it difficult to believe that the Biden administration will not invoke the Taft-Hartley Act,\" added Michigan State University supply chain management professor Jason Miller in a recent Yahoo Finance interview.\nBut even if the workers are forced back onto a job without a deal, there is no guarantee that things will operate smoothly in that 80-day interim.\n\"We would expect some slowdowns over that period,\" Miller added.\nPorts from Massachusetts to Texas could be impacted by the strike, but the most in focus politically are those in Savannah, Ga., and Wilmington, N.C., that move significant cargo and sit in key swing states.\nSmaller ports in Brunswick, Ga., as well as Morehead City, N.C., could also be impacted and are already drawing up contingency plans.\nTobin Marcus of Wolfe Research listed the strike as a possible \"October surprise\" in a recent note to clients, adding that it \"could become a major problem for Harris if it drags out.\"\nBut so far, it has largely yet to break through on the campaign trail, even with candidates regularly traveling close to these ports.\nDonald Trump traveled to Savannah last week; he commented on the city's port but didn't weigh in on the labor unrest.\n\"With a world-class port and a world-class workforce, this city will soon become one of the premier export hubs anywhere on earth,\" Trump said as part of his manufacturing pitch.\nLikewise, the Harris campaign and national Democrats have said little about the strike so far.\nBut that could change quickly if disruptions are seen and as Democrats try to convince voters they will be good stewards of the economy. The Oct. 1 start of the strike also has auspicious timing, coming the same day as a vice presidential debate.\nAnother wild card is an ongoing battle for union votes between Harris and Trump, with the former president making a concerted pitch to union workers and leaders to cut into the traditional Democratic strength.\nHarold Daggett, the head of the dockworkers union in the middle of the current talks, has also gotten notice for his aggressive tactics as well as his willingness to invoke politics directly.\n\"Where's the president of the United States? He not fighting for us,\" Daggett said in a recent video.\nHe added of his negotiations with the port operators: \"I'll shut them down to prove that we can beat them.\"\nThis post has been updated.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "It’s no secret that Social Security and Medicare are in financial straits. Or at least they will be relatively soon. According to the Social Security and Medicare Trustees, the Social Security Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund, which pays Social Security benefits to retirees, will run out of money in 2033, and the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund will become insolvent by 2036.\nCheck Out: Trump-Era Tax Cuts Are Expiring — How Changes Will Impact Retirees\nRead Next: 5 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Retirement Savings in 2025\nThe result, as predicted by the U.S. Budget Committee, could be a 21% reduction in Social Security benefits as of 2033 and an 11% cut to Medicare Part A benefits in 2036. Considering inflation and the rising cost of living, that’s not great news to those in the sunset of their careers, and even worse news to younger workers paying into the failing system.\nBut what effect would a second Donald Trump administration have on the Social Security safety net? Would it save it, sink it or change it? We asked Chuck Warren, political economist and host of the Politics Podcast, for his predictions.\nIt's Going Viral: Want to Retire Rich? Suze Orman Says You're Missing This Key Money Move\nPrivatizing Social Security has been a dream for Republicans for more than a decade. Democratic opposition and other factors have stalled these efforts.\nLearn More: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: 4 Reasons You Might Want To Change Your Retirement Plans\nHowever, if Trump rolls into the White House with Republican majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, “one of the most significant changes could be the drive to partly or wholly privatize Social Security,” Warren said. “This, therefore, implies that while higher returns are probable it also comes with market risks and might undermine the income guarantee side of Social Security.”\nMany argue that if nothing is done, benefit reductions are inevitable. So, they say, benefit reductions on certain groups, that can afford them, is the right tactic.\n“Solvency issues could lead to these proposals,” Warren said. For example, gradual benefits reductions especially for richer retirees, including such things as benefit calculation formula changes, he said. “However, while such approaches would prolong the trust funds’ life, [they would] face strong opposition from the public.”\nIf reducing benefits is off the table, then it stands to reason that more revenue will be needed. And that usually means new or higher taxes. One idea that has long been championed by the left is removing the taxable income cap so that higher earners pay more.\nAs of 2024, the 12.4% Social Security tax, which is paid equally (6.2% each) by employer and employee, is only applied on wages up to $168,600. Removing that cap would bring in more revenue by those who could most afford it, while protecting those who can’t.\nBut, said Warren, don’t count on this one. This would “be a major deviation from Trump’s previous tax policies focused on cutting taxes,” he said.\nRather than removing the cap, or in addition to it, another approach is increasing the rate itself.\nSetting the payroll tax rate at 16%, up from 12.4%, would shore up Social Security for 75 years, Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN.\nRepublicans are unlikely to go for that, however, and again, Warren said this goes against Trump’s previous tax policies.\nCurrently, Americans can begin accessing their retirement benefits at age 62 by taking early retirement. This results in a reduced benefit. Full retirement benefits can be taken at age 66 to 67, depending on the person’s date of birth. Increased benefits kick in if individuals wait until age 70.\nBut that could change with a Trump administration, said Warren. “Attempts may be made to increase the age of eligibility for both Social Security and Medicare due to growing life expectancies. However, it could also mean postponement of benefit entitlements for future pensioners who paid their savings into this system over decades.”\nEither way, expect backlash from one group or another.\nIf there is one consistency when it comes to Trump, it’s inconsistency. So, said Warren, predicting precisely what will happen is difficult, but, “given Trump’s first term, as well as Republican preferences on policy, we can expect that there will be attempts to reduce government spending on these programs through a combination of privatization, tax reforms and benefit adjustments,” he said.\n“However, significant changes would need legislative support and face opposition from both sides of the aisle.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Moves For Building Lasting Wealth: What Smart Americans Are Doing Right\n10 Kirkland Clothing Products You Should Buy in October to Maximize Savings\n4 Ways to Talk to Your Partner About Debt\n10 New Cars To Avoid Buying in 2025\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for Social Security If Trump Wins the 2024 Election"

        "article_content": "Insurance giants have a bigger stake in this year’s presidential election after recent moves by the Biden administration cut into the profitability of Medicare Advantage plans.\nIn the last week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) delivered consecutive blows to the industry that offers these private-sector Medicare alternatives, denting insurance stocks and pulling down estimates of future earnings.\nInsurers will get paid less than expected next year for providing these plans, while, at the same time, they must abide by new, and probably costlier, regulations. Other key changes rolling out over the next three years could also nick their bottom lines.\nThe industry expects a second term for President Joe Biden would bring more of the same at a time when the youngest baby boomers become Medicare-eligible and more of the older ones seek healthcare services.\n\"Do I want to say it's a historic level of regulations? If it's not, it's got to be close to it,\" Whit Mayo, an analyst with Leerink Partners, told Yahoo Finance. \"Biden is no friend to the industry right now.\"\nThe new regulations have come hard and fast recently.\nLast week, the government said it would increase its payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) insurers by 3.7% in 2025. That’s \"marginally worse\" than the earlier proposed rate, Mayo said, and “inconsistent with almost any historic precedent.”\nIt also caught the industry by surprise because many expected CMS to incorporate the uptick in healthcare service volumes in the fourth quarter.\nA few days later, CMS finalized other rules around health equity, behavioral healthcare services, and supplemental benefits that would require more action from insurers.\nThe agency also established new rules on how much insurers can compensate a broker selling Medicare Advantage plans to ensure seniors are steered into plans that best meet their needs — not into ones that are most profitable.\n“CMS does not want an agent to have preference over any plan based on commissions…so this is a major change,” Mayo said.\nThese efforts are weighing down insurer stocks.\nYear to date, shares of Humana (HUM) — which has the largest exposure with MA accounts making up 77% of its total revenue — are down 30%.\nThe stock of UnitedHealthcare (UNH) has declined nearly 13% since the beginning of the year. MA accounts make up 31% of UnitedHealthcare's total revenue, according to Ann Hynes, managing director at Mizuho Americas.\nIn a note last week to investors, Hynes estimated the 3.7% increase in the MA payment rate could be a 2% and 4% \"headwind\" for UnitedHealthcare’s 2025 earnings, a 2% to 6% drag on both CVS Healthcare Corp.’s (CVS) and Centene Corp.’s (CNC) profits, and an 8% anchor on Humana’s bottom line.\nOne of the three \"key upcoming catalysts\" for Humana’s stock, Hynes wrote, is “the 2024 Presidential election.”\nMore change is on its way under the Biden administration’s CMS that could also upend insurance profits.\nThe agency recently put out a new patient risk coding model. Each patient receives a risk score based on the number and severity of their health conditions. The unhealthier the patient, the higher the risk score and the more money CMS pays to insurers.\nUnder the new model, risk scores will overall likely decline, meaning fewer dollars will flow to insurers. How much exactly? The model, which will be fully phased in 2025, is expected to save Medicare $11 billion this year, per CMS estimates. Next year, it will likely be more.\nHow Medicare Advantage plans are rated by CMS is also changing.\nCMS ranks each plan annually using a one-to-five-star scale, with five being the best, based on a variety of metrics. The idea is to reward plans that provide quality care with reimbursement and bonuses while cracking down on mediocre plans by reducing CMS payments and restricting their marketing.\nOver the next three years, CMS plans to increase or decrease the weighting of some measures, eliminate others, and add a health equity index to the ranking. Insurers work hard to maintain at least a four-star rating on their plans to get a 5% quality bonus, which, by law, must be invested into plan benefits.\n\"That's what gives you a competitive advantage in the market,\" Mayo said.\nInsurers also remain under pressure from increasingly vocal healthcare providers, which are dropping some Medicare Advantage plans due to too many denials, delays, and refusals to pay for care that Original Medicare would usually cover.\nUnder Donald Trump, those changes may not be carried out.\n\"I think the perception among the investment community is that, under a Trump administration, the environment would be more favorable,” Mayo said. “Just not as much regulation, maybe even roll back.\"\nIt may be seniors — historically one of the most reliable voting blocs — who may get the last word.\nMayo expects insurers will readjust some of the MA benefits so they can grow — or at least hold — their margins in light of the recent changes, a reversal of the years-long cycle of \"massive\" investment in these perks.\nExtras like a supplemental grocery benefit could be eliminated for next year, while the share that patients pay out of pocket for services such as dental or vision care could increase.\nSeniors will see those reductions in benefits or increases in co-insurance during Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, when they choose their health insurance for next year. Open enrollment kicks off Oct. 15, less than a month before the presidential election on Nov. 5.\nThat means the 33 million Americans now enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, making up over half of Medicare-eligible adults, may get mad after their plan drops benefits that enticed them to sign up in the first place.\nThey may carry that anger into the voting booth. That may be what insurers are hoping for.\nJanna Herron is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Democrats are deservedly disheartened at the drubbing voters administered in the 2024 elections. Americans didn’t just restore Donald Trump to the White House, they also gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress and exiled the Democratic Party to the political wilderness.\nTrumpism rules, it seems. But there could be another trend at work that will boomerang back on to Trump, eventually: Americans may be chronically gloomy about stagnating living standards and bound to take it out on whoever is in charge.\nFor three elections in a row, voters have bounced the incumbent party from the White House. Trump upset Hillary Clinton in 2016 in what was partly a vote against the slow-growing Barack Obama economy. Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020 amid widespread dissatisfaction with Trump’s handling of the COVID pandemic.\nThe 2024 election was a referendum on the policies of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket in August. The outcome: thumbs down, especially on economic issues.\nThe incumbent party normally has a decisive advantage in presidential elections, whether the president is running for another term or passing the torch to a successor. Unless there's a recession, the incumbent party typically wins. Yet there was no recession in 2016, when voters replaced the incumbent Democrat with a Republican. There was a short recession in 2020, but it ended seven months before Election Day, when voters ejected Trump. And despite high inflation, there’s been no recession under Biden. The power of incumbency simply isn’t what it used to be.\nInflation was clearly ruinous for Biden and Harris, but so was their inability to fix intractable problems that go back decades. In a recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, the economy ranked as the top issue for 2024 voters and 58% rated the economy as “weak.” Of people who cast a ballot, 76% said they voted for change.\nTrump was the change candidate because he’s been on the sidelines for the past four years — and there were no other choices. So will Trump bring the change Americans want? On some issues — notably immigration — he could, because the president has the authority to set policy in a way that will make a difference. But there’s a good chance many of the problems vexing voters in 2024 will be just as nettlesome in 2028, when Trump will be the incumbent promoting his own vice president, JD Vance, as the future of Trumpism.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nAmerica has become a wrong-track country. For the last 20 years, more than half of all Americans have been unhappy with the direction of the country, according to Gallup. There was an uptick in satisfaction under Trump, but that crashed amid COVID. The broader trend is stark: Not once during the last 20 years has satisfaction approached the peaks of the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president, or the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan served two terms.\nThe most likely explanation for this national gloom is worsening wealth and income inequality, with well-educated workers in dynamic areas getting ahead and undereducated workers in stagnant parts of the country falling behind. Wealth for college graduates has grown by 356% since 2000, according to Federal Reserve data. Wealth for Americans with just a high school degree has grown by just 100% during the same time frame. The portion of wealth held by college grads has grown from 60% to 74% since 2000. For high-school grads, it has dropped from 17% to 9%.\nThere’s nothing wrong with well-educated people in the right places getting wealthier. But there’s a lot wrong with lesser-educated people who make up the majority of the US population getting poorer. Trump appeals to that demographic when he rails against companies shipping jobs overseas and migrants working for less pay than Americans might.\nIn the 2024 election, 43% of voters had a college degree, while 57% did not. Less-educated Americans are decisive in national elections. They’re the ones demanding change, in the form of paychecks that stretch further and improving living standards. But there’s no simple cure for a tech-based service economy that has left millions of workers behind.\nTrump’s plan to slap new tariffs on imports and deport millions of undocumented migrants won’t do anything to restore the sort of high-paying manufacturing jobs millions of Americans relied on 50 years ago. Automation, artificial intelligence, and agile supply chains provide the efficiency big companies crave. They don’t want to hire more Americans to do manual labor for higher pay, and Trump can’t browbeat them into doing so.\nSome cities and states have programs to match employers with local schools that train the types of workers they need, which helps young people develop the skills that will help them get ahead. Trump hasn’t proposed anything like that. Instead, he falls back on lazy, supply-side orthodoxy: Cut taxes and regulations and turn businesses loose to grow and prosper. Developments of the last 40 years show that this enriches the shareholder class, with little trickling down to workers.\nIf anything, Trump could put upward pressure on prices, just as inflation seems to be abating, by deporting migrants who work on farms and at processing plants and making imported products more expensive through higher tariffs. Trump hasn’t proposed anything to lower housing costs, and interest rates are already drifting upward in anticipation of slightly higher inflation and a lot more deficit spending under Trump. If that happens, rent and groceries could take a bigger bite out of the typical paycheck four years from now.\nBiden’s record as president holds cautionary notes for Trump and other future presidents. Biden actually got measurable results that ought to boost blue-collar fortunes. He signed laws funding infrastructure buildout, semiconductor manufacturing, and green energy investment, which will subsidize employment in those fields years into the future. Some provisions of those laws require employers getting subsidies to hire unionized workers. The economy, meanwhile, has added 685,000 manufacturing jobs since Biden took office, twice the number under Trump before COVID hit and unemployment soared.\nNone of that impressed voters in 2024, and Trump could have just as much difficulty moving the needle during the next four years. And in 2028, the Trumpist candidate will be the incumbent trying to sell voters on more of the same.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-05-15T13:00:07.000Z",
        "article_content": "Just 50 American families have funneled more than $600 million into the 2024 elections in donations to political parties, PACs and super PACs, a new report has found — a staggering figure that underscores the disproportionate influence the wealthy will wield on the outcome of November’s elections.\nThe report, from the progressive nonprofit Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), tracked the top 50 families or individuals, all worth billions, who have pumped the most money into the political system as of early May. \n“These 50 billionaire families alone have the political-spending capacity of over 6 million ordinary American families,” wrote the authors, senior ATF associate Zachary Tashman and senior writer William Rice. They based the comparison on the average net worth of the American family and the average net worth of the 50 families in the report, who have a combined net worth of more than $1 trillion.\nMore than two-thirds, or 69%, of their donations flowed to Republican candidates or causes, including the super PAC supporting former President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, and Americans for Prosperity Action, a super PAC affiliated with the Koch family that supports conservative candidates. Only 23% went to groups supporting Democrats, and the remainder did not have a clear partisan affiliation.\n“That pronounced GOP tilt is a sign that the political spending of billionaire families is largely an investment in preserving familial wealth and power,” the authors argued, noting that many Democrats campaigned on raising corporate income taxes and taxes on the wealthiest 1%, while Republican policies further insulate major fortunes from taxation.\nJeff Yass, a billionaire stock trader from Pennsylvania and newfound ally of Trump, is the largest individual donor so far this cycle, having given more than $70 million, most of it to the far-right Club for Growth and the PAC supporting the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. \nIn a close second is hedge fund manager Ken Griffith, who has focused much of his spending on David McCormick, a fellow hedge fund manager challenging Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who is running for his state’s open Senate seat. \nLinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and his family are the largest Democratic donors on the list and have concentrated their spending on supporting President Joe Biden’s reelection.\nEven among these ultra-wealthy families, political giving was most concentrated at the top. The top 10 families by political donations ― which also include well-known conservative mega-donors such as the Kochs, Ricketts and Uihleins ― accounted for more than half of the 50 families’ overall spending.\nMega-donors owe their ability to shower political causes with millions in donations to Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a landmark 2010 Supreme Court decision that obliterated most limits on indirect political giving. The decision also enabled donors to make unlimited “dark money” donations, which are not publicly traceable, meaning the total spending by the biggest political contributors is likely much higher than $600 million. \nTrump Had On-Brand Message For Donors Who Wanted Photos With Him At Fundraiser\nAnti-Monopoly Group Blasts Wealthy Maryland Democrat In New Digital Ad\nTrump Tells Donors He'll Keep Cutting Taxes, Only Wants Immigrants From 'Nice' Countries"

        "article_content": "The average inflation rate when Donald Trump was president was 1.9%. During Joe Biden’s presidency, inflation has averaged 5.4%. Many voters think of Biden as the inflation guy.\nYet some prominent investors think future inflation will be worse if Trump wins the 2024 election than if Biden wins. In a June 18 analysis, Goldman Sachs argued that investors should buy gold if they’re worried about the inflationary impact of Trump’s economic agenda, should he become president.\n“We see value in long gold positions as an inflation hedge from geopolitical shock including tariffs, Fed subordination risk, and debt fears,” Goldman analysts wrote. While they didn't identify that as the Trump agenda, those three potential shocks are a clear reference to economic policies Trump has been floating.\nTrump wants to impose a new 60% tariff on all imports from China and a 10% tariff on all other imports. Since tariffs are taxes paid by Americans, that would raise a typical family’s costs by $1,700 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Shoppers would be spending more for the same stuff, which is basically what inflation is.\nTrump also thinks the White House should have more control over the Federal Reserve, a prospect that would alarm financial markets if it ever happened. The Fed has a tough enough job as it is trying to keep inflation and employment at optimal levels, and political interference from the White House could make that a lot harder.\nTrump in particular has pressed the Fed to lower interest rates, even though the standard playbook for bringing down inflation is raising rates to slow the economy. If Trump won a second term and tried to force his own agenda on the Fed, it could easily stoke inflation and undermine confidence in the US economy.\nTrump also wants to extend a set of tax cuts from 2017 that are due to expire at the end of 2025. That would raise the national debt by $4 trillion to $5 trillion, something Trump doesn’t seem to care about. But markets do. At some point, excessive amounts of debt flooding the market becomes “money printing.” That's another factor that can fuel inflation.\nEven though there are two major candidates, there are four possible outcomes for the 2024 election.\nTrump or Biden could each win with their party gaining complete control of Congress, or they could win with a divided Congress. That’s important because it will determine if the president can exploit his party’s control of Congress to pursue a partisan agenda. If the opposition party controls at least one house of Congress, it can block many of the president’s preferred policies.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nBut if Republicans gain full control, watch out.\n“The upside risks to inflation appear larger under a Republican sweep,” Goldman advised. In addition to higher tariffs and more Fed-bashing under Trump, the investment bank points out that a Trump crackdown on immigration could trim the labor force, worsen labor shortages in some industries, fuel higher wages, and push prices up.\nAnother recent analysis by Moody’s Analytics reaches similar conclusions about the economy during a second Trump term. “The policies adopted under the Republican Sweep scenario result in higher inflation and weaker economic growth,” Moody’s Analytics found. That’s largely because new import tariffs and less immigration under Trump would force prices up and drag on growth.\nIn a May analysis, Oxford Economics found that new tariffs and other Trump policies could push the inflation rate a full percentage point higher than it would be without those efforts. Inflationary Trump policies could also compel the Fed to hold off lowering interest rates and maybe even raise rates further to head off new inflationary pressures. That would likely enrage Trump and possibly compel him to try firing Fed Chair Jay Powell, whose appointment lasts until 2026.\nVoters who think back on Trump’s presidency as a time of low inflation might wonder how a second term could be so different. The answer is that the COVID pandemic and geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have transformed the economy and left far less margin for error.\nThe United States and other nations are now “re-shoring” supply chains for key categories of goods, which should make supplies less vulnerable to shocks but also raise costs. Labor shortages for much of the last three years have pushed wages up, another factor contributing to higher prices.\nGlobal energy markets are also much tighter than they were before COVID. Back then, American drillers and OPEC oil nations were competing for market share by basically oversupplying the market. That kept prices low. But plunging demand during COVID led to massive losses and new “capital discipline” that prioritizes profits over share. Virtually no energy producer is willing to overproduce these days, for any reason.\nWhile inflation soared under Biden, it’s heading back toward normal levels. Many economists expect more of the same should he win reelection: continued disinflation, eventual Fed rate cuts, predictable trade policies, and moderate growth. The ultimate status quo scenario is a Biden win with Republicans controlling at least one chamber of Congress, allowing them to block progressive Democratic legislation.\nBiden's economic agenda is still a tough sell to voters, who sometimes have selective memories. Biden is battling a “Trumpnesia” phenomenon in which voters forget about Trump’s erratic handling of the COVID pandemic and other controversies and only remember that gasoline cost less than $3 per gallon. If there’s another Trump presidential term, it could generate very different memories.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "If Donald Trump wins the 2024 presidential election, Democrats are going to be soul-searching at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Trump is a uniquely vulnerable candidate, convicted of crimes, liable for fraud and sexual abuse, bent on autocracy, and older than 87% of the US population. If Democrats can’t beat him, who can they beat?\nThe problems with the Democratic Party are evident in Vice President Kamala Harris’s difficulty getting over the margin of error in polls of voters in the seven key swing states: Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada. She has clearly improved on President Joe Biden’s dismal standing since he dropped out of the race in July. But on paper, she should be doing way better. Inflation is nearly back to normal levels, unemployment is low, gas prices are manageable, and crime is falling. Those factors normally pave the way for a decisive incumbent victory.\nOf the two political parties, Republicans have morphed into a fractious mob under Trump, animated by anger, grievance, and a primordial urge to burn everything down. If Trump loses his second presidential election in a row, Republicans will face their own reckoning and the prospect that a rabid minority, no matter how passionate, cannot win national elections.\nDemocrats, however, have hardly stepped into the breach and offered normal Americans a political refuge. Instead, Democrats have gone to the other extreme and left millions of voters feeling alienated by both parties. Here are three mistakes Democrats have made in recent years that will explain what went wrong if they lose in 2024:\nThe socialistic Vermont senator clearly caught traction when he ran for president as a Democrat in 2016. He energized young crowds by railing against “obscene levels” of income inequality. He proposed heavy new taxes on businesses and the wealthy, which would finance free college and a government healthcare plan to cover all Americans. Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination, but Sanders got 43% of the primary vote, persuading other Democrats that voters were open to radical new ideas for lifting up young Americans and those who were falling behind.\nSanders and other progressive Democrats followed up with ideas such as the “Green New Deal” in 2019, which would have been a sweeping government takeover of the energy and transportation sectors meant to address climate change and rectify widespread social inequities. Most Democrats supported the Green New Deal, even though it failed in a gimmicky congressional vote. Democrats stuck with the idea, viewing it as a winning issue in the 2020 elections.\nSame with “Medicare for All,” the Sanders plan for a single-payer government healthcare program. In the 2020 Democratic primaries, many of the most prominent Democratic candidates supported Medicare for All — including Kamala Harris.\nFast-forward to 2024, and it turns out that moderate swing voters don’t want the massive disruptions that would come with these two gigantic government efforts, even if they support the end goals. As the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris has abandoned her earlier support for both the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, because she needs centrist voters who prefer gradual improvements over massive government intervention. Sanders showed how to energize America’s most liberal voters, and many other Democrats followed his lead, including Harris. What they didn’t account for is the blowback: Policies that excite liberals alienate centrists. Harris is struggling with that problem now.\nDuring his 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden famously promised to “end fossil fuel.” He seemed to act on that promise as soon as he took office in January 2021 by canceling the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, siding with climate activists on an emotional issue that stood as a litmus test for whether you supported the cause. Biden was clearly seeking to appease progressive Democrats — the Sanders wing — passionate about addressing climate change.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nWhoops. Turns out the whole country remains highly dependent on fossil fuels to get around and power their homes. When gasoline prices spiked in 2022, hitting $5 per gallon for the first time, voters naturally thought about Biden’s hostility to fossil fuels and concluded that he was the reason they were paying more to gas up. That’s not really true, but Biden himself recognized the image problem he faced. Biden released oil from the emergency reserve and called on drillers everywhere to produce more. Energy prices have come back down, but it’s probably no coincidence that Biden’s approval rating cratered in 2022 and never recovered. Harris backs all of Biden’s policy decisions and faces the same voter skepticism on energy that Biden does.\nBiden reversed many of the tough migration restrictions Trump instituted during his presidency, including emergency limits enacted during the COVID crisis in 2020. The result was a surge in all types of migration, including those entering illegally, with border crossings hitting a record high last December. Many of those migrants ended up in big cities like New York and Los Angeles, traditionally run by Democrats, overloading the resources available to deal with newcomers. Some Democratic mayors and governors began pleading with Biden to do something.\nBiden finally issued an order this past June that sharply limited entry by migrants. Border crossings have since plunged to levels last seen during Trump’s term. The political question is, what took Biden so long? The answer, once again, is that Biden was catering to the liberal wing of his party, which favors looser migration policies. Harris is now in the awkward position of explaining how the Biden-Harris team went from reversing Trump’s migration policies to basically reimposing them.\nTrump has captured the Republican Party by appealing to its nationalistic culture warriors and basically driving out those in the center. Democrats haven’t gone quite as far, but Biden, Harris, et al., have pandered to their own base, the progressive left, veering back to the center only in national elections where they need moderate votes. No wonder many voters view the 2024 presidential election as a choice between terrible and slightly less terrible.\nHarris and the Democrats haven’t lost yet. It’s possible Harris will persuade just enough moderate swing voters that she’s one of them, after all. If she wins, she might even govern more to the center than Biden, who won the general election in 2020 as a centrist but then drifted left.\nWhoever wins, the lesson for both parties in 2024 is that they’ve left the moderate swing voters whose support they crave during the last few weeks of the election feeling politically homeless during the other 47 months.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

She also said she will push to “substantially increase” the credit to $6,000 for newborn children less than a year old for middle- and low-income families.\n“We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child’s life,” Harris said during a speech in North Carolina rolling out her economic agenda.\nUp Next: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: How Would That Impact You If You Are Retired?\nAs a presidential candidate leading up to the 2024 election, Harris proposed replacing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed by ex-President Donald Trump with a monthly refundable tax credit worth up to $500 for people earning less than $100,000 a year. The policy, known as the LIFT the Middle-Class Act, aimed to help offset high living costs by providing middle-class and working families with money to help pay for everyday expenses.\nHarris has called for the construction of 3 million new housing units over four years as a way of easing a “serious housing shortage in America,” PBS reported. She also backs the following:\nLegislation to create a new series of tax incentives for builders who construct starter homes sold to first-time homebuyers.\nA $40 billion “innovation fund” for businesses building affordable rental housing units.\nExpansion of a Biden administration plan to provide $25,000 in potential down payment assistance to help certain renters buy a home.\nAnother one of Harris’s proposals as a presidential candidate was a student-debt forgiveness plan that was part of a broader initiative to invest in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Black entrepreneurs. Under that plan, Pell Grant recipients would have up to $20,000 of their student loans forgiven if they started a business in a disadvantaged community and operated it for at least three years.\nAs VP, Harris endorsed Biden’s proposal to cancel up to $20,000 of federal student loans per borrower. That plan was eventually shot down by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nHarris previously supported a government-run “Medicare for all” program that would provide healthcare for everyone, The New York Times reported. She later changed that position to focus on strengthening the Affordable Care Act. Her campaign suggested she would “preserve temporary increases” in subsidies for private plans, according to the NYT. She also backs the latest White House budget that seeks new aid for residents in the ten states where Republicans declined to expand Medicaid.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "With less than a month until Election Day, voters everywhere are still trying to figure out which U.S. presidential candidate to vote for — and how their policies could affect taxes.\nThe outcome of this upcoming election could have a significant impact on personal and business taxes at a federal level — and possibly local or state, as well.\nRead Next: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes — Here’s What That Would Mean for the Economy and Your Wallet\nFind Out: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nOnly recently chosen as the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris hasn’t yet provided many specifics about her proposals or policies as pertains to taxes. She has, however, promised not to raise taxes on individuals earning less than $400,000 annually.\nAside from that, there are a few other possible changes that could come about if Harris is elected. But again, the exact changes are still unknown. They’re also not entirely determined based on who the U.S. president is.\n“Since tax legislation originates in the legislative branch, changes in tax law will be largely dependent on who controls the House and Senate, regardless of who wins the presidency,” said Christian Putnam, CPA and CEO of Augur CPA, a tax and accounting firm based in the Washington, D.C. with clients across the United States.\nDespite this, Putnam did suggest a few possible tax law changes that could occur if Harris wins the election.\nIt's Going Viral: Want to Retire Rich? Suze Orman Says You're Missing This Key Money Move\nBack when Donald Trump was in office, he signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which brought about some significant changes to the tax code at the time. The TCJA impacted both individuals and businesses with its tax reforms — and more specifically, its tax cuts.\nHere’s how the TCJA has affected individual taxpayers:\nMost income tax brackets fell slightly. Only the 10% bracket — the lowest bracket — and the 35% bracket stayed the same.\nThe standard deduction increased. In 2024, the standard deduction is $14,600 for single filers or $29,200 for married couples filing jointly.\nThe child tax credit increased to $2,000.\nUnder this law, individuals are no longer required to have health insurance to avoid a tax penalty.\nLearn More: I’m an Economist — Here’s My Prediction for Social Security If Kamala Harris Wins the Election\nThe TCJA also had an impact on businesses. For example:\nIt reduced the corporate tax rate to 21%.\nPass-through businesses — like sole proprietorships and S-corporations — received a 20% deduction for their pass-through income.\nFor individuals, these tax reform benefits are set to expire in 2025. The changes to businesses, however, are permanent.\nIf Harris wins, Putnam predicted there will be a removal of the state and local taxes cap.\n“The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limited the deduction of state and local taxes to $10,000,” Putnam said. “This limitation disproportionately impacted taxpayers in high-tax states, such as California and New York, which are Democrat leaning.”\nThis prediction is supported by the fact that, when the TCJA was initially passed, no House Democrats supported it.\nAnother possible change under a Harris presidency is in regard to tax preparer regulations.\n“Many of the COVID-[era] stimulus programs were implemented through tax policy,” said Putnam. “These programs, such as the Employee Retention Credit, were unfortunately abused by unscrupulous tax preparers and promoters.”\nSince July 2024, the IRS criminal investigation has initiated hundreds of criminal cases regarding the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) alone. Fraudulent claims are estimated to come out at an estimated $7 billion.\nThe increase in fraudulent claims and other scams could cause the government to buckle down further on tax preparers.\n“Should Harris win the presidency, it’s likely that the tax preparation industry will be subject to new regulations to curb abuses of tax benefits in the future,” said Putnam.\nAs certain tax laws are set to expire at the end of 2025, that leaves room for potentially new — or continued — policies.\n“The Republican tax law changes from 2017 are set to expire in 2025,” said Putnam. “If Harris becomes president, it’s likely that some of these changes will expire or be updated through a major tax bill at the end of 2025.”\nIt’s possible that Harris will also continue the same policies initiated under the Biden-Harris administration’s FY 2025 budget.\nThis budget details Biden’s “vision to protect and build on the Administration’s progress and invest in all of America to make sure the middle class has a fair shot and we leave no one behind,” according to a White House statement. “The Budget will lower costs for families, protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and reduce the deficit by making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and cutting wasteful spending.”\nAmong other things, here’s what the FY 2025 budget includes:\nIncreased taxes on wealthy taxpayers and major corporations.\nIncreasing the corporate minimum tax rate to 21%.\nKeeping the tax rate the same on those earning $400,000 or less.\nCutting taxes for lower- and middle-income families with children.\nRestoring and expanding the Child Tax Credit.\nAny changes to individual and business taxes are still up in the air. Whether these predictions come to pass is dependent on more than who the president is.\n“Again, all of the above is highly dependent on who controls the legislative branch,” said Putnam. “A split executive and legislative branch makes these changes less likely or less expansive.”\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

In fact, Visual Capitalist reported that the S&P 500 rallied over 24% in 2023 alone.

However, this strategy usually doesn’t yield the best results. It’s best practice to invest using a dollar-cost averaging strategy where you continuously buy shares of a company over time, regardless of the price per share. Dollar-cost averaging usually results in better returns over the long term versus timing the market.\nThe price of real estate has spiked since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "date": "2024-09-11T23:32:09.000Z",
        "article_content": "Warren Buffett has yet to weigh in on the 2024 campaign, even as an electoral battle rages in the Oracle of Omaha’s backyard that could put either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump over the top. Buffett’s silence is unusual, though, since he has been a vocal supporter of Democrats in previous contests—and so, too, is the set of circumstances that have made Omaha the potential deciding factor in choosing the next U.S. president.\nWhile Omaha is located in Nebraska, a deeply red state that is not considered a battleground in the same way as Pennsylvania or Georgia, one pocket of it is very much in play. That’s because of a political quirk that means the Cornhusker State does not follow the vast majority of other states (Maine is the only other exception) in awarding all of its electoral college votes with a winner-take-all approach.\nInstead, since 1992, two of Nebraska’s five electoral votes have gone to the winner of the popular vote, with an additional vote assigned to the winner in each of the state’s three congressional districts.\nWhile the first and third districts lean heavily Republican, the state’s second district—which consists of Omaha and its surroundings—is up for grabs. The district voted for Joe Biden in 2020 and Barack Obama in 2008, which didn’t gain much attention when both Democratic candidates won the electoral college handily.\nThis year, however, there’s a plausible scenario in which the single electoral vote tips the balance. If Harris carries the three “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin but loses to Trump in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and a Republican-leaning Maine district, the race could be tied 269-269 and head to the House of Representatives. That’s unless Harris wins Nebraska’s second district, which would get her to the magical number of 270.\nThat permutation hasn’t been lost on either party. Trump allies have tried to change Nebraska law to implement winner-take-all rules. Democratic voters in the area, meanwhile, are putting up signs that simply feature blue dots to underline how a single electoral vote could be the difference.\nSo far, though, Omaha’s most famous resident has yet to weigh in on the 2024 election, despite becoming involved in previous contests.\nThe 94-year-old Buffett’s silence this election season is a relatively new development for a business leader with a history of backing Democrats.\nThe son of a four-term Republican congressman, Buffett began to support liberal causes dating back to the civil rights movement. He’s donated millions in support of abortion rights and has helped raise money for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, appearing onstage with the latter multiple times during her 2016 presidential campaign.\nIn 2011, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman famously wrote a New York Times op-ed titled “Stop Coddling the Superrich.” He lambasted America’s tax code for making his secretary pay more on a percentage basis than ultrawealthy individuals, like himself, whose fortune is largely tied up in stock.\nBuffett has opposed other progressive movements, however. In 2015, he wrote in the Wall Street Journal that ideas like expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit were better solutions to income inequality than raising the federal minimum wage. Last year, his annual letter to shareholders appeared to take aim at President Joe Biden and other Democratic lawmakers for attacking share buybacks, warning investors that a complete opponent of such repurchases was either an “economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue.”\n“I’m a Democrat, but I’m not a card-carrying Democrat,” Buffett told CNBC in 2020, saying he had sometimes voted for Republicans.\nAccording to Federal Election Commission data, Buffett last made a political donation in November 2019, when he gave $106,500 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He also contributed $2,800 to Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly’s successful Senate campaign that year.\nThis time around, however, don’t expect Buffett to shell out cash for Harris—or put a “blue dot” in his front yard.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "When determining which presidential candidate to vote for, there are many things to consider. One of them is how the candidate’s policies could impact your finances. Based on her early campaign speeches, several potential policies for Kamala Harris could significantly impact wealthy retirees.\nLearn More: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for Social Security If Kamala Harris Wins the Election\nFind Out: 7 Reasons You Must Speak to a Financial Advisor To Boost Your Savings in 2024\nKeep reading for a look at four changes that wealthy retirees can probably expect if Harris wins the 2024 presidential election.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nMany people are unaware of what a wealth tax is. That’s because comprehensive wealth taxes have never been implemented in the United States. A wealth tax is just how it sounds: a tax on a person’s net worth, typically when that net worth is above a certain amount. If a wealth tax was established, it could potentially mean double or triple the taxes for wealthy individuals.\nHarris has been on record supporting a national wealth tax, which could significantly impact wealthy retirees. While there would likely be ways to structure your estate to bypass some of the tax, most people would still end up paying significantly more in taxes than they do today.\nRead Next: Here Are All the Promises Trump Has Made About Social Security If He’s Reelected\nPart of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was an increase in the estate tax exemption. In 2024, the federal estate tax exemption is $13.61 million for a single filer and $27.22 million for a couple. If Harris is elected president, there’s a good possibility she would lower the estate tax exemption or increase the estate tax rate. This would increase the tax liability for wealthy families after their death.\nWhile the percentage of American families exceeding this threshold is likely small, a reduction back to the old levels is likely to trigger an estate tax for additional families.\n“If Kamala Harris wins in 2024, I expect capital gains and estate tax rates will increase significantly,” said David Brillant, tax and trust and estate lawyer and founder of Brillant Law.  “My firm has created irrevocable trusts and family limited partnerships to help clients avoid estate taxes and capital gains at death.\n“However, if ‘step-up in basis’ is eliminated, clients may face capital gains taxes on unrealized gains in assets they inherit. Higher income and capital gains tax rates will reduce investment income and the value of taxable portfolios.”\nHowever, even with a potentially lower exemption level or higher tax rate, there are some things wealthy retirees can do to minimize their estate tax burden.\nInstead of waiting until death to transfer assets, wealthy retirees could gift those assets today and reduce the overall value of their actual taxable estate.\nHowever, there is also a gift tax to be aware of. For 2024, each gifter can give up to $18,000 per recipient annually. Anything above that amount is subject to a gift tax. It’s expected that Harris would most likely reduce the gift exemption, as well.\nIf the retiree is not ready to give the money away and would rather wait until their passing, they could establish an irrevocable trust. Irrevocable trusts can minimize future estate taxes and help avoid the probate process upon death.\nHowever, once irrevocable trusts are executed, making changes to the trust is very difficult.\nCapital gains are earned when assets, like stocks, bonds or real estate, are sold at a profit. The federal government then charges a tax on these capital gains. Most taxpayers pay a capital gains tax of 15%, but those in the top income bracket pay a 20% capital gains tax. However, these rates could increase under a Harris presidency.\nDepending on how their retirement portfolio is structured, retirees may be more likely to feel the impact of a higher capital gains tax. This is because they may be selling assets to provide income during retirement.\n“Kamala Harris has proposed raising capital gains taxes for high earners,” said Brillant. “This could significantly impact wealthy retirees who rely on investment income. My clients with large investment portfolios would likely see higher taxes on their capital gains and dividends, reducing their income.”\nBackdoor Roth IRAs are popular for wealthy individuals whose income doesn’t allow them to invest in a Roth IRA. With a backdoor Roth IRA, you’ll invest money in a traditional IRA and roll it over into a Roth IRA. This will allow your income to grow tax-free. However, it’s important to know that if you claim a tax deduction for the traditional IRA contributions, you’ll need to repay that when you convert the funds to a Roth IRA.\n“Harris proposes eliminating ‘backdoor Roth IRAs’ and ‘mega backdoor Roth IRAs,’ which allow high-income clients to contribute more to tax-advantaged retirement accounts,” Brillant added. “Instead, clients may need to rely more on non-qualified accounts and maximize contributions to 401(k)s and HSAs before rates increase.”\nFiscal policies are just one thing to consider when deciding which presidential candidate to vote for. However, if you’re a wealthy retiree, a Harris win in November could have a significant impact on the value of your estate.

        "article_content": "Businesses are becoming more wary of politics this year even as some of their billionaire bosses become more vocal.\nDonald Trump's conviction for falsifying business records could deepen that divide.\nConsider how the 2024 election is playing out inside the companies run by Elon Musk.\nThe billionaire weighed in with over 20 social media posts in the hours after Trump’s verdict, with the Tesla (TSLA) CEO by turns calling the decision politically motivated and accusing the prosecutors of ignoring more serious crime elsewhere in New York.\n\"If a former President can be criminally convicted over such a trivial matter — motivated by politics, rather than justice — then anyone is at risk of a similar fate,\" he wrote in one post.\nBut a review of Musk's companies — from Tesla to SpaceX to tunneling startup Boring Company to X's own corporate account — found they all appear to have ignored the topic completely.\nAnd the money doesn't appear to be flowing from Musk's companies, either. Political action committees, or PACs, are traditionally the main way for a corporation to engage financially in politics, and Tesla's political arm hasn't donated to anyone since 2018, according to the campaign finance trackers at OpenSecrets.\nLikewise for Twitter, now called X. The last recorded PAC donation there was also in the 2018 election cycle, long before Musk acquired the company.\nMusk previously said he wouldn't contribute to either candidate in 2024, and this past week he also denied reports he was having conversations with Trump about a role in the administration if Trump wins.\nMusk's situation has many echoes across corporate America.\nWhile large companies are still a major source of political donations, there is evidence that more and more are trying to sidestep any blowback associated with their campaign spending.\nOne measure of corporate political engagement is maintained by the Center for Political Accountability (CPA). Its measure shows more companies shying away from political donations or deciding to say more about why they finance certain candidates.\nOf the 345 companies that have been on the S&P 500 since 2015, 270 of them now prohibit or fully disclose spending on candidates or their committees. That's up from 168 a few years prior, according to CPA’s analysis.\nThat is a reflection, CPA president Bruce Freed said, of corporations concluding that when it comes to open political engagement \"there are real risks with that,\" both from employees and outside observers.\nFreed, who is also the group's co-founder, added in an interview before Thursday's verdict that billionaires are less reticent about weighing in as they \"may be looking at politics in the world differently.\"\nIn the aftermath of Trump's conviction Thursday, a series of Trump-friendly billionaires weighed in with their support. In addition to Musk, investor David Sacks and Pershing Square Capital CEO Bill Ackman offered their political takes online.\nThe hands-off approach from company boardrooms began long before Trump's conviction, following years of increasing public scrutiny of where companies put their money.\nPerhaps most notable in recent history are the repeated public dings that companies got for donating to the 147 members of Congress who tried to overturn the 2020 election.\nPerhaps no company has been more closely watched on that front than Toyota (TM), which gave generously to those lawmakers and faced pressure and even an advertising campaign in response.\nSo far in 2024 — according to OpenSecrets — Toyota has given a total of $0 to candidates from its PAC.\nClose observers still expect corporations to remain a powerful force in the 2024 race even if they seek to avoid overt controversy.\nFreed notes that companies have other means to donate money that are less public and harder to track. One avenue is focusing on state races by using little-known \"527\" committees that allow unlimited contributions to candidates running for state or local offices.\n\"The contributions to super PACs, 527s come out of the [company's] Treasury funds, and so there are no limits,\" Freed notes, adding that his group's research has found that this spending can nevertheless impact an array of high-profile issues and is \"serious money that has serious impact.\"\nBut overall, the waxing and waning influence of companies and billionaires will be one part of a heated election season that could contribute to economic turmoil in the months ahead.\nAs 22V senior managing director and head of Washington policy research Kim Wallace put it in a Yahoo Finance interview on Friday, \"It's going to be a very loud summer.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "The 2024 election is heating up and if former President Donald Trump manages to retake the White House, it’s bound to shake things up big time for American workers, the cost of living and the larger economy. What changes could be in store for the job market under a second Trump term? We asked a finance expert to weigh in.\nFor You: I’m an Investor: I’m Making These Money Moves Immediately If Trump Wins\nLearn More: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nDavid Kass, clinical professor of finance at the University of Maryland Robert H. Smith School of Business, broke down some of the key areas where Trump’s policies could move the needle on employment.\nAlso, see how a Trump presidency could impact the middle class.\nTrending Now:\nBoomers Have the Wealth--Why Are Thousands Still Homeless?\nSuze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nOne of the biggest factors that could sway the job landscape is whether Trump tries to extend or make permanent the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that he signed into law back in 2017.\nFor You: Trump-Era Tax Cuts Are Expiring — How Changes Will Impact Retirees\n“This legislation lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, and the top personal tax rate from 39.6% to 37% as well as increasing the standard deduction. A Republican-led Congress would be likely to move in this direction,” Kass said.\nBy paying less taxes, businesses would have more cash on hand to grow and hire more workers. However, critics argue corporate windfalls could line executive pockets instead of trickling down to average employees.\nKass expects Trump to double down on his “America First” policies, restricting immigration and making aggressive trade moves against other countries.\n“His likely program would include reducing immigration and imposing tariffs on our trading partners,” he said.\nWhile limiting immigration could theoretically open up more jobs for American citizens, it could also create labor crunches in immigrant-heavy sectors like agriculture, construction and hospitality. Trump’s trade war threats and tariffs could disrupt supply chains, driving up costs for businesses and consumers alike.\n“The overall result would be a widening of the substantial budget deficit and result in additional fiscal stimulus leading to an increase in inflation from the current 2.8% (core PCE-preferred measure of the Federal Reserve),” Kass said.\nAn inflation spike could eat into consumers’ purchasing power, making it harder for families to make ends meet. The Federal Reserve might have to take the punch bowl away by raising interest rates sharply to wrestle inflation under control — which could put the brakes on hiring and economic growth.\nSpeaking of the Fed, Kass thinks Trump would bring the heat to keep interest rates low in a potential second term.\n“Trump has also indicated that he would likely apply pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates resulting in additional monetary stimulus and further inflation,” he said. “Although inflation is likely to increase, unemployment is likely to remain at historically low levels in the 3 to 4% range.”\nCheaper money could give a short-term sugar high to the economy and job market. But easy money coupled with Trump’s deficit-financed spending could create the perfect storm for out-of-control inflation that ultimately negates any employment gains down the road.\nThe bottom line is Trump’s policy brew could send the job market in conflicting directions. Some industries might boom thanks to tax cuts and an insular labor pool. But working Americans could eventually get burned by spiking prices, more trade turmoil and the debt hangover from Trump’s free-spending ways.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n8 Rare Coins Worth Millions That Are Highly Coveted by Coin Collectors\n3 Ways a Balance Transfer Helps You Manage Debt (And How Much it Could Save You)\n6 Items From Costco You Shouldn't Wait To Buy on Black Friday\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I’m an Economist: Here Are My Predictions for the Job Market If Trump Wins the Election"

        "date": "2024-11-06T18:25:55.000Z",
        "article_content": "View this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nDonald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, has become America’s 47th president after crossing the 270 electoral college-vote threshold necessary to clinch the presidential election and defeat Kamala Harris.\nWhile a handful of states have yet to declare official winners, Trump locked down all of the states he was expected to, as well as several pivotal battleground states including North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. He also was on track to win the popular vote for the first time in his three campaigns for America's highest political office. At 11 a.m. the day after the election, the vote totals were:\nTrump: 71,571,051 votes (51%).\nHarris: 66,712,662 votes (47.5%).\nTrump’s victory follows a bitter, hard-fought campaign in which American voters were asked to choose between sitting Vice President Kamala Harris, who focused on the dangers a Trump presidency posed to democracy and women’s reproductive rights, and former President Trump, who asked them a classic challenger’s question: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?”\nAfter four years of a COVID epidemic, inflation spike, and an affordability crisis, America’s voters—like voters the world over—answered “no” and chose to punish the incumbent administration. A majority (52%) of respondents in an October Gallup poll said they and their family were worse off than four years before, a percentage only approached in 1992, when Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush after one term.\n“Almost every major election in the world this year was a change election. Incumbents lost because voters believed their country was heading in the wrong direction,” Eurasia group founder and president Ian Bremmer posted on X. “The United States is no exception.”\nAmericans' desire for change was intense enough that about 3 in 10 voters told AP VoteCast, a massive nationwide survey of over 120,000 voters, that they wanted a total upheaval in how the U.S. is run—and more than half said they wanted substantial change.\nThe economy and immigration—Trump’s two top issues—far overshadowed Harris’s priorities of democracy and abortion in the same survey, with some 9 in 10 voters saying they were very or somewhat concerned about the cost of groceries.\nBefore receiving the official electoral votes required to win, Trump addressed a lively crowd at his Florida campaign headquarters, using his “Make America Great Again” slogan.\nTrump called the election result a “magnificent victory for the American people” and declared it the beginning of a “golden age” for the country.\nHe told supporters, “I hope one day you’ll look back and consider this one of the most important days of your life.” Trump also noted his party’s recapture of the Senate, saying, “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.”\nTrump's election reverberated across world markets, as investors anticipated more market-friendly policies and economic growth.\nThe three main U.S: exchanges rose in premarket trading, with the Dow adding over 3%, while Trump Media—often viewed as a tracking stock for Trump’s election chances—spiked some 36% in early trading. Shares in Trump ally and funder Elon Musk’s Tesla also jumped more than 12%, while Bitcoin shot past $75,000 to a new all-time high, on Trump’s pledges of support for crypto.\nEven stocks in Europe, which could be a casualty of a new “America First” Trump administration, managed to squeeze out 1% gains in early trading.\nShares in China, a likely target for massive tariffs under Trump, were the exception, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng falling over 2% and Shanghai’s index slipping a marginal 0.1%. The currency in regular Trump target Iran also took a massive hit, falling to a all-time low on his election.\nFortune will have plenty of reactions, insight, analysis, and reporting in the coming hours, days, and weeks. But first, let’s take a look at how the 2024 election went down.\nOur official tally:\nKamala Harris has been declared victor in 17 states—Vermont, Maryland, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, New York, Colorado, California, Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Virginia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Minnesota, plus the District of Columbia, Maine's 1st congressional district, and Nebraska's 2nd congressional district—capturing 223 electoral votes.\nDonald Trump has been declared victor in 27 states—Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Arkansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Louisiana, Wyoming, Ohio, Texas, Missouri, Utah, Montana, Iowa, Kansas, Idaho, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Maine's 2nd congressional district and Nebraska's 1st and 3rd congressional districts—capturing 279 electoral votes.\nRemember, you need 270 electoral votes to win the U.S. presidential election.\nBitcoin smashes its all-time high as Trump clinches victory.\nThe Trump trade rebounded as Election Day leaned Republican.\nPrediction markets surged towards Trump after results started rolling in.\nElon Musk says he wants to be a political player even after the election is over.\nRussian meddlers targeted polling places with bomb threats in critical swing states.\nTrump Media stock was halted three times on Election Day after its price dropped 15% in 15 minutes.\nBelow is a complete rundown of when polls closed for every U.S. state. Worth noting: Parts of some states close earlier than others, which we flagged.\n6:00 p.m. ET: Kentucky (some polls close), Indiana (some polls close)\n7:00 p.m. ET: Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, Florida (some polls close), New Hampshire (some polls close)\n7:30 p.m. ET: North Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia, Florida (some polls close), New Hampshire (some polls close)\n8:00 p.m. ET: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Kansas (some polls close), Michigan (some polls close), North Dakota (some polls close), South Dakota (some polls close), Texas (some polls close)\n8:30 p.m. ET: Arkansas, Kansas (some polls close), Michigan (some polls close), North Dakota (some polls close), South Dakota (some polls close), Texas (some polls close)\n9:00 p.m. ET: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, Wyoming\n10:00 p.m. ET: Montana, Nevada, Utah, Idaho (some polls close), Oregon (some polls close)\n11:00 p.m. ET: California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington\nMidnight ET: Hawaii, Alaska (some polls close)\n1:00 a.m. ET: Alaska\nHere's a rundown of the notable final polls in the lead-up to Election Day:\nNPR/PBS News/Marist: 51% Harris, 47% Trump\nReuters/Ipsos: 51% Harris, 47% Trump\nABC News/Ipsos: 49% Harris, 46% Trump\nNew York Times/Siena College: Harris leads in all but one swing state (Michigan)\nOf course, Trump ended up winning the election—through the popular and electoral vote—by a considerable margin.

        "title": "October surprise: Trump just blew a huge lead, and the Madison Square Garden rally started the drop, says top data scientist",
        "date": "2024-11-03T13:39:15.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump is suffering an historic descent in the campaign's final days, an ongoing freefall that's turning what looked like a walkaway for the former president into what's most likely a Kamala Harris victory. That's the view from Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, whose proprietary model's proven right-on in past elections.\nTrump's darkening prospects mark a dramatic reversal from the election's dynamic less than 13 days ago. During the first three weeks of October, Donald Trump staged a remarkable comeback, rebounding from a huge deficit to a commanding lead. With less than two weeks to go before Election Day, Trump appeared en route to a smashing victory.\nHarris countered the Trump surge by pivoting from an attack on Trump's policies to spotlighting his \"unstable\" personality and the \"obsession with revenge.\" That message failed to resonate with voters as Trump moved relentlessly upwards in the electoral vote count, as forecast by the Miller framework. By contrast, Trump was tapping a powerful undercurrent: The deeply unpopular Biden record, especially on the economy.\n\"The macro numbers on growth, and employment look good, and the Democrats keep touting them,\" says Miller. \"But people don't care about GDP or the national jobless rate. They care that they're paying so much more for groceries than four years ago, that they can't afford to buy a first home because mortgage rates are so high, or afford a car loan to replace the beat-up model in the driveway, or that they have no savings and need to work two jobs to get by.\"\nIn other words, although Harris stresses that the stats look fine, people don't feel fine due to the dollar squeeze in their own lives. Plus, Americans are fretting more and more about this nation's involvement in foreign wars. The Biden administration's policy of sending arms to Israel for bolstering its forces in the war versus Iran, and to Ukraine for fortifying its campaign to defeat the the Russian invasion is deeply troubling to a large swath of the electorate—especially since it's unclear how long those conflicts, and hence our involvement, will last. Trump, on the other hand, has been striking a quasi-isolationist stance on the stump that seems to be finding favor on the trail.\nPut simply, Americans are pissed at where Biden's led the U.S., and by extension, at Harris.\nTime was so short, Miller concluded, that Harris was unlikely to significantly close the yawning divide by taking new policy positions, shifting her campaign rhetoric, or even upping her ground game. \"My view was that only a major shock could change the course of the race,\" he says, \"meaning an earthquake that hugely benefited Democratic ticket.\"\nThe earthquake happened. It wasn't ignited by the Harris camp, but an unforced error by the Trump team. The event that transformed the election was billed as the capstone to a movement bound for glory: The Oct. 27 rally at Madison Square Garden, in the heart of Trump's home city of New York, before rowdy audience of 20,000.\nThe spectacle boasted around three-dozen speakers, but few top politicians and no widely-respected statesmen. They divided mainly between highly controversial Trump loyalists who embodied—and from the podium, championed—the candidate's most extreme views, and marquee names from the worlds of entertainment and right-wing media.\nThe cast encompassed such divisive figures as disgraced former New York Mayor and onetime Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was disbarred and suffered a $148 million judgment that forced him into bankruptcy for falsely claiming that Georgia officials tried to rig the 2020 election; Stephen Miller, Trump's former White House advisor who advocates draconian measures to curb immigration; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the gadfly Trump has promised to install in a top position if he wins, and whose radical environmental views contradict the former president's; and Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire given to outrageous tweeting in his self-owned platform X.\nAlso onstage were Tucker Carlson, fired from his perch as a Fox News host for promoting unfounded conspiracy theories, and Hulk Hogan, who in full wrestling regalia mounted a chest-pounding performance that drew roars from the crowd he dubbed \"Trump-o-maniacs.\"\nThe speeches unleashed shockwaves just when Trump needed to stay smoothly on course. The most infamous gaffe: insult comedian Tony Hinchcliffe calling Puerto Rico \"a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean,\" followed by his howler that Latinos \"love making babies.\" Businessman Grant Cardone's charge that \"Harris and her pimp handlers will destroy the country\" amplified the negative messaging. During his address, Trump himself kept the roast going, characterizing his opponent as \"a low IQ individual.\"\nAccording to Miller, the gathering that Trump called a \"love fest\" seems to have spread not unity and inclusion, but hostility—especially to women. None other than Nikki Haley, Trump's leading female rival for the nomination, expressed that view in an Oct. 29 interview for Fox News.\n\"This campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes or whether she's dumb,\" intoned Haley. \"Your target market is suburban women who are college educated. This bromance thing, this masculinity stuff [on display at MSG] it borders on edgy to the point where it's going to make women uncomfortable. Fifty-three percent of the electorate are women. They care about the issues and how they're being talked to. There was no reason to have a comedian at the event,\" where the swipe at Puerto Rico proved \"harmful\" to the Trump-Vance ticket.\nIn the days that followed, while the Dems paraded the Hinchcliff disaster in the media, Trump advocates kept the bad vibes coming. A super PAC launched by Musk shared a video on X that that used vulgar wordplay to demean the vice president. Then in a Carlson interview that aired on Nov. 1, Trump denounced former Congresswoman and long-time foe Liz Cheney as a warmonger, and suggested she be sent into battle, proving she's a coward and hypocrite.\n\"Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?\" stated the GOP standardbearer. \"Let's see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\"\nMiller bases his model not on the polls or opinions of the pundits, but on the prediction or betting markets. His main data source are the prices posted on what he deems the most trustworthy, and highly liquid, political wagering platform PredictIt. Miller applies his own methodology to the PredictIt odds, and translates the result into the share of electoral college votes that each candidate commands at any given moment. Miller updates the counts every minute, and you can follow the race, practically in real-time, on his site Virtualtout.io.\nThis writer first followed Miller's methods in the 2020 election, and was impressed by the discipline of his approach and his accuracy in gauging results for both the presidential contest, and the two Senate seat runoffs in Georgia that secured control of the upper chamber for the Democrats.\nMiller's numbers show a jaw-dropping swing to Harris that would have seemed unimaginable two weeks ago. On Oct. 26, Trump tallied 367 electoral votes to just 171 for Harris, putting the GOP nominee 196 in front. The next day, Trump headed his blowout at MSG, and no sooner did the giant screens go blank than he started losing ground. On Monday, Harris gained 18 electoral votes, and she kept improving every day through midnight on Thursday. By then, Harris had gained 58. Trump's lead shrank by over half from 196 to 80.\nThe drop accelerated from there. On Friday, Trump's horde fell by an extraordinary 39 electoral votes, lowering his total to 270 (the number needed to win), against 268 for Harris. By 10 a.m. on Saturday, Trump had shed another 5, putting Harris in the lead by by 273 to 265. All told, in the seven days since Trump peaked on Oct. 25, he's lost 102 electoral votes. According to the Miller model, what looked like an invincible lead collapsed in a week.\nWhere does the race stand now, according to Miller?\n\"It's been going back and forth around the 270 line,\" he told Fortune. \"Right now, it's a tossup according to the PredictIt numbers. The big question in my mind is, how much Republican bias is there in the prediction markets?\"\nMiller notes that he assessed the GOP tilt in the 2020 races for PredictIt, and made the right adjustments for it, as evidenced by the accuracy of his forecasts. For the 2024 election, he's using the same correction methodology he deployed four years ago. But now, though he hasn't put precise numbers on the difference, Miller reckons that the betting sites lean more strongly to the GOP than in 2020.\n\"It's my experience working studying prediction markets in the past that lead to that conclusion,\" observes Miller. \"I believe all of the prediction markets are more biased to Republicans than in 2020.\"\nThe sites overestimate the GOP odds, he says, in part because the betters are mainly males who often also wager on sports, and love taking risks. He adds that Musk's lavish praise for prediction markets may have pushed the scales further in the Trump-Vance direction, noting that a few Trump \"whales\" could be inflating his odds of victory on some markets that allow individuals to wager unlimited sums.\nA main reason he uses PredicitIt, Miller avows, is that the site imposes a relatively low limit on the dollars any single gambler can place on a candidate. Hence, the platform can't be swayed by rich Trump fans. Miller reckons that PredictIt's prices are less exaggerated than the odds on competing sites, but his preferred platform still tips more Republican than 2020. As a result, he says, his model's electoral vote count could be understating Harris's newfound advantage.\n\"Her edge is probably higher than the handful of votes shown on the continuous feed for virtualtout.io,\" he says. \"It's just impossible to completely correct for the tilt. Even though it looks like a tossup by the Virtualtout numbers, I'm anticipating a Harris-Walz victory.\"\nIt was just a week ago that Miller's forecast picked Trump as the probable winner. In addition to the expected Republican bias in the prediction markets, the direction towards Harris, says Miller, is consistent with a \"fundamental\" in calling the outcome. \"Candidates usually win by moving to the center, and Harris has claimed the center. Trump's just kept going more and more to the extremes,\" he says.\nMiller also notes that his real time \"ticker tape,\" which he calls \"tinyticker,\" shows the impact of campaign events instantaneously, whereas the polls capture these changes, and often inaccurately, only after four or five days. His system caught this sudden, massive transition just when it began, and has been tracking its trajectory minute by minute since.\nTime looked too short for Harris to rebound, yet it happened. Now, the question is whether in a span of three days, the former president can reverse a trend that he himself set in motion, on one of the world's biggest stages, in a belly flop heard coast to coast.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "As the 2024 U.S. presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump looms on the horizon, you may be wondering how the outcome could impact your personal finances. It’s impossible to predict exactly what will happen. But elections bring a certain amount of economic uncertainty, and there are a few financial steps you should consider taking before the ballots are cast.\nFind Out: I’m an Economist: Here Are My Predictions for Inflation If Biden Wins Again\nRead Next: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)\nRather than trying to time the market based on election projections, the wisest thing to do is to shore up your finances with moves that make sense regardless of who wins.\nTo get their advice, GOBankingRates spoke to Aaron Cirksena, founder and CEO of MDRN Capital, as well as Dennis Shirshikov, adjunct professor of economics at CUNY and head of growth at GoSummer.\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\nIn any time of uncertainty, it’s important to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. A well-diversified investment portfolio can help reduce your vulnerability if certain sectors take a hit.\n“Before the election, it’s crucial to diversify your investment portfolio to mitigate risk,” said Shirshikov. “Given the potential for market volatility, having a mix of stocks, bonds and other asset classes can help protect your investments. Consider including international assets to hedge against domestic market fluctuations.”\nIf you have a stock-heavy portfolio, for instance, you may want to rebalance toward high-quality bonds, which tend to be less volatile. International diversification is another consideration — holding some foreign stocks and bonds can help protect you from U.S.-centric political risks.\nBut remember that trying to guess which industries will boom or bust under a particular administration is risky business. Instead, work with a financial advisor to build an asset allocation aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.\nA new administration could usher in policies that cause interest rates to go up. If you’re planning major purchases like a new car or home renovation, financing sooner rather than later could mean making the most of low rates before any potential changes after the election.\n“With uncertainty surrounding the election, it’s wise to lock in low interest rates on any major loans or mortgages,” said Shirshikov. “Current rates are relatively low, and securing these rates can save you money in the long run, regardless of who wins the election and how interest rates might shift.”\nIf you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, this may be an opportune time to refinance into a fixed-rate loan and secure a stable monthly payment for years to come. Even if you already have a fixed-rate mortgage, crunch the numbers to see if refinancing could meaningfully lower your rate and save you money over the life of the loan. Just be sure closing costs don’t eat up too much of the potential benefit.\nNo matter who wins, having a solid emergency fund is always good advice. The lead-up to a high-stakes election is as good a time as any to boost your reserves.\n“Building a robust emergency savings fund is always a smart financial move, but it’s particularly important in uncertain times,” said Shirshikov. “Aim to have at least six months’ worth of living expenses saved to buffer against any economic downturns or job market instability that could result from post-election economic policies.”\nIf the election outcome spooks the markets, you don’t want to be in a position where you’re forced to sell investments at a loss to cover surprise costs. An adequate emergency fund gives you some peace of mind, and some breathing room just in case a new administration’s policies end up impacting your employment or healthcare costs, for example\nCapital gains taxes aren’t going away, but how much you owe could change depending on who takes office. It’s wise to have strategies in place to manage your tax liability regardless of what shifts may come.\n“For people earning over $500,000 annually with significant capital gains in nonqualified accounts, they should keep in mind capital gains management,” said Cirksena. “Having a plan to minimize tax implications could be beneficial.”\nYou might consider increasing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs and 529 college savings plans where investments can grow tax-deferred or even tax-free. Maxing out these vehicles not only minimizes current tax burdens but also shields a portion of your wealth from future policy changes.\nWork with a financial planner who can help you create a capital gains strategy that works for your unique circumstances.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nIn Less Than a Decade, You Won't Be Able To Afford Homes in These 20 Arizona ZIP Codes\nThese 10 Used Cars Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle\n5 Signs You're the Financially Savvy One of the Group\n5 Myths About Debt That Nobody Should Believe in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I’m an Economist: 4 Major Money Moves You Should Make Before the Trump vs. Biden Election"

Wall Street strategists, economists, and traders will be able to be more definitive in their calls for investors.\n\"I think regardless of the outcome, having the election behind us, we will, I think, put everyone's mind at ease, and we'll be able to get back to work and focus on moving forward together as a country,\" Marriott chairman David Marriott said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. \"You hope and pray every day that our political leaders in this country can find a way to work together and work on solutions for the country and not be so bifurcated as we have been.\"\nInvestors will be able to move on as well, hopefully putting more stock in a company's fundamentals than a Trump post on Truth Social or a Musk post on X, formerly Twitter.\nIn the meantime, like you, we await the conclusion here at Yahoo Finance. Except to say we will have some stellar reporting from our newsroom across live programming, our new podcasts, and digital articles on Election Day, the day after, and the entire week.\nYours truly will be live on the Opening Bid podcast from the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square with a great roundtable of guests on Wednesday morning, joined by my friends on the Capitol Gains podcast team. All that actionable investing insight kicks off at 8 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance, YouTube, and major streaming platforms.\nOur all-star live markets blog (found daily at the top of our homepage) will be up and running on Yahoo Finance around the clock on Election Day and right on into the next day. And we are coordinating with the Yahoo News team to provide relevant political and financial insights as results roll in on Election Day.\nSo use Yahoo Finance and the Yahoo ecosystem as your guide to business and markets in what will be a super busy week.\nTo that end, here's what prominent names in the world of business have told me about potential tariffs and future regulation in the lead-up to Election Day.\n\"The tariffs on China really affect, in our case, components that we're bringing out of China in many cases that are still single country available in China. So many of our suppliers haven't diversified geographically yet. They're in the process of doing so in many cases. A lot of these tariffs [being floated by Trump] would apply to components that we would be bringing into the United States as an example, to actually complete manufacturing of a product in the United States.\n\"And so I think we have to be thoughtful, and hopefully whatever administration is in will be thoughtful about how, and be somewhat surgical about, where they choose to deploy tariffs. But we're very much into creating pro-growth trade policies and I think that's what's really important to this country.\"\n\"When you look at tariffs, I'm not sure we know how to express how that will impact the economy, because in some ways the whole idea is if people say now that something being imported it's more expensive, they may choose not to buy it. Some of these assessments assume that everyone will just pay that higher price. But I think the idea is to say, unless someone's a monopoly supplier and there are no alternatives of goods comparable being manufactured in our own country, then you have a different sort of a problem, possibly a national security problem.\"\n\"I think for our industry, actually, it's a huge headwind. And there's a lot of reasons why, right? We've already got high tariffs on footwear out of China, it's 27%-ish. Out of Vietnam, it's about 20%. So an additional 20% or 25% or whatever — it's huge. The conversation is massive. To absorb that as a business begins to take investment out of R&D, takes it out of consumer demand creation, takes it out of experiences. So we have to pass those on to the consumer. And you can't pass a 25% lift in cost completely.\"\n\"I think the first thing I would ground that conversation in is this [artificial intelligence] technology is incredibly important for humanity, and it will create a tremendous amount of opportunity and eventually, wealth for everybody. It's a really powerful technology. We want to make sure as many people have access to it as possible. So I think we have to be very considerate in what the regulations are.\n\"And then the regulations that we would advocate for are around transparency. So for example, where are these models getting their data? What are the weights between the various data sources and how are they used? I think that's the sort of thing that is really important for the broader public to know when engaging with any of these models.\"\n\"At the end of the day, there are tariffs now in China. We have a limited amount of production in China, so anything else in China probably wouldn't affect us much. But, overall, if there are tariffs, it'll be a level playing field. So everybody will be affected, and we'll deal with it the very best that we can. I've been through the tariff cycle before when I was at Logitech [as CEO], and it's manageable and we'll work through it.\"\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "article_content": "The 2024 U.S. presidential election season is heating up, and the primary season is wrapping up. Yet, no matter whether you are a Democrat, Republican, Independent or none of the above, election-year stocks could be a great opportunity for your portfolio.\nEven before ballots are cast on Nov. 5, 2024, many stocks with election-related catalysts will likely make big moves in anticipation of the results. As you would expect, some stocks stand to gain if it appears likely that presumptive Republican party candidate Donald Trump will win a second, non-consecutive term as President.\nThere are stocks poised to gain if it becomes apparent that the presumptive Democratic party nominee, Joe Biden, will win re-election. Alongside these more result-dependent election-year plays, there are also stocks that, irrespective of who wins in November, stand to gain over the next four years.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nLook at these three election-year stocks and see why each may be a buy ahead of November.\nSource: JosephRouse / Shutterstock\nGeo Group (NYSE:GEO) lost big when the Democrats won back the White House in the 2020 Presidential elections. Shortly after his inauguration, President Biden issued an executive order that phased out the use of private prison operators like Geo to manage Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities.\nWhile not affecting all of Geo’s business, this EO was perceived to threaten this debt-laden company’s prospects. As a result, GEO stock dipped to multi-decade lows. However, since 2021, Geo shares have bounced back in a big way, especially this year.\nThe company has won new contracts with other federal agencies. Geo has also been successfully refinancing its outstanding debt. Yet what’s been really pushing GEO higher has been Trump’s poll numbers, which suggest he could win back the White House. GEO could keep rising if this trend continues, as a Republican administration would likely revoke the EO above.\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\nIf you’re looking for one of the bipartisan election-year stocks, look no further than Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). After the election, the occupant of the White House could change, but what will not change is the continued increase in geopolitical strife.\nThis includes growing tensions between the U.S. and China and the Russia-Ukraine and Mideast conflicts. With defense spending by the U.S. and its Western allies set to keep rising, leading defense contractor Lockheed Martin is likely to continue delivering fiscal results that exceed expectations.\nThat’s not all. Besides this geopolitical catalyst, which could drive earnings growth and share price appreciation for years, LMT stock is also appealing for its dividend growth track record. Shares currently yield 2.77%, yet LMT’s payouts have increased by an average of 7.93% annually over the past five years.\nSource: Susan Law Cain / Shutterstock.com\nSturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) is one of the election-year stocks to buy if you’re betting on a “blue wave” this November. Firearm sales exploded during the pandemic era, but demand began to decline starting in 2022. Since then, the slowdown has persisted.\nThis has, in turn, resulted in declining sales and profitability for Sturm Ruger. That’s why RGR stock, which in 2021 briefly hit prices north of $80 per share, has tumbled to around $45 per share today. However, if Biden wins re-election, especially if the Democratic Party wins back the House of Representatives, giving it full control of Congress, we could see a further push for gun control legislation.\nMuch like during the Obama years, renewed fears of a “gun grab” may emerge. If polls start swinging back in favor of the Democrats, RGR and other firearm stocks could begin to rally again.\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a long position in GEO. He did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nThomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of\nMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "article_content": "We’ve entered another election year, with President Biden likely to face off once more against former President Trump. The polls currently show a tight race, though Biden’s approval ratings have slipped since his victory in 2020. There’s ample time for that to change before November 2024 – if the economy stays strong under Democratic policies, Biden could regain his edge.\nI’m not here to make election predictions. But it’s wise for investors looking to make strategic investments to game out various scenarios. If the Democrats pull off another win, what stocks should be on your shopping list? Which companies and sectors stand to benefit from four more years of Biden’s plans and priorities?\nI’ll share seven stocks worth snatching up if you think Team Blue will hold the White House. These aren’t partisan picks – just smart bets based on where Biden and the Democrats plan to steer the economy. I’ll look at stocks poised to profit from continued government spending on infrastructure and climate initiatives.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nOf course, I’ll have another article soon for investors betting on a potential Republican win. These stocks will highlight companies aligned with former president Trump and the GOP’s tax-cutting, deregulatory vision. Let’s focus today on Democrat-friendly stocks and start building a portfolio to prosper if Biden manages to repeat his 2020 feat. Even if Biden’s prospects look murky, savvy investors should plan multiple moves ahead. The Justice Department is throwing sand in Trump’s gear, so nothing is crystal clear yet.\nSource: Shutterstock\nIf you are a long-time Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investor, the company’s latest earnings report was likely a disappointment for you. Revenue missed estimates, and the company’s quarterly net profits declined sequentially due to production and delivery challenges. However, I believe too many investors are overly pessimistic about Tesla’s future prospects.\nIt’s true that rising interest rates have dampened demand for big-ticket items like EVs. Tesla also faces intensifying competition, especially in China. Yet, with just 1% EV adoption in the massive U.S. auto market, Tesla retains tremendous room for growth in its home territory over the long-run. Once interest rates decline and macro conditions improve, pent-up demand for Tesla vehicles could drive surging sales.\nCurrently, being able to buy TSLA stock under $200 per share seems like a bargain to me. This is a revolutionary company leading the sustainability revolution. Even with near-term headwinds, few can match Tesla’s brand power, vertically-integrated structure, and software/AI expertise. Tesla holds the technology to eventually offer an autonomous ride-hailing network that is far more profitable than selling vehicles.\nI’m also bullish because Democrats overtly favor EVs and clean energy incentives. So, policy tailwinds could strengthen considerably if a Democrat retakes the Presidency in 2024. Betting against Tesla has proven foolish time and again. I believe investors with a five-to-ten-year horizon will be rewarded handsomely buying TSLA stock at today’s depressed valuations.\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nLike Tesla, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) has faced demand issues thanks to rising interest rates and the chilling macro environment. Its stock has plunged over 32% from its highs. Yet, I spy a golden buying opportunity for solar stocks, and FSLR stock is one I’m including in this bunch.\nAs mentioned already, Democrat administrations strongly back renewable energy development, with solar and wind at the forefront. If a Democrat retakes the White House in 2024, expansive climate incentives could supercharge solar adoption. Even under divided governance, ongoing cost efficiencies will continue, making solar ever more cost-competitive for households and businesses.\nIn the company’s third quarter, First Solar delivered 27.4% revenue growth. Analysts forecast 33% revenue growth for all of 2023, with strong profitability to follow. The company’s superb 33.5% net profit margin is due partly to generous government solar subsidies, and I think those subsidies are unlikely to disappear anytime soon. With a forward price-earnings ratio of 12-times based on 2024 earnings estimates, FSLR stock seems like a bargain relative to its earnings growth potential.\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is an American energy tech innovator specializing in advanced solar solutions like microinverters. Its systems are gaining share by maximizing solar efficiency in residential and commercial markets.\nLike its peers, Enphase faces demand uncertainty in today’s macro environment. Its stock slid 60% from peak levels as part of the broader selloff in equities and higher-multiple tech names. Yet, with ENPH stock having cratered, the company’s risk/reward now looks far more positively-skewed.\nAssuming Democrats regain power in 2024, Enphase is set to benefit enormously, given the Biden administration’s generous stance toward renewable energy credits and incentives. Even more impactful could be the passage of a nationwide clean electricity standard accelerating the shift from fossil fuels. Regardless of policy shifts, U.S. solar capacity will likely increase by 38% this year.\nEnphase aims to keep gross margins near 40% in 2024 while reversing its sales downturn. Its systems will be integral as more households, businesses, and utilities adopt solar plus storage solutions. Enphase’s depressed valuation prices in an overly bearish future. Thus, I think this beaten-down clean energy stock appears primed for upside once growth visibility improves.\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) has not had the prettiest stock chart recently. This EV charging company still operates at a loss and relies heavily on government funding to finance growth. This has led to dilution for current shareholders, and a stock price that has plummeted nearly 96% from its 2021 peak.\nHowever, the pace of decline has slowed recently, after a very tough 2022/2023. CHPT stock has been trading relatively flat since last November, and I don’t anticipate it breaking below the $2 level soon, barring an economic black swan. With $367 million in cash reserves available today, ChargePoint should have enough capital to finance operations for a couple of quarters without requiring further dilution.\nMore government stimulus could prove to be the catalyst that kicks ChargePoint’s growth into overdrive. Just last month, we got word of $623 million in new federal grants for EV charging networks. Consider that a drop in the bucket relative to what’s truly needed to build nationwide infrastructure for mass EV adoption. If the Democrats retain the White House, expect billions more to flow into this still-nascent industry. ChargePoint’s first-mover status in EV charging could pay off in a big way.\nThis stock might look ugly today, but future prospects remain bright if infrastructure spending keeps growing under president Biden.\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\nAlongside the clean energy and EV sectors, the Biden administration has nurtured another sector – defense. Regional wars and geopolitical tensions have escalated over the past two years, with no signs of cooling anytime soon. The U.S. has flooded battlefield allies with American-made weapons and vehicles. A Democrat victory would likely perpetuate this foreign policy agenda and sustain the torrent of money flowing into the military-industrial complex.\nThat bodes especially well for General Dynamics (NYSE:GD). This defense giant manufactures cutting-edge ships, combat vehicles, weapons systems, and information technology for the Pentagon and allies abroad. General Dynamics’ revenue nudged up 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023, while operating profit saw a 5% bump. However, the G700 Gulfstream business jet certification delays did create a slight drag on its results. The company still churned out $3.8 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2023, with a superb 115% cash conversion rate. Expect delayed G700 deliveries to shift into 2024, powering earnings growth. And don’t forget – General Dynamics’ backlog expanded to a towering $93.6 billion.\nThe company paid $1.4 billion in dividends last quarter alone, and anticipate another $4 billion in share buybacks this coming fiscal year. General Dynamics also used $434 million of this cash to repurchase shares, ending 2023 with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. I think GD stock offers nice value, alongside a safe 1.96% dividend yield. This defense giant wins no matter which party captures the White House.\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) produces some of the most lethal and technologically-dominant aircraft weaponry in the world – from stealthy F-35 fighters to missile defense systems. As one of the primary arms suppliers for NATO forces and allies, Lockheed has cultivated strong international demand. With military tensions escalating globally, defense spending is skyrocketing across Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Much of that budget increase directly benefits Lockheed.\nUnlike Russia and China, NATO military doctrine relies heavily on aerial combat operations. That strategic focus prompts member countries to invest disproportionately more in fighter jets and missiles than ground vehicles or naval assets. In other words – the world needs Lockheed Martin’s specialty now more than ever. Despite a slight drop in FY23 revenue and earnings due to one-time impacts, Lockheed achieved a record-high $160.6 billion backlog last quarter. Free cash flow also nudged up to $1.66 billion.\nThis defense titan continues funneling capital back to shareholders, even amid macro uncertainties. Last year, the company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. The stock now trades at reasonable valuation levels compared to historical norms. Expect expanded production of Lockheed’s stealthy F-35, plus elevated demand for tactical missiles like the Hellfire and Javelin. Geopolitical crises show no signs of abating anytime soon. With a new Cold War brewing, Lockheed Martin promises strong, steady growth regardless of election outcomes.\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) may not seem the most exciting stock pick these days. This vaccine giant benefited immensely from taxpayer support through Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer’s share price skyrocketed to nearly $60/share at its peak. But with the pandemic fading and underwhelming demand for boosters, Pfizer has retreated more than 54% from its highs.\nDon’t let the recent slide fool you, though. Pfizer remains a dominant force in the healthcare arena. Excluding pandemic products, the company still delivered 7% year-over-year operational sales growth in 2023. While Covid-19 vaccine revenue will continue fading, Pfizer’s core pharmaceutical business shows enduring strength thanks to new product launches.\nManagement guided for another 6%-8% operational sales expansion in 2024, plus ~11% adjusted earnings per share growth. Pfizer’s robust pipeline and diverse portfolio should power top-line strength for years, making the current valuation look rather tempting. Shares trade at just 12-times forward earnings estimates – dirt cheap by historical benchmarks.\nRising free cash flow generation also enables Pfizer’s generous capital return programs. The company rewards shareholders with a 6% dividend yield, plus ongoing buybacks. For investors with longer time horizons, PFE stock appears primed for upside.\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "article_content": "Trump or Biden: Who will be better for the economy, for corporate profits, and for stock market returns?\nThis is how many investors frame the 2024 presidential election. But focusing just on the two headline candidates misses a factor that may matter more: Markets do best under split government, when one party controls the White House and the other controls at least one chamber of Congress. From this perspective, the battle for control of the Senate and House of Representatives is just as important as the race for the White House.\nStocks do better when neither party has the votes to enact partisan legislation. Since 1933, the average annual return for the S&P 500 index has been 15.7% when a Democratic president had a split Congress and 13.7% when a Republican president did, according to Bloomberg data. Average returns were 12.9% when Republicans had total control and 9% when Democrats called all the shots.\nUnified government, when one party controls Congress and the White House, tends to produce the most dramatic policy changes, such as when Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 and Republicans passed a sweeping series of tax cuts in 2017. During President Biden’s first two years in office, Democratic control of Congress allowed him to sign a huge stimulus bill and the largest set of green energy incentives in US history. Such big changes can transform whole industries and reshape corporate investing decisions.\nA lot less happens under split government, when each party has a check on the other. That leaves fewer policy changes for investors to digest.\nWhile there are only two possible winners in the 2024 presidential election — Joe Biden or Donald Trump — there are eight governing scenarios for 2025. Either candidate could win with his party in full control of Congress. Either could win with the other party in full control of Congress. And either candidate could win with his party controlling the House but not the Senate, or vice versa.\nWhat matters most is whether the government is unified or split, which simplifies it down to four scenarios. Biden could win with a Democratic Congress or a split one, and Trump could win with a Republican Congress or a split one. These are the breakdowns that will determine some crucial outcomes under the next president, including the fate of tax cuts that expire in 2025, the pace of the green energy transition, and healthcare availability.\nTrump and Biden are running neck and neck in polls, making the presidential election a toss-up at this point. Republicans seem likely to win control of the Senate in November, mainly because Democrats have to defend more contested seats than Republicans. The House, meanwhile, could flip back to Democratic control.\nTobin Marcus, head of policy and political strategy at Wolfe Research, puts the odds of a Republican trifecta — Trump winning the White House and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress — at 40%. His odds of Biden winning with a split Congress are also 40%. Trump winning with a split Congress and Biden winning with a fully Democratic control are far less likely, with a 10% chance of each.\nHere’s the outlook under each of those four scenarios.\nBiden wins with split control of Congress. This is a status quo scenario in which much would remain the same as it is now. One of the biggest issues in the next president’s term will be the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts for individuals at the end of 2025. If Congress does nothing, it would amount to a de facto tax hike for most Americans, so Congress is likely to act under any scenario. Biden wants to let all those tax cuts expire except for those applying to people earning less than $400,000 per year, which would raise taxes on the wealthy. But if Biden wins a second term and Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress, they might be able to block most or all of the tax hikes Biden prefers.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nBiden wins with full Democratic control of Congress. Biden could get his way on tax hikes if Democrats control both houses of Congress next year and can use special rules to get around the Senate filibuster. In addition to higher taxes on incomes above $400,000, Biden wants to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. But he couldn’t get the votes for that when Democrats controlled Congress during his first two years, so it might not be in the cards. Other big legislation seems unlikely, given everything Biden has signed already, but he could try again at smaller goals such as making an expanded child tax credit permanent.\nTrump wins with a split government. In terms of legislation, this could be similar to Biden winning with a split government. Democrats would have some leverage to demand higher taxes on the wealthy as part of extending the 2017 tax cuts for most others. Trump wants to kill many of Biden’s green energy incentives, and he has floated the idea of cutting Medicaid and even trying again to repeal the ACA. But Democrats would be able to block him if they held one chamber of Congress.\nThere are other things Trump would likely do that don’t require congressional approval. He wants new tariffs, as high as 60%, on all Chinese imports, and a 10% tariff on imports from everywhere else. He could impose those unilaterally. Trump also vows a massive campaign to deport undocumented migrants and sharply restrict border crossings. He’d undo many Biden-era regulations on energy, automobiles, and banks, and probably replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which could rattle markets given that Fed policy is often one of the biggest factors in investing decisions.\nTrump wins with full Republican control of Congress. A fully empowered Trump would probably try to roll back many of Biden’s green energy provisions and claw back new funding meant to modernize the IRS and beef up tax enforcement. He’d also have a good chance of extending all the 2017 tax cuts. Republicans could pass Medicaid cuts and try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which now provides health coverage for roughly 40 million Americans. Getting some of these through Congress might require sizeable Republican majorities, since a few Republicans might not be on board.\nSo for anybody hoping to trade change and uncertainty in 2025, a Trump trifecta would be the desired outcome of the 2024 elections. The calmest outlook for markets, at least politically, would be a second Biden term with Republicans holding at least one chamber of Congress. But that only appeals if you like the way things are going now.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "One of the cornerstones of former president Donald Trump’s plan to bring down inflation is to ramp up oil and gas production, which he said will drastically reduce energy and other consumer costs.\nIn an interview earlier this month with financial podcaster Dave Ramsey, Trump blamed the Biden administration for the “highest inflation we’ve ever had” and suggested that “people are getting wiped out like never before.”\nLearn More: 5 Things You Should Stop Wasting Money on If Kamala Harris Wins in November, According to Experts\nCheck Out: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nTrump briefly amended those comments by saying inflation is the “highest in 48 years” rather than “ever.” However, he continued to attack the record of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent in the 2024 election.\nBut many economic experts and researchers are skeptical about the GOP candidate’s plan while also warning that other Trump proposals could increase inflation in 2025 should he win a second term in November. Here’s what they had to say.\nTrending Now: Boomers Hold Half of U.S. Wealth--So Why Are Thousands Living Without Homes?\nOne of Trump’s answers is to “drill baby drill,” which has become the catchphrase for cranking out more domestic oil and gas. He claimed that doing so would greatly reduce energy costs.\n“I believe I’ll be able to get energy down to 50% of what it is right now within a period of less than a year,” he told Ramsey.\nThose comments were in line with earlier comments Trump made at a political rally in North Carolina, Politico reported.\n“At the center of our effort to bring the cost of living under control will be the all-out push to end the Biden-Harris war on a thing called American energy,” Trump said at the event. “American energy, we will drill, baby, drill. We’re going to bring energy prices down.”\nCertainly, U.S. consumers would benefit from lower gasoline, heating and electricity costs. Whether Trump’s plan will accomplish that is up for debate, however.\nAs The Wall Street Journal noted in a recent article, energy prices are shaped by “complex global and regional markets that don’t respond quickly to executive orders.” Factors such as the weather and global conflicts typically have a much bigger impact on electricity and other costs than White House policy.\n“It’s mostly just bluster, because the president actually doesn’t have any direct control,” Michael Webber, a professor of energy resources at the University of Texas at Austin, told The Wall Street Journal.\nEven though gas prices have been higher under Biden than under Trump, it’s not for lack of production. Fossil fuel production is “already at record levels” under Biden, Politico reported, adding that “oil and gas prices are largely out of the hands of a president.”\nRead Next: I’m an Economist — Here’s My Prediction for Social Security if Trump Wins the 2024 Election\nMeanwhile, other Trump policies could actually increase inflation, experts say — especially his support for tariffs.\nMany economists opposed high tariffs on imported goods that are much cheaper to source overseas and cheaper to sell here.\nAccording to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center, Trump’s tariffs “would increase consumer prices on imported goods and, perhaps, on domestic products that compete with them.”\nA separate report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggested that Trump’s policies could cause the U.S. inflation rate to climb “between 4.1 and 7.4 percentage points higher than otherwise by 2026.”\nAnother policy that could lead to higher inflation is Trump’s desire to crack down on workers living in the U.S. illegally and deport them en masse.\n“Deporting millions of immigrants now living and working in the U.S. and closing the borders to new immigrants, as Trump promises, would reduce the supply of workers,” the Tax Policy Center (TPC) noted. “That would compel employers to pay higher wages to those still in the labor pool, leading to higher prices and more inflation.”\nAt the same time, the effects of a smaller labor pool “might be somewhat offset” by shrinking demand for goods and services as the population of immigrant consumers declines,” the TPC added.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, investors and analysts are closely monitoring how a potential Kamala Harris victory could impact financial markets, particularly the price of gold. While numerous factors influence gold prices, significant political changes often create ripple effects throughout the economy.\nHere’s how a Harris win in the election could affect gold prices.\nFind Out: Mark Cuban and Many Other Venture Capitalists Are Supporting Harris for President — Here’s Why\nRead Next: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nMatthew Jones, precious metals analyst at Solomon Global, said that any major political shift will have an effect on financial markets, just by introducing an element of uncertainty.\n“Uncertainty often leads to volatility, and both are known to be big price drivers for gold,” he said.\nJones noted that Harris’ proposed policies could lead to changes in government spending and regulatory approaches. Harris supports increased government spending on social programs, as well as infrastructure and climate initiatives.\n“Such expenditure could lead to higher budget deficits, which might weaken the dollar and increase inflation expectations,” said Jones.\nIn this scenario, investors have historically turned to gold as a hedge against inflation. If they do, the increased demand could push up gold prices. “When inflation hits, gold becomes the go-to, the one thing investors cling to for safety,” offered David Materazzi, CEO at Galileo FX.\nLearn More: How Much Is Vice President Kamala Harris Worth?\n“A few of her ideas include raising the corporate tax from 21% to 28%, raising the income tax level for earners over $400,000 to 39.6%, taxing LTCG (long-term capital gains) as ordinary income for individuals with taxable income over $1 million along with a 25% unrealized gains tax on the ultra-wealthy,” said Anthony DeLuca, CFP and expert with Annuity.org.\nThese policies, which could bring positive outcomes, could potentially have some unintended consequences, said DeLuca.\n“All the above will result in is raised cost of goods which will be passed down to the consumer, more government spending which will devalue the dollar and raise our already out-of-control government debt issue and keep business owners from expanding,” he said.\nPolitical shifts can trigger changes in investor behavior.\n“Whenever a Democratic president gets elected, conservatives around the nation start sounding the armageddon alarm and declaring the end of days,” said Brandon Thor, CEO of Thor Metals Group. He also said that conservatives make up a significant portion of gold buyers, which could lead to increased demand for gold as a safe haven asset.\n“Her financial transaction tax would make Wall Street unstable, and when that happens, people turn to gold,” said Materazzi.\n“As interest rates fall, investors will look towards different avenues for portfolio growth,” said DeLuca. “This includes gold.”\nHe added that regardless of who wins the election, the Federal Reserve is expected to begin lowering interest rates, which could be favorable for gold prices.\n“My biggest concern with a Vice President Harris win is her economic stance,” said DeLuca. “At a time where we need inflation to remain level for the Federal Reserve Board to cut the federal funds rate starting in September and through 2025, raising taxes and more government spending is not the answer,” said DeLuca.\nThis could be a delicate balancing act for Harris to navigate.\nExperts generally agree that a Harris victory could mean higher gold prices, if the conditions are right.\nThey also emphasize that the actual outcome will depend on a complicated set of factors. Not all of these factors would be under the control of Harris’ administration, such as the global economy or the economy inherited by her administration from the previous one.\n“Regardless of who becomes president, he/she will inherit an absolute ticking time bomb of a market with the second hand about to hit 12,” Thor said.\nBut predicting market movements is never an exact science.\n“A Harris win could lead to a gold price increase, primarily due to anticipated government spending, inflation concerns, market volatility and potential regulatory changes,” said Jones. “However, the exact impact would depend on the specifics of her policies and how they are received by markets and investors,” he concluded.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\nAmerica's 50 Fastest-Growing Suburbs With Home Values Under $500,000\n6 Strategies Anyone Can Use to Pay Off Debt\nI'm a Debt Expert: Here's How Social Media Warps Our Perceptions of Debt\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How a Harris Win in the Election Could Affect Gold Prices"

        "article_content": "Real estate agent Crystal Bonin had helped her clients put in several offers on high-end homes around Baton Rouge, La., when all of a sudden, they stopped their search.\nThe reason? They were worried about the election, and what it might mean for the future of the husband’s IT business.\nTo hear other industry veterans tell it, stories like Bonin’s are common every presidential election season but are growing more acute in a polarized political environment that has Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump neck and neck in the final week of campaigning. Bonin said outreach texts and calls her office staffers make are being met with requests to follow up after the election.\n“People are like, ‘I need to see who wins to know how it’s going to affect me,’ especially my business owners,” said Bonin, who owns her own firm in Zachary, La. “The normal emotion that they have during a home selling or purchase process is already high. Now, there’s fear and anxiety there.”\nThousands of miles away in Lake Oswego, Ore., real estate agent Nik Kulikov of Cascade Hasson Sotheby’s International Realty said buyers are growing more cautious as they try to figure out what a victory for either candidate might mean for interest rates going forward. And he said some first-time homebuyers are waiting to see if Harris’s promise of down-payment assistance comes to fruition if she wins.\n“We are definitely seeing some hesitancy,” Kulikov said.\nWhile anecdotes like theirs are abundant, political uncertainty may not have much of an impact on the housing market on a national level. Alex Thomas, a senior research analyst at John Burns Research and Consulting, sees similar stories in the surveys of agents, homebuilders, and consumers that his company conducts.\nBut when he and another analyst examined 35 years of data about home sales in the five months leading up to elections, they found that the annual seasonal decline in home sales usually wasn’t any worse during election years than in non-election years.\n“We just have not seen this borne out in the data at all,” Thomas said.\nRead more: First-time homebuyer in 2024: What you need to know\n2024: The same, but different\nMelissa Cohn, a 42-year veteran of the mortgage market, said elections have always given some buyers pause, but she’s noticed a shift in the past four presidential contests, where expectations about winners began to affect interest rates.\n“It seemed that elections were important, but they weren’t this 800-pound gorilla in the room,” said Cohn, the regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage. “I have a group of clients who are sort of business as usual, but a lot of people are just sitting around and wanting to understand what’s going to happen.”\nThomas’s research found only two election cycles — 2000 and 2008 — that saw greater-than-expected drops in home sales, which can likely be explained by recessions.\n“The years where you do see the greatest decline in home sales during that time period, it’s much more a story of what’s going on with the economy,” Thomas said.\nThis year, the economy has been strong, but homebuyers have had a tough time. Existing home sales in September were the lowest since 2010 as buyers confront higher mortgage rates and home prices near all-time highs.\nWhile mortgage rates fell steadily throughout much of the spring and summer, they’ve been on the rise again in recent weeks following a string of hot economic data and — you guessed it — election uncertainty. Real estate transactions typically peak in the summer months before slowing down in the fall and winter.\nRead more: When will mortgage rates go down? What experts say about 2025.\nMortgage loan officer Andy Odeh, who runs The Mortgage Bros with his brother, says that by the time clients land at his desk, most are ready to buy regardless of their feelings around the election. He says he tries to stress the importance of an affordable monthly payment to help his clients tune out political noise.\n“They understand that the market is going to change, and whoever wins this election is not going to drastically change their circumstances in terms of being able to buy,” said Odeh, who is based in Chicago.\nBonin said she typically stays busy in November and December, when many executives for major employers like Exxon and a nearby nuclear power plant move to town while their children are on holiday breaks. And she expects many of her skittish clients will come back after the election, whether or not their preferred candidates win.\n“I think they’ll go back to normal life when they realize the world’s not going to end and they still want the things they want,” Bonin said.\nClaire Boston is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering housing, mortgages, and home insurance.\nClick here for real estate and housing market news, reports, and analysis to inform your investing decisions\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-11-03T16:11:06.000Z",
        "article_content": "A version of this story first appeared on TKer.co\nHistory shows that the stock market usually performed well regardless of the U.S. president’s political party.\nThis suggests that there isn’t a political party that’s necessarily bad for the stock market. Maybe some presidents are better for the market than others, especially at the industry level. But there isn’t clear evidence showing that a particular president alone can have enough of a material, long-term impact that the fundamentals driving the market higher will turn unfavorably.\n“Over time, the stock market’s strongest threads have been the economy and earnings, not who’s in the Oval Office,” Ritholtz Wealth Management’s Callie Cox said.\nAt the margin, however, the results of a presidential election can certainly cause market volatility to rise in the short-term. After all, each candidate comes with very different ideas for policies like the corporate tax rate. Over time, companies will adapt and adjust to new policies as they work to preserve earnings growth. But they need some clarity as to what those new policies could be before proceeding with changes.\nAs such, companies will often take a wait-and-see approach ahead of an uncertain election. That’s a headwind for economic activity in the short-term. And with polling data showing the presidential candidates neck and neck ahead of this year’s election, companies are once again saying that they’ll wait for election results to move forward with any changed business strategies.\n“It was unsurprising that the U.S. election came up quite a bit in last week’s earnings calls,” RBC’s Lori Calvasina said on Monday. “As has been the case in recent quarters, there were numerous references to the uncertainty that the event has created and the adverse impact that uncertainty has had on business activity. Several companies noted the need to simply get to the other side.”\nUncertainty doesn’t only keep business executives on the sidelines. It keeps traders and investors on the sidelines too.\nHistory shows that during election years, the stock market tends to deliver below-average returns ahead of Election Day. However, the rally tends to pick up once we “get to the other side” and the uncertainty wanes.\n“[R]egardless of the election outcome, declining uncertainty typically lifts equity valuations and prices following Election Day by more than the typical seasonality would suggest,” Goldman Sachs’ Ben Snider wrote in a February note to clients.\nThe fact that the S&P 500 fell 1% in October is very much consistent with history.\n“October is the worst month of the year in an election year,” Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick said. “So maybe down some last month shouldn't be a huge surprise?”\n“What also shouldn't be a surprise is strength in November, as this is the best month of an election year,” Detrick added.\nThough, this election year has arguably been unusual in that year-to-date returns have been well above average. Through Friday, the S&P 500 is up a little over 20%.\n“[These gains] would join 2021 (+22.61%), 2019 (+21.17%), and 2013 (+23.16%) as the only years in the 2000s with gains of over 20% up through this point of the year,” Bespoke Investment Group observed on Thursday. “Only looking at election years, however, this year's gain is the largest YTD rally in the S&P 500 since 1936!”\n“With equities having already posted huge returns this year, it raises the question of how performance looks for the rest of the year,” Bespoke added. “With only two prior examples of the S&P 500 rallying 20% YTD headed into a presidential election, it isn't a big sample size so not too much weight should be put on it, but returns in November and from October through year's end have been mixed. Both times saw gains in November while the index was higher for the rest of the year in 1928 and slightly lower in 1936. The only other election year when the S&P 500 was even up 15% YTD through the end of October (1980), November experienced a gain of 10.24% but the rest of the year's gain was just 6.5%.”\nPerhaps the market has gotten a little ahead of itself. Perhaps not. We’ll only know what the rest of the year looks like until it’s behind us.\nElection Day is Tuesday. But experts warn we might not get final results by the end of the day.\n“With polls indicating another very tight race in 2024, many of the same factors that led to a delayed call in 2020 could be at play again,” Goldman Sachs’ Michael Cahill said on Tuesday.\nBut that doesn’t mean the market won’t have a better sense of what the next four years could look like.\n“While we cannot rule out the possibility of a very tight result and prolonged period of uncertainty, most likely the market will be able to gauge the likely presidential winner on election night or shortly thereafter, even if there are a few ‘head fakes’ in the first few hours and media sources take longer to make their call — just like last time,” Cahill said.\nYou don’t have to look very far back in history to see a president you didn’t vote for or wouldn’t have voted for occupy the Oval Office. And odds are, the stock market performed pretty well during his term.\nTo be clear, of course it matters who the president of the United States is: It has an immediate impact on sentiment, it could have short-term and long-term social implications, and it may even move the needle on the potential for economic growth.\nBut from a long-term investor’s perspective, the president has an arguably marginal impact on the already existing forces driving the markets.\nIn the near-term, we should always brace for market volatility. But getting past this election uncertainty — regardless of who wins — could prove to be a tailwind for markets.\n“Big picture, the reduction in uncertainty is almost always positive for asset prices, and we’re at that moment of peak uncertainty,” Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of Citadel, said on Tuesday. “Post election, we'll generally see a risk-on environment as people come to adopt a new regime, whether it's a Harris regime or a Trump regime. This uncertainty will be behind us.”\nThere were a few notable data points and macroeconomic developments from last week to consider:\nConsumers are spending. According to BEA data, personal consumption expenditures increased 0.5% month over month in September to a record annual rate of $20.0 trillion.\nInflation trends are cool. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index in September was up 2.1% from a year ago, down from August’s 2.3% rate. The core PCE price index — the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation — was up 2.7% during the month, near its lowest level since March 2021.\nOn a month over month basis, the core PCE price index was up 0.25%. If you annualized the rolling three-month and six-month figures, the core PCE price index was up 2.3%.\nInflation rates continue to hover near the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%, which has given the central bank the flexibility to cut rates as it addresses other developing issues in the economy.\nGas prices tick lower. From AAA: “The national average for a gallon of gas dipped by two cents since last week to $3.13. Low oil costs and tepid domestic gasoline demand are the primary reasons.”\nThe labor market continues to add jobs. According to the BLS’s Employment Situation report released Friday, U.S. employers added just 12,000 jobs in October. The report was particularly noisy this month with Hurricanes Helene and Milton affecting survey collection rates. Also, transportation equipment jobs fell by 44,400 largely due to the strike at airplane manufacturer Boeing. Nevertheless, the jobs report reflected the 46th straight month of gains, reaffirming an economy with growing demand for labor.\nTotal payroll employment is at a record 159 million jobs, up 4.1 million from the prepandemic high.\nThe unemployment rate — that is, the number of workers who identify as unemployed as a percentage of the civilian labor force — remained at 4.1% during the month. While it continues to hover near 50-year lows, the metric is near its highest level since November 2021.\nWhile the major metrics continue to reflect job growth and low unemployment, the labor market isn’t as hot as it used to be.\nWage growth ticks up. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% month-over-month in October, up from the 0.3% pace in September. On a year-over-year basis, this metric is up 4.0%.\nJob openings fall. According to the BLS’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, employers had 7.44 million job openings in September, down from 7.86 million in August.\nDuring the period, there were 6.83 million unemployed people — meaning there were 1.09 job openings per unemployed person. This continues to be one of the more obvious signs of excess demand for labor. However, it has returned to prepandemic levels.\nLayoffs remain depressed, hiring remains firm. Employers laid off 1.83 million people in September. While challenging for all those affected, this figure represents just 1.2% of total employment. This metric ticked higher recently but remains at pre-pandemic levels.\nHiring activity continues to be much higher than layoff activity. During the month, employers hired 5.56 million people.\nThat said, the hiring rate — the number of hires as a percentage of the employed workforce — has been trending lower, which could be a sign of trouble to come in the labor market.\nPeople are quitting less. In September, 3.07 million workers quit their jobs. This represents 1.9% of the workforce. It continues to move below the prepandemic trend.\nA low quits rate could mean a number of things: more people are satisfied with their job; workers have fewer outside job opportunities; wage growth is cooling; productivity will improve as fewer people are entering new unfamiliar roles.\nJob switchers still get better pay. According to ADP, which tracks private payrolls and employs a different methodology than the BLS, annual pay growth in October for people who changed jobs was up 6.2% from a year ago. For those who stayed at their job, pay growth was 4.6%.\nKey labor costs metric cools. The employment cost index in the Q3 2024 was up 0.8% from the prior quarter. This was the lowest rate since Q2 2021. On a year-over-year basis, it was up 3.9% in Q3.\nUnemployment claims tick lower. Initial claims for unemployment benefits declined to 216,000 during the week ending October 26, down from 228,000 the week prior. This metric continues to be at levels historically associated with economic growth.\nConsumer vibes improve. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index ticked higher in October. From the firm’s Dana Peterson: “Consumer confidence recorded the strongest monthly gain since March 2021, but still did not break free of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years. … Consumers’ assessments of current business conditions turned positive. Views on the current availability of jobs rebounded after several months of weakness, potentially reflecting better labor market data. Compared to last month, consumers were substantially more optimistic about future business conditions and remained positive about future income. Also, for the first time since July 2023, they showed some cautious optimism about future job availability.”\nConsumers feel better about the labor market. From The Conference Board’s October Consumer Confidence survey: “Consumers’ appraisals of the labor market improved in October. 35.1% of consumers said jobs were ‘plentiful,’ up from 31.3% in September. 16.8% of consumers said jobs were ‘hard to get,’ down from 18.6%.”\nMany economists monitor the spread between these two percentages (a.k.a., the labor market differential), and it’s been reflecting a cooling labor market.\nFrom Wells Fargo: “While that marks the highest differential in five months it's still below its pre- and post-pandemic high and consistent with a less-tight labor market. Consumers also grew more optimistic around the labor market outlook in October.”\nCard spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: “As of 25 Oct 2024, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 1.9% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 25 Oct 2024, our estimate of the U.S. Census October control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.66%.“\nFrom BofA: “Total card spending per HH was up 2.6% y/y in the week ending Oct 26, according to BAC aggregated credit & debit card data. Within the sectors we report, entertainment, online electronics and airlines showed the biggest y/y rise since last week. Meanwhile, clothing and department stores showed big declines but were still positive y/y.“\nHomeownership rate flat. From the Census Bureau: “The homeownership rate of 65.6% was not statistically different from the rate in the third quarter 2023 (66.0%) and virtually the same as the rate in the second quarter 2024 (65.6%).“ Definition: ”The homeownership rate is computed by dividing the number of owner-occupied housing units by the number of occupied housing units or households.”\nMany homeowners are free and clear of mortgages. According to Census data analysis from ResiClub, 34.1 million homeowners were mortgage-free — meaning they own their homes outright.\nHome prices rise. According to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index, home prices rose 0.3% month-over-month in August. From S&P Dow Jones Indices’ Brian Luke: “Home price growth is beginning to show signs of strain, recording the slowest annual gain since mortgage rates peaked in 2023. As students went back to school, home price shoppers appeared less willing to push the index higher than in the summer months. Prices continue to decelerate for the past six months, pushing appreciation rates below their long-run average of 4.8%. After smoothing for seasonality in the data, home prices continued to reach all-time highs, for the 15th month in a row.“\nMortgage rates tick higher. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.72%, up from 6.54% last week. From Freddie Mac: “Increasing for the fifth consecutive week, mortgage rates reached their highest level since the beginning of August. With several potential inflection points happening over the next week, including the jobs report, the 2024 election, and the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, we can expect mortgage rates to remain volatile. Although uncertainty will remain, it does appear mortgage rates are cresting, and are not expected to reach the highs seen earlier this year.”\nThere are 147 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.6 million are owner-occupied and 34 million of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates.\nOffices remain relatively empty. From Kastle Systems: “Peak day office occupancy on Tuesday rose six tenths of a point last week to 61.3%. Austin had the largest increase, reaching a peak of 76.7% occupancy, more than five full points higher than last week. Chicago was also on the rise, up 1.7 points from the previous Tuesday to 69.3%. The average low across all 10 cities was on Friday at 32.9%, up a full point from the previous week.“\nManufacturing surveys don’t look great. From S&P Global’s October U.S. Manufacturing PMI: “The US manufacturing downturn extended into its fourth successive month in October, marking a disappointing start to the fourth quarter for the goods-producing sector. Although the rate of decline moderated, order books continued to deteriorate at a worryingly steep pace, and a further build-up of unsold stock hints at further production cuts at factories in the coming months unless demand revives.”\nSimilarly, the ISM’s October Manufacturing PMI signaled contraction in the industry.\nConstruction spending ticks higher. Construction spending increased 0.1% to an annual rate of $2.15 trillion in September.\nThe U.S. economy has been growing. U.S. GDP grew at a 2.8% rate in Q3, according to the BEA.\nFrom Joseph Politano: “Bad time to bet against the American consumer — last quarter, consumption growth had the largest contribution to US real GDP growth in more than three years.“\nBecause the way GDP is calculated includes a lot of quirky metrics that distort the economic picture, economists will often point to “final sales to private domestic purchasers” to get a better sense of the underlying health of the economy. This metric excludes net exports, inventory adjustments, and government spending. That metric grew at a 3.2% rate in Q3.\nNear-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 2.3% rate in Q4.\nThe outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.\nDemand for goods and services positive as the economy continues to grow. At the same time, economic growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less “coiled” these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded.\nTo be clear: The economy remains very healthy, supported by strong consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation remains positive. And the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.\nThough we’re in an odd period in that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.\nThat said, analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.\nOf course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about — such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.\nThere’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.\nFor now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak long-term investors can expect to continue.\nA version of this story first appeared on TKer.co"

        "article_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris might not have won over many Fox News viewers during her Oct. 16 interview with the network, but she didn’t do herself any harm, either. That’s an important victory indicating Harris is a dramatically better candidate than when she first ran for president in 2019.\nHarris knew the Fox interview would be the most combative of her 2024 campaign, and it was.\nAnchor Bret Baier hammered at the Biden administration’s shaky record on immigration, a red meat issue for Fox viewers and one of Democrats’ biggest liabilities with voters. He asked one question after another designed to trip Harris up and create an embarrassing gotcha moment that could damage her campaign. Baier also cued old clips from Harris’s earlier incarnation as a liberal California senator and asked why she once held views out of step with today’s mainstream voters.\nThere were no Harris blunders, gotcha moments, or cringey word salads, which is crucial given that the interview drew 7.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched candidate interview of the 2024 election so far.\nHarris scooted out from under many uncomfortable questions and changed the subject to address her main talking points. She borrowed a couple of tactics from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump: talking over the interviewer and running out the clock with long answers that landed far away from the original question. It might have been frustrating to viewers who really wanted to know why she has abandoned progressive policies such as banning fracking and adopting a single-payer healthcare model. But politically, it was an astute performance.\nIt was also a trick the Kamala Harris of 2019 couldn’t have pulled off. Some voters remember that Harris ran for president back then, but it was a truly forgettable affair. Harris dropped out of the 2020 Democratic primaries in December of 2019, before voting even began. She was the first major candidate to bail. It wasn’t that she failed to catch fire. It was more like she face-planted by reaching for something she wasn’t ready for.\nWhen Harris announced her candidacy in January 2019, some supporters thought she might be an electrifying fast riser, like a female Barack Obama. She raised some money, did well in some polls, and had a fiery standout moment in one of the Democratic debates. But Harris struggled to define herself and tended to bungle impromptu remarks. Her campaign managers feuded, creating the impression that she was a poor manager.\nThe New York Times panned Harris for the “lack of an abiding theory of government” and said “she floated between the moderate and progressive lanes.” CNN dinged Harris for “message confusion.” Politico said “she built a precarious structure of advisers at the top — a kind of team of rivals whose quiet snarks about each other grew louder” as her campaign neared its ugly end.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nHarris’s stance on healthcare revealed her shiftiness back then.\nEarly in her campaign, Harris said she backed Bernie Sanders’s “Medicare for All” plan, a huge government-run program that would replace private insurance and cover everybody. On CNN, anchor Jake Tapper asked if that meant she would get rid of all private insurance. Harris bashed insurance companies, then blithely said, “Let’s eliminate all that. Let’s move on.”\nBlowback came quickly. Republicans pounced, saying she wanted to take away insurance coverage many Americans were happy with. Unions howled, arguing they had fought hard battles with employers and given up other perks to secure good healthcare.\nHarris eventually pitched her own healthcare plan, which was basically the Sanders plan with carve-outs allowing private insurers to compete with the government plan. By then, however, Harris was sinking in the polls, with Joe Biden — who opposed Medicare for All — pulling ahead. Money ran short. Harris aides bickered and dissed each other anonymously in the press. By early December, Harris called it quits.\nHarris has clearly learned from her mistakes. She stays relentlessly on message these days, and her main message is that Trump would be a disaster if he won a second term. After Biden stepped down and Harris became the official Democratic nominee in August, critics complained for weeks that Harris was dodging hardball interviews to avoid the sort of extemporizing that got her into trouble in 2019. That narrative is now over. Baier gave Harris ample opportunity to misspeak, and she didn’t.\nHarris hasn’t been perfect. When asked what she might do differently than Biden, she should have had a better answer ready than “there is not a thing that comes to mind.” That may be her biggest gaffe so far. She’s also been arch and slippery in explaining why she has become more tolerant of fossil fuels and tougher on immigration. She could easily say her views have changed as circumstances have changed, but one thing she refuses to do is criticize President Joe Biden for anything or even imply that maybe he got it wrong here or there.\nStill, Harris has shown that she learns on the job and gets better with age and experience. Trump has not shown that. If anything, Trump is more shrill, more insulting, and more radical than during his presidential runs in 2020 and 2016. His latest tariff plan would plunge much of the world into a destructive, protectionist trade war. And some of his own former advisors consider Trump autocratic, even fascist.\nHas Harris improved enough?\nAs any weekend golfer knows, you can get a lot better and still be lousy. Harris is still trying to be everything to every possible voter she might win. And her practiced answers on many topics can leave you wondering how she really feels. But a president who changes with the times is better than one who doesn't.\nMaybe she'll be better still four years from now.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-10-13T09:40:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Investing.com -- The outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election is poised to affect the biotechnology sector, as both major parties present policy proposals that could reshape drug pricing, regulation, and research investment.\nAs per analysts at RBC Capital Markets, biotech companies face uncertainties as Democrats and Republicans outline their healthcare agendas.\nThe Democratic Party, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, has a more aggressive stance on drug pricing. Harris supports expanding the Inflation Reduction Act, which would allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of up to 50 drugs per year. This policy is likely to place pressure on companies heavily dependent on Medicare pricing.\nCompanies such as Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), and Neurocrine (NASDAQ:NBIX) Biosciences, all of which have high exposure to the IRA, would likely face the most negative impact.\nAn expansion of pricing controls into commercial markets and a cap on out-of-pocket costs for generics could also compress profit margins across the sector.\nHowever, not all biotech firms would be adversely affected by a Democratic victory. The Harris administration’s focus on mental health, women’s health, and oncology could prove beneficial to companies developing treatments in these areas.\nMental health-focused firms like Intra-Cellular Therapies (NASDAQ:ITCI) and Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AXSM), as well as oncology firms such as Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) and Nuvation Bio, stand to gain from expanded funding and access to care.\nAdditionally, the Biden administration’s decision to protect orphan drugs used for rare diseases from IRA price negotiations means companies like BioMarin and Ultragenyx might avoid some pricing pressure.\nOn the other hand, a Republican-led government, likely under former President Donald Trump, would offer a more favorable environment for biotech firms.\nRepublicans are expected to take a more moderate approach to the IRA, potentially easing its implementation and reducing the pressure on companies exposed to Medicare.\nRBC analysts point out that this could provide a tailwind for companies like Regeneron and Neurocrine, which would benefit from slowed IRA-related discounting.\nMoreover, Trump’s focus on chronic illnesses could boost companies developing treatments for such conditions, particularly for children. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) are among the firms likely to benefit from initiatives aimed at improving care for chronic diseases.\nAdditionally, Republicans are seen as more favorable toward mergers and acquisitions, particularly if a less stringent Federal Trade Commission head is nominated, which could trigger further consolidation in the biotech industry.\nThe GOP’s stance on drug pricing is, however, not without potential risks. While Trump has backed away from his earlier proposal of a “most favored nation” pricing model, if resurrected, it could be more damaging than the IRA.\nThis policy would require the U.S. to pay the lowest price for drugs globally, disproportionately affecting companies with significant price differentials between the U.S. and international markets.\nFirms like Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) would likely suffer from this scenario, especially if the policy were extended beyond Medicare.\nAnother area of potential risk under a Republican administration is a reduction in emphasis on pandemic preparedness, which could harm vaccine producers like Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA).\nTrump’s earlier policies had focused less on bolstering preparedness, a trend that might continue, reducing the government’s focus on pandemic-related R&D.\nRelated Articles\nWhat is the US election impact on the Biotech sector\nEarnings call: Fastenal reports 3.5% net sales rise, eyes $10 billion revenue\nEarnings call: Oil-Dri reports record sales, integrates Ultra Pet acquisition"

        "date": "2024-04-26T16:34:49.000Z",
        "article_content": "There’s a general understanding among most financial analysts that defense companies provide significant portfolio stability during recessions. Indeed, these companies, especially defense companies with no commercial exposure, dip directly into the coffers of their countries’ governments.\nThus, they are less subject to rising inflation costs and falling consumer spending. However, these bullish perceptions evaporate with significant changes in government, leading to overvalued defense stocks to sell before election cycles.\nThis risk is especially pertinent when considering the upcoming Uinted States presidential and congressional elections in this November. The Democratic party holds the Senate and the presidency and has passed colossal defense spending bills for Ukraine and Israel.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSuch generous spending has engorged several defense contractors who are part of a complicated web of government funding, spending and manufacturing. Therefore, investors should take a deeper look at the revenue streams of these three companies to determine if their valuations are justified.\nSource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.com\nA favorite among institutional investors, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has seen stunning returns since conflict resurged in the Middle East. A rebrand of Raytheon Technologies, RTX maintains distinct business units via its three subsidiaries, Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon. This results in a defense corporation whose revenue incomes are partially exposed to commercial market trends, but buffered by defense spending.\nBearing this in mind, RTX could take a stock value hit by the end of the year for two reasons. The first is the potential for a Republican-controlled Senate, which could cut funding for Ukraine. Furthermore, should Donald Trump secure another term, he openly intends to end the wars in Israel and Ukraine expediently.\nTwo of RTX’s major programs include $1.7 billion in Patriot missiles for NATO and Israel and $282 million for air defense systems for Ukraine.\nThis demonstrates that a change in government policy could cut deep into RTX’s booked revenues and impact future performance.\nSource: Shutterstock\nLate last year, the Thales Group (OTCMKTS:THLLY) found its Glasgow, Scotland-based factory under attack by Palestinian activists. The result was approximately 1.5 million British pounds of damages to factory equipment and machinery. While the damages did little to impact Thales’ bottom line, it underscores Thales’ involvement in weapons development with its Israeli partner, Elbit Systems (NASDAQ:ESLT). Together, the two companies co-develop the Watchkeeper drone, which has seen extensive use as a monitoring platform in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.\nFor Thales, this relationship is one of its many international partnerships that rely on spending from the United States. That’s because Thales operates primarily as a European conglomerate and receives funding through American expenditures for supporting NATO and Israel. This structure could prove problematic after this year’s election cycle for one major reason — a Trump presidency.\nDuring Trump’s first term, he openly worked toward budget cuts to NATO spending. Should he return to the presidency, this rhetoric could resume, impacting international defense companies like Thales.\nSource: Shutterstock\nAs a subsidiary of an international conglomerate, Leonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) faces the same potential political challenges as Thales. DRS has been a critical provider of onboard electronics for the F-35 and several U.S. military programs for decades. Up 47% in the last year, the stock has won major defense contracts that have extensively boosted growth.\nChief among these is its $3 billion contract to support the electric propulsion systems of the U.S. Navy’s new Columbia-class submarines. This contract will support 12 such ships for the next three decades. The project will be a priority as the Navy replaces its aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.\nHowever, the Navy tends to cut short such procurement programs. Take, for example, the cancellation of the Zumwalt-class destroyers and Seawolf submarines over the last 30 years. Thus, DRS could become one of those overvalued defense stocks to sell in the event of cost-cutting measures should the Columbia-class submarines prove too expensive.\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of\nMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "article_content": "The presidential election is upon us, which swing-state voters know all too well after months of relentless political advertising bombardment. Emotional and complex social and cultural issues grab most of the headlines, and when the conversation turns to the economy, inflation tends to take center stage.\nCheck Out: I’m an Economist: Here’s What the 2025 Social Security COLA Should Be To Keep Up With Inflation\nRead Next: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nBut rising prices are much harder on low-income earners than those who enjoy high salaries. So, if you can buy your way out of inflationary pressures, shouldn’t income join the price of gas and groceries at the top of the national list of priorities?\nGOBankingRates spoke with two economics professors about the impact that a second Trump term could have on household earnings. One based his insight on the former president’s first-term policies and record. The other’s perspective comes from his analysis of the impact — or lack of impact — that presidential elections have had on household income levels for decades before the one that America is currently racing toward.\nTrending Now:\nBoomers Have the Wealth--Why Are Thousands Still Homeless?\nSuze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nDennis Shirshikov is a professor of economics, finance and accounting at the City University of New York. A longtime real estate investor, he also serves as the head of growth at the vacation property investment platform Summer. He is a regular contributor to Forbes, Time and the Wall Street Journal, and he covers how governmental policy influences personal wealth in his academic courses.\nRelying on Trump’s original stint in the White House, Shirshikov predicts that any gains to household income will not be distributed evenly if the 45th president becomes the 47th.\n“If Donald Trump wins the 2024 election, I anticipate that household incomes in 2025 could experience uneven growth,” he said. “Historically, Trump’s policies have favored tax cuts and deregulation, which might stimulate higher-income brackets and certain industries like real estate and finance, potentially leading to wage growth in these sectors.”\nExplore More: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for the Working Class If JD Vance Is Vice President\nHowever, Trump’s first-term record leads Shirshikov to conclude that the impact will be mixed for middle- and lower-income households.\n“While tax cuts might offer some relief, the benefits could be offset by inflationary pressures or reduced government spending on social programs,” he said. “An example from his previous term showed that while the stock market and high-income earners benefited significantly, wage growth for the middle class was more modest, and income inequality widened.”\nMariano Torras is a professor of finance and economics at Adelphi University with a Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He has published articles in the Journal of Economic Issues, World Development, Ecological Economics and other prominent academic journals. He specializes in political economy, development economics, institutional economics and ecological economics.\nTorras’s research and experience have not revealed a straight line between election outcomes and earnings.\n“Household incomes in 2025 would have very little, if anything, to do with who wins [this election],” he said. “I know that this is not a common view, but I have always maintained that the credit or blame given to the president for economic conditions is vastly exaggerated.”\nWhile he understands that elections matter, he just doesn’t think they matter much for incomes — at least not directly.\n“As important as it undoubtedly is politically who wins [the presidency], economically, it has historically mattered little which party is in the White House,” said Torras. “It is even more true today, as a long-term secular decline in U.S. economic strength is coming to dominate the periodic ‘business cycle’ vicissitudes. The stock market is an artificial and increasingly deceptive indicator of economic strength.”\nTorras expanded on his last point by saying, “Wall Street is not the economy,” meaning that the investor class has seen its incomes soar, which drags up the often-cited but deceptively rosy national average income.\n“Median — as opposed to the misleading mean — household incomes have mostly been stagnant for 25 years,” he said. “Mass support for quality, benefits-paying jobs in either the public or private sectors seems the only feasible way of reversing this trend. Yet hopes for this appear unrealistic, even if either party is theoretically capable of delivering.”\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "date": "2024-10-30T09:51:38.000Z",
        "article_content": "Over the past few weeks, I’ve been following the forecasts for the presidential race posted by Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University. Miller bases his predictions not on the polls, but on prices displayed on what he deems America’s most trustworthy political betting site, PredictIt. Since June 8, Miller has been updating his forecast once a day. The new numbers are posted at midnight EST on his homepage, the Virtual Tout.\nAlert to election watchers: On Oct. 29, Miller unveiled a new site that continuously displays the electoral vote count that the PredictIt odds suggest each candidate is winning. PredictIt updates its prices once a minute. Miller instantaneously translates those odds into a forecast for the number of electoral votes (EVs) that each candidate is winning. “We’re pretty much showing where the election is moving in real time,” he says. “It’s like having your own personal ticker tape for the presidential election.”\nRight now, you can click on virtualtout.io to watch what this writer considers among the best data for handicapping the wildly careening 2024 race for the White House. Believe me, it’s addictive.\nAs I’ve described in previous stories, Miller deployed PredictIt in 2020 to make superaccurate calls both on the presidential race and the two Georgia Senate runoffs that followed. Miller likes PredictIt because, he says, it’s extremely responsive to campaign events. By carefully studying the workings of PredictIt, Miller developed a model that translates prices posted on the site into the popular vote shares that each candidate commands from moment to moment. To get there, Miller makes a number of adjustments. For example, he found that since most PredictIt bettors are men who also frequently wager on sports, the prices show a slight Republican bias. So his framework corrects for the rightward tilt. Likewise, the data scientist discovered that when one contestant pulls far ahead on PredictIt, the odds swing way too abruptly in their favor. Reason: When the race looks like a sure thing, the bettors flood in to back the “winner,” creating a bandwagon effect that pushes prices to “landslide” extremes far larger than the probable margin of victory.\nMiller also examined all elections since 1960, and found a close correlation between a candidate’s share of the overall ballots cast nationwide, and their percentage of the 538 EVs that decide the winner. He crafted a proprietary framework that converts the popular vote counts derived from PredictIt prices into electoral votes.\nAs of 3 p.m. on Oct. 29, Miller’s “ticker tape” showed the following: Trump/Vance 345, Harris/Walz 193. At all times, you’ll find next to the totals for each candidate a red or green arrow tagging where they stand versus their count the previous midnight, and the amount of the change. In our snapshot, Harris/Walz are at +1, and Trump/Vance –1. “Trump’s still way ahead,” says Miller. “But the prices are moving in the vice president’s favor.” He notes that on Oct. 26, Trump hit his all-time high of 367, against 171 EVs for Harris, capping a giant reversal since the close of September, when the former president trailed by a wide margin.\nSuddenly, Trump’s momentum ceased, and the race tightened. So far, the narrowing been slight, but several factors indicate that Harris may be mounting a major comeback. “She’s already gained 22 EVs, and at some points on Oct. 29 her gains have been several EVs higher,” declares Miller. The turning point, he says, was the rowdy, six-hour Trump rally at Madison Square Garden on the evening of Oct. 27, where an insult comic branded Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean.” That crack could be undermining what had been Trump’s rising support among Hispanic voters, or may just have pushed Americans on the fence into the Harris column.\n“We’re seeing a considerable increase in Americans’ interest in the campaign on PredictIt,” says Miller. “As many people are entering as are betting on the site right now. The current bettors are changing their views, and the new entrants may have different views than the population that’s been dominating the betting until now.”\nMiller notes that the trading volumes on PredictIt have increased from the past average of 37,000 a day to 41,000 over the past week. Heavier trading, he says, means more volatility. “And more volatility makes it harder to predict what’s going to happen on Nov. 5.”\nMiller cites still another reason why, despite Trump’s wide lead, the race remains in flux. He notes that betting sites appear to be advertising for customers on social media. “It’s targeted advertising,” he says. “Like all advertisers, they’re targeting the sites where people are ‘most likely to buy their product,’ in other words, where the viewers are most likely to bet on the election. And it’s the Republicans who wager the most.” As a result, he posits, the sites are attracting an excessive number of GOP-leaning bettors, which could be far more than he’s already adjusted for. That phenomenon could at least partially explain Trump’s gigantic surge in October, whereas we didn’t see the kind of milestones that generally trigger such a surge. The bettors on PredictIt could be seeing big odds for Trump on the sites that do lots of advertising, and adjust their own wagers in Trump’s direction to follow the trend.\nOr, PredictIt could be right-on. Indeed, the site has long been Miller’s North Star. “I’m not yet changing my call that Trump will probably win,” says Miller. “But the numbers are changing. The volatility, new people entering the betting markets, the effect of the ads, all make the outcome increasingly unpredictable.” To get what may well be the best predictions out there, now posted minute by minute, tune in to Miller’s new ticker tape.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-11-04T22:03:11.000Z",
        "article_content": "When the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022, it had bipartisan support. Lawmakers from both political parties hailed the law's importance for reviving US chipmaking capacity in the face of China’s growing influence in the semiconductor sector.\nBut in the final days of the presidential election cycle, the law has become a point of contention between the political parties, putting its future in doubt.\nOn Friday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican who voted against the CHIPS Act, drew criticism after suggesting he would consider repealing the program under the Trump administration. He later walked back his statement, saying he would look to “streamline” the permitting process.\nThat prompted Vice President Kamala Harris to defend the law, touting the jobs created under the Biden administration’s push to bring manufacturing back to the US.\n“That is the way we are going to win the competition with China for the 21st century,” she said.\nThe exchange also came a week after former President Donald Trump said in a podcast appearance with Joe Rogan that the chip deal was “so bad” and that slapping tariffs on chips imported from Taiwan would be more effective.\nThe debate has put major semiconductor companies in an uneasy position as they await grants from the Commerce Department to build out semiconductor manufacturing facilities or foundries. Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), Samsung, TSMC, GlobalFoundries (GFS), and Micron (MU) have all been awarded federal money.\nWhile the law has unlocked nearly $53 billion in funding for roughly two dozen projects intended to bring supply chains back to the US, only one company has received the grant money: Polar Semiconductor, which received $123 million for its chip plant in Minnesota. As for the other companies, the Commerce Department has maintained that individual milestones negotiated to release the money have not been met.\nIntel (INTC) has been the biggest beneficiary, with $8.5 billion in grants committed to the chipmaker, though it is still waiting on money from those grants. The company has bet its future on its foundry ambitions, investing more than $100 billion to expand its factories in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.\n“It's well over two years since the [CHIPS] Act passed, and over that period, I've invested $30 billion in US manufacturing,\" said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \"We've seen $0 from the CHIPS grants. This has taken too long. We need to get it finished.\"\nFurther delay in federal funding would likely impact how Intel moves forward with those projects, given the company’s recent struggles. In its most recent quarter, Intel registered a nearly $17 billion loss. The company has already announced plans to cut 15% of its workforce.\nGelsinger insisted the company has the “financial structure” to finish the projects “with or without the CHIPS dollars.” He added that the 25% tax credit tied to CHIPS Act projects has already lifted the company.\n\"The tax pieces are about three times larger than the grant piece of the CHIPS Act,\" Gelsinger said. \"And with that, we do see that that continues.\"\nAnalysts remain skeptical of any wholesale repeal of the law, largely because of the national security implications stemming from where chips are manufactured today.\nThe US manufactures just 14% of the world’s chips, while China produces 21%, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association. Taiwan manufactures nearly all advanced chips used in artificial intelligence.\n“If you're going to push China further apart, you've got to have some sort of geopolitical, dependable source of semiconductor supply and manufacturing here in the US space,” said John Vinh, managing director and equity research analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets. “I don’t know what [Trump’s] alternative is.”\nHouse Speaker Johnson has said Republicans would consider streamlining the permitting process for CHIPS Act projects.\nKimberly Forrest, chief investment officer for Bokeh Capital Partners, said she expects revisions to the law and its implementation process. That could lead to further uncertainty for chipmakers, regardless of who wins the White House.\n“I think the current administration put a lot of provisions in that may be slowing down actual building of chip plants and chips,” she said. “If either one of them [wins], they’re going to have to look at that and see how quickly they want this CHIPS Act to actually affect how chips are produced in America.”\nThe Biden administration has already reversed permitting requirements for some federal projects. Earlier this year, President Biden weakened provisions that mandated recipients of CHIPS Act funding to complete federal environment reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act as a condition for receiving the funding. The move followed lobbying by the semiconductor sector, which argued the requirements would further delay the projects' completion.\n“We've actually seen some pragmatism out of the Biden administration in realizing that these chip fabs are not going to be built on this kind of timeline if they don't start accelerating things,” Reva Goujon, a director at Rhodium Group, told Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-07-10T12:16:43.000Z",
        "article_content": "We recently published a list of the Analyst Says These 10 Stocks Can Benefit if Donald Trump Wins US Election 2024. Since Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) ranks 9th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWolfe Research said in a note earlier this month that the odds have shifted in favor of Donald Trump following the first presidential debate. However, the firm believes we can see several “unexpected twists and turns” ahead. Wolfe Research also shared a list of stocks that could be potential winners should Donald Trump become the President of the US.\nWhat could happen if Donald Trump becomes President of the US has been a topic of debate and discussion on Wall Street over the past several months. In late January, when the Russell 2000 index jumped,  Zhiwei Ren, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management, reportedly said that investors might be flocking to the “Trump Trade.” The Russell 2000  is a small-cap U.S. stock market index that makes up the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. Ren said, according to Wall Street Journal, that since Trump is a supporter of low interest rates and less regulation, small-cap stocks, which thrive under Dovish economic policies, were reacting positively to the increasing chances of Donald Trump becoming the leading Republican candidate for the upcoming elections.\nIn this article, we first scanned Wolfe Research’s basket of stocks the firm believes could be potential winners in case of a Trump presidency. From these stocks we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) is expected to deliver about $2 billion in EBITDA growth by 2026. Dow’s business is exposed to market cycles and interest rates. Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) thrived when interest rates fell to near-zero levels in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "date": "2024-09-09T14:41:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "The 2024 U.S. presidential election is approaching quickly and everyone’s wondering how the outcome might impact financial markets, including the price of gold. Of course, many factors influence gold prices, but political shifts can create some ripple effects.\nRead Next: I’m an Investor: I’m Making These Money Moves Immediately If Trump Wins\nFor You: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\nGOBankingRates spoke to experts to find out how a Trump win could potentially affect gold prices.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nMatthew Jones, precious metals analyst at Solomon Global, believes that any major political change can create uncertainty in financial markets. “Uncertainty often leads to volatility, and both are known to be big price drivers for gold,” he said.\nJones points out that Trump is known for his divisive nature and that there is “concern and uncertainty around his economic, inflation and monetary policies.”\nTrump’s approach to deregulation might affect investor confidence. And their confidence, or lack of it, could have an impact on gold prices. Jones thinks a Trump win could lead to “a mix of policy-driven uncertainty, inflation, and geopolitical risks,” which could increase the demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. This higher demand would mean a higher price.\nBrandon Thor, CEO of Thor Metals Group, offered a more nuanced perspective. He believes that a Trump victory would initially “breathe optimism into the markets as Wall Street knows Trump is staunchly pro-business.” This could lead to a temporary dip in gold prices and an increase in stock values. Thor also believes that underlying economic issues won’t disappear overnight.\nCheck Out: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: 3 Items That Will Instantly Get More Expensive\n“We are still sitting on a currency that has been printed with reckless abandon and a national debt that is untenable to say the least,” Thor said. He argues that the market gains during Trump’s previous term were partly due to “artificial reasons” such as stimulus checks and debt accumulation, which may need to be corrected.\nThor suggests that Trump’s options for preventing a market correction would be limited. “Trump’s only defenses against a market correction are bullying the Fed into lowering rates or pumping money into the market in an effort to stimulate it,” he said. However, Thor warns that such actions could lead to a crash in the dollar’s value and accelerate inflation.\nDavid Materazzi, CEO at Galileo FX, has views that largely align with Jones’ and Thor’s on how Trump’s plans could crank up inflation. “His love for loose monetary policy, relentless spending, and pushing the economy into overdrive will ignite inflation, weakening the dollar,” he said. He added that when the dollar sinks, gold typically rises in value.\nMaterazzi also points to geopolitical factors, saying that “the chaos his trade wars and geopolitical tensions cause – uncertainty always drives people to gold.” He admits stocks might get a temporary boost from deregulation and tax cuts. But ultimately, Materazzi believes the national debt will continue to rise, which will fuel more long-term gold demand.\nJulia Khandoshko, CEO at Mind Money, agreed that Trump’s victory may increase global instability. “His projects to combat migration, China, and interference in European politics will support gold,” Khandoshko said. Again, all of this will mean higher gold prices.\nKhandoshko also points out that even though the Fed is supposed to be its own boss, Trump might push harder for lower rates than the Dems would. This could create tension between the government and the Federal Reserve, possibly creating doubt around the stability of the U.S. dollar. When a currency seems unstable, people tend to turn to gold instead.If Trump successfully lowers interest rates, that could also fuel demand for gold. If interest rates are too low, investors might prefer gold to keeping their money elsewhere.\nJonathan Rose, founder of Prepper Bar and CEO of Genesis Gold Group, said that history doesn’t always play reruns. He pointed out that during Trump’s last term in the White House, gold prices took a leap. This might’ve been thanks to Trump’s trade disputes with China, along with some other strained international relationships.\nSo, if Trump wins again, could gold prices go up? Maybe, although Materazzi believes that no matter who wins in November, gold prices will continue to rise.\nRegardless, guessing where the market’s headed is like trying to predict the weather — and maybe even more complicated. Gold prices are dependent on many factors, not just American politics, and there are usually too many moving parts to make accurate predictions.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "Yahoo Finance is spending the final days of the 2024 campaign examining key economic decisions that, like it or not, will confront the next president. For an even deeper look at all of the financial issues that matter most to your pocketbook, please see Yahoo Finance’s interactive guide to the 2024 election.\nOne of Donald Trump's most remarkable accomplishments in office was how he reoriented the political landscape around trade and tariffs, ushering in a new era of higher duties that have persisted and even grown slightly during the Biden administration.\nThe decision facing voters in this election is whether he will be able to upend the status quo again.\nVice President Kamala Harris and her aides have offered little detail on her trade plans, but if she makes any moves at all, she is widely expected to keep the Trump-created new normal of higher duties in place — with a possible focus on new duties on \"strategic sectors.\"\nTrump, by contrast, is promising a new wave in the ballpark of 10 times the level of tariffs he put in place in his first term, experts said, with a plan that includes across-the-board tariffs of 10% or higher and 60% tariffs on China.\nHe is also promising things like a Trump Reciprocal Trade Act that would automatically put tariffs on nations in response to their duties on the US.\nThe effects would be felt across American life, even if Trump delivers on just a fraction of his promises.\nOne thing that appears off the table, at least for now, is a lowering of duties anytime soon.\n\"Cutting tariffs is not in the cards for anybody,\" Richard Baldwin, a professor of International Economics at the International Institute for Management Development, said in a recent interview.\nBaldwin added of Trump's promises that \"I think we have to take him at his word,\" noting that he has the power to levy his tariff regime unilaterally.\nDuring his term in office, then-President Trump imposed duties on a wide array of products from China as well as things like aluminum and steel products from Europe and Asia.\nIt marked about $80 billion in new duties, which companies pay at US ports of entry.\nThe Biden administration largely left Trump's tariffs in place and even announced new duties this May on \"strategic sectors\" such as semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nHarris is expected to continue this general approach and has unveiled a reindustrialization strategy aimed at encouraging specific sectors in the US — from aerospace to AI to quantum computing to critical minerals.\nHer focus has not been on any new tariffs at campaign stops but instead on government inducements for certain industries, similar to Biden-era accomplishments like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act focused on semiconductors.\nBiden's and Harris's aides have long pointed to a recent boom in US factory construction as evidence their approach is the one that works.\nHarris has also been critical of Trump's plans for new tariffs, likening them to a national sales tax that she said would add over $3,900 to a typical family budget, as companies that pay the duties pass along the tariff taxes to the final consumers.\nRead more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts\nBut the politics around tariffs could forestall any efforts to roll back existing duties, which notably poll well, especially in certain swing states.\n\"If she wins, she won't win because of California,\" William Alan Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a recent interview, citing Harris's home state where tariffs are less popular.\n\"She'll win because of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the trade politics there haven't changed,\" he added, noting the widespread support for existing duties on things like steel, aluminum, and autos.\n\"She brings a different mentality to the job,\" he said of her California background as well as of the selection of Tim Walz from agriculture-dependent Minnesota, which was hit hard during Trump's first round of tariffs.\n\"But it doesn't change the politics.\"\nWhen it comes to Trump, the former president has a record of keeping his trade promises and is pledging what would be historic duties.\nTrump calls tariffs \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" and has even floated things like 2,000% tariffs on autos and said his aim in some areas is to implement \"the highest tariff in history.\"\nPerhaps the only question, with Trump likely able to cut Congress out of the loop and pursue his policies unilaterally, is whether courts intervene.\nRead more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?\nA recent analysis from Reinsch and Warren Maruyama, a former general counsel at the US Trade Representative, laid out the extensive authorities that allow presidents to impose tariffs on their own.\nAnother analysis from Alan Wolff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics warned of underestimating Trump's tariffs. He noted the unilateral powers a president enjoys and the unprecedented levels tariffs could reach.\nThe effect \"on the economy, on businesses, and on individual consumers and workers would literally be incalculable,\" he wrote.\nThat leaves the courts, where past challenges to Trump's tariffs haven't been successful. That could change depending on how vigorously Trump tried to pursue a potential second-term agenda.\n\"No matter what he does, he'll be sued,\" Reinsch said, adding that perhaps the easiest legal path for Trump would be to begin with his plan for 60% tariffs on China.\n\"You declare an emergency, and you use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,\" he noted, adding, \"It works better when there's a targeted offender.\"\nBaldwin added that political repercussions could be the only check on Trump's agenda.\nHe predicts that only those 60% tariffs on China could \"lead to an inflation surge, especially on the middle class. That makes the last couple of years look like a small thing.\"\nAnd that's even before China retaliates, he added, which \"could do a lot of damage.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "A tech-led rally brought new record highs for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) Thursday as investors digested a fresh interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and Donald Trump's electoral victory.\nIn a widely expected move, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%.\nThe S&P 500 rose roughly 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite moved nearly 1.5% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs.\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded right around the flat line, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 8 basis points to 4.34%.\nSpirits still appeared buoyant after Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks.\nPowell was asked multiple times on Thursday about how an incoming Trump administration could impact the Fed's path forward.\n\"In the near term, the election will have no effect on our policy decisions,\" Powell said. When questioned whether he'd step down as Fed chair if asked to do so by Trump, Powell simply said \"no.\"\nDuring a roaring rally over the past two sessions, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. \nBut some of the market's biggest movers this week have once again been from the market's largest stocks. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — hit a fresh record high on Thursday.\nThe index is up over 8% over the last five days, outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 4.69%.\nPowell had a simple but poignant response when asked if he'd resign if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to step down.\n\"No.\"\nAll three of the major stock indexes were headed for record closes on Thursday as investors digested a subdued press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up more than 1.6% and shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs.\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022.\nEach average moved higher as Powell's presser ended.\nPowell dodged multiple political-focused questions during his press conference, which is unsurprising given that the election occurred less than 48 hours ago. It's also not a surprise considering his contentious relationship with President-elect Donald Trump.\nTrump, who frequently criticized Powell during his first term in office, had told Bloomberg in a July interview that he'd let the central bank leader serve out his term, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing,\" he said at the time.\nBut Trump has frequently flip-flopped his stance on Powell. Just a few months prior to the aforementioned Bloomberg interview, Trump said he would not reappoint the Fed chair, accusing the central bank leader of manipulating rates to give Democrats an edge in the election.\nOn Thursday, when asked if a sitting US president has the right to fire or demote a Fed chair or any of the Fed governors, Powell simply replied: \"It's not permitted under the law.\"\nThe latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed year-over-year price increases didn't fall in September.\nThe core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.7% in September, above Wall Street's expectations for 2.6% and in line with the 2.7% seen in August.\nBut during Thursday's press conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the Fed also looks at the three- and six-month annualized rates of Core PCE to identify trends. Our chart below shows the three- and six-month annualized rates are at 2.3%.\nBroadly, Powell said the data is showing \"that we really have made significant progress.\"\nSince the Fed began cutting interest rates, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose roughly 80 basis points to hit a recent high of about 4.47%.\nOn Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that move higher was likely not \"principally about higher inflation expectations.\"\nHe reasoned the move higher was more likely driven by better-than-expected economic growth.\nPowell later added that for higher bond yields to impact Fed policy they would need to see \"material changes in financial conditions that \"last\" and \"are persistent.\"\n\"We don't know that about these what we've seen so far,\" Powell said.\nIn a press conference that kicked off at 2:30 p.m. ET following the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the election results, noting the central bank will not make decisions based on expected policy changes from a new administration.\n\"In the near term, the election will have no effect on our policy decisions,\" he said. \"We don't know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be. We, therefore, don't know what the effects on the economy would be. Specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.\"\nCompared to the current Biden administration, Trump and his proposed policies have been viewed as more inflationary given his campaign promises of high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts, and curbs on immigration.\n\"We don't guess. We don't speculate, and we don't assume,\" Powell continued, adding that it's possible any administration's policies or policies put in place by Congress could generate economic effects that the Fed would address at that time if deemed appropriate.\nIn a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday.\nAfter a half a percentage point cut in September, Thursday's unanimous decision move brings the central bank's benchmark rate down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%.\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nThis new cut was justified, according to the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee, in support of its goals to maintain stable prices and full employment.\nHowever, the central bank removed language from its policy statement that the \"committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%,\" raising questions about the pace and number of future rate cuts.\nInstead the policy statement read: “the Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.”\nRead more here.\nThe Fed's next policy decision is less than 30 minutes away. Here's a look at where markets sit before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's closely followed press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.2% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs.\nBroadly, Big Tech led the market action, with all of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks up more than 1% on the day, led by more than 3% pop in Meta (META).\nIn bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 7 basis points to 4.35%.\nBelow is a look at the sector action for the day where Information Technology (XLK) is leading the way.\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president.\n\"They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down and not say anything all that new,\" said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust.\nStill, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one.\nFed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes.\nAnd there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, and those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions.\nRead more here.\nThe stock market's feverish rally following Donald Trump's presidential election victory may have just been an early appetizer for a strong few months of gains.\n\"Exuberance lies ahead,\" Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. \"President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response.\"\nEmanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A \"public reengaged in speculation,\" as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel.\nRead more here.\nYahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports:\nMortgage rates rose for a sixth consecutive week, following Treasury yields as they climbed higher through the presidential election.\nThe average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.79% through Wednesday, up from 6.72% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was essentially unchanged, to 6% from 5.99%.\nMortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs.\nRead more here. \nAbout 24 hours after Donald Trump won the presidential election, American CEOs are already weighing on how the president-elect's policies could impact their business.\nFor one, Trump's proposed increases on tariffs are expected to weigh on retailers. On Wednesday, Steve Madden (SHOO) CEO Edward Rosenfeld said his company has been “planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly.”\n“Our goal over the next year is to reduce that percentage of goods that we sourced from China by approximately 40% to 45%, which means that if we’re able to achieve that and we think we have the plan to do it, that a year from today, we would be looking at just over a quarter of our business that would be subject to potential tariffs on Chinese goods,” the shoemaker's CEO said.\nTrump's presidency is also expected to be less restrictive on mergers and acquisitions. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said Thursday Trump's second term could provide an opportunity for more consolidation in the media industry.\n\"We have an upcoming new administration, and it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different,\" Zaslav said on a call with analysts following the company's third quarter results.\nRaymond James analysts on Thursday downgraded shares of DHI (DHI), saying that in the wake of Trump's election win, they view mortgage rates staying “higher for longer” and constraining housing affordability.\nThe investment firm downgraded DHI to Market Perform from Outperform but kept the same price target at $195.00. It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026.\nDue to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients.\n\"Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added.\nThe bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability.\nNetflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election.\nThe stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets.\nThe moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names.\nThe streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%.\nAnd in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close.\nDisney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks.\n\"Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,\" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance.\nRead more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars.\nLyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations.\nLyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected.\nOn Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing.\n“LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH).\nStill, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.”\nLyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win.\nThe cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.'\nShares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory.\nBoth stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday.\nEarlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC).\nMeanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each.\nAnother batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning.\nModerna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year.\nHere’s a closer look at how the companies performed:\nHershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected\nModerna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected\nWarner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected\nMeanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses.\nStocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday.\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president.\nMeanwhile, parts of the \"Trump Trade\" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session."

        "article_content": "The name Donald Trump has been synonymous with money for decades, but the former president’s finances have never endured more scrutiny than today. A series of civil and criminal cases are sapping his fortune and threatening his business empire — and then, of course, there’s the little thing of funding a presidential campaign, which is one of the most expensive purchases money can buy.\nNet Worth: How Rich Is Former President Donald Trump?Check Out: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nBut how much will Trump spend in his mission to evict Joe Biden from the White House, reclaim his place in the Oval Office and become the first president since Grover Cleveland to win a second nonconsecutive term?\nGOBankingRates asked political finance and campaign experts to examine the likely cost of Trump’s campaign as America lurches toward its first presidential rematch since 1956, when Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson for the second time.\nSponsored: Credit card debt keeping you up at night? Find out if you can reduce your debt with these 3 steps\nLike any modern presidential candidate, Trump will have to produce a mountain of cash to fund his campaign.\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org — a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks money in politics — 2020 upped the ante dramatically in an already expensive process. Here’s what the presidential hopefuls have spent in all six 21st-century contests, including all money spent by candidates, political parties and independent special interest groups:\n2000: $1.4 billion\n2004: $1.9 billion\n2008: $2.8 billion\n2012: $2.6 billion\n2016: $2.4 billion\n2020: $5.7 billion\nAs you can see, the first showdown between Trump and Biden four years ago more than doubled the previous cycle’s spending, but where does all the money go?\nFind Out: Here’s How Much Every Living US President Is Worth: Where Does Biden Rank?\nAccording to OpenSecrets, the Donald J. Trump for President 2024 committee has spent more than any other candidate-affiliated group in the current election cycle — $54,022,758 as of Feb. 2, compared to $37,502,043 for Biden for President.\nBut where does it all go and what does it pay for?\n“Trump’s 2024 campaign is likely to incur significant expenses, including costs for advertising, travel, staff salaries and digital outreach efforts,” said Eliana Martiin, political finance analyst, campaign strategist and CEO of the political advocacy firm QualifyCandidates. “Previous campaigns have shown a willingness to invest heavily in these areas to maximize visibility and voter engagement.”\nAccording to OpenSecrets, this is how all combined presidential campaigns have spent their money so far in the 2024 election cycle:\nMedia: 24.23%\nFundraising: 19.44%\nAdministrative costs: 15.35%\nUnclassifiable expenses: 14.65%\nSalaries: 13.71%\nCampaign expenses: 6.31%\nStrategy and research: 6.29%\nWith nearly one dollar in five spent to raise more dollars, getting supporters to dig deep is the name of the game.\n“Fundraising will play a crucial role in financing Trump’s campaign, with an emphasis on grassroots donations, high-dollar fundraisers and online contributions,” said Martiin. “The campaign’s ability to mobilize financial support from its base will be a key determinant of its overall budget.”\nBut that’s shaping up to be a much heavier lift for Trump in 2024 than it was in 2020.\nAccording to Forbes, Trump’s litany of legal bills and civil judgments have topped a half-billion dollars so far, and the GOP candidate is scrambling to meet impending deadlines to secure bonds and/or put up the cash needed to file appeals himself. Other cases and lawsuits with potentially huge penalties are on the horizon, interest is accruing daily on some judgments and if Trump can’t or won’t pay, authorities can seize and sell his properties and other assets in some cases.\nSo what does Trump’s legal drama have to do with his campaign? Everything, because the latter is picking up the tab for the former.\nAccording to the Associated Press, “Donald Trump’s legendary ability to raise massive sums of political cash may be on a collision course with a new and unpleasant reality.”\nAt the end of January, the Washington Post reported that Trump had spent $55 million in donor money not on his campaign, but on his legal bills. Even many die-hard supporters who were willing to spend their limited dollars to help Trump get elected balk at the prospect of paying a billionaire’s lawyer bills.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the result is that the Trump campaign spent more than it raised in January, putting even more pressure on outside groups already buckling under the weight of his legal expenses. Politico reported that overall, the Trump campaign spent more than it received in all of 2023. The AP reports that Trump took in less than $14 million in January — a pittance by modern presidential campaign standards — compared to Joe Biden’s $42 million in the same period. That leaves Trump’s two committees with $36.6 million in cash on hand compared to Biden’s $132 million war chest. Bloomberg predicts that at this rate, Trump’s cash-crunched campaign will run out of money by July.\nThe best way to project the cost of 2024 is to look back at 2020, the most expensive presidential campaign in U.S. history.\n“When expenditures and debt incurred by the 2020 Trump campaign committee are added to expenditures by outside groups, the 2020 Trump campaign cost approximately $2.24 billion,” said Michael Montgomery, a political scientist and former U.S. diplomat who advises nonprofit institutions on fundraising and resource development through his Montgomery Consulting firm and teaches part time in the Department of Health and Human Services at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. “To replicate the 2020 Trump campaign would cost $4.11 billion in 2024 dollars.”\nBut Trump does not have access to the same kind of cash or donor network today as he did four years ago.\n“At this point, the 2024 Trump campaign committee has raised $85 million and outside groups have raised $55 million for a total of $140 million, which is a long way from the level of funding that was available to the 2020 Trump campaign,” said Montgomery, who cited FEC reporting and OpenSecrets data. “My guess? Total 2024 election cycle expenditures by the Trump campaign and outside organizations supporting Trump will come in at no more than $3 billion, making the 2024 Trump campaign a much less elaborate and expensive when adjusted for inflation than he had in 2020.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Single Best Thing To Buy at Aldi in March 2024\n10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\nThis is One of the Best Ways to Boost Your Retirement Savings in 2024\n6 Things You Should Never Do With Your Tax Refund (Do This Instead)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Money Will Trump Spend on His Presidential Campaign in 2024?"

        "article_content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at These 10 Stocks Can Skyrocket if Donald Trump Wins US Election 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article These 5 Stocks Can Skyrocket if Donald Trump Wins US Election 2024.\nAfter his latest win in the South Carolina Republican presidential primary against Nikki Haley, Donald Trump looks all set for a rematch against President Biden in the November 2024 US Presidential elections. How would stocks react to Donald Trump's arrival in the White House? While there is ample research available on the behavior and performance of financial markets and stocks during Republican and Democrat governments, more are more analysts are weighing in on how 2025 and beyond would look like for the stock market if a new government is formed under Donald Trump.\nIn late January, when the Russell 2000 index jumped,  Zhiwei Ren, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management, reportedly said that investors might be flocking to the \"Trump Trade.\" The Russell 2000  is a small-cap U.S. stock market index that makes up the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. Ren said, according to Wall Street Journal, that since Trump is a supporter of low interest rates and less regulation, small-cap stocks, which thrive under Dovish economic policies, were reacting positively to the increasing chances of Donald Trump becoming the leading Republican candidate for the upcoming elections.\nHowever, some analysts also believe the age-old idea that stocks from certain industries (oil, defense, etc.) perform well under Republicans while others such as green energy outperform under Democrats is becoming outdated. A Bloomberg report published earlier this month cited Christopher Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, who said that dividing stocks in \"red\" and \"blue\" baskets before US elections is tempting but latest data shows the market has a tendency to give surprises. For example, according to an analysis by Harvey, defense and oil stocks have outperformed by more than 66% under the Biden administration, while clean energy stocks, which were expected to do well under Democrats, posted lackluster performance. Similarly, shares of Smith & Wesson, one of the top gun companies in the US, tanked during Trump administration.\nHowever, Donald Trump's win in the 2024 elections would shake the markets since Trump has said that he would not reappoint Jerome Powell as Fed chair and his policies of low interest rates and de-regulation could bring new challenges for the Fed in its battle against inflation.\nMethodology\nLast month, Goldman Sachs published a list of stocks and sectors that can outperform if Republicans come to power in the 2024 elections.  For this article we chose some notable stocks from this list, mentioning reasons behind their possible outperformance under a Trump presidency. In addition we also consulted several analyst reports and credible financial websites to see which companies are set to outperform under Donald Trump if he wins the 2024 election. We picked a few stocks as a result of this research. Some top names in the list include JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\nDigital World Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ:DWAC) is a Trump-linked SPAC which recently came in the limelight after the SEC declared effective the registration statement for its proposed merger with Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the company behind Truth Social, an alternative social media platform that claims to encourage \"open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating on the basis of political ideology.\"\nDigital World Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ:DWAC) and other Trump-related digital properties and companies could see a huge boost if Donald Trump comes to power after the November 2024 elections.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 7\nFounded by US army veterans who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, Utah-based Black Rifle Coffee, or BRC Inc (NYSE:BRCC), has a history of having a pro-Trump, pro-right wing stance on different political and cultural matters including immigration. The coffee company BRC Inc (NYSE:BRCC) has received public endorsements from Sean Hannity and Donald Trump Jr. in the past. The stock is seen as one of the top names to have exposure to during a Donald Trump-led Republican era. Over the past one year the stock has lost about 37%.\nIn November 2023, BRC Inc (NYSE:BRCC) disclosed that its director Kathryn Dickson bought 30,000 class A common shares in BRC Inc (NYSE:BRCC) at $3.27.\nA total of seven hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in BRC Inc (NYSE:BRCC).\nLike BRCC, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) are also positioned to benefit from a Donald Trump presidency.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\nGoldman Sachs in its report last month said engineering and construction company Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR) could gain if Donald Trump comes to power because of the Republicans' plans for tighter borders. Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR) was one of the companies involved in border construction activities during the previous tenure of Donald Trump.\nThe company talked about its guidance and future plans during Q4 earnings call earlier this month:\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\nVALE S.A (NYSE:VALE) is one of the stocks Goldman Sachs believes could gain if Donald Trump comes to power.

In addition to Vale, hedge funds also like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX).\nLast month, VALE S.A (NYSE:VALE) said it produced 89.4 million metric tons of iron ore in the fourth quarter, crushing past the 83 million metric tons estimate.\nDuring Q4 earnings call Vale talked about 2024 plans:\nRead the complete earnings call transcript here.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\nAmerican coal mining company Peabody Energy Corp (NYSE:BTU) could skyrocket during Donald Trump's presidency amid expectations that Republicans would reverse Joe Biden's green energy initiatives and encourage traditional, fossil fuel energy policies.\nLast month, Goldman Sachs also named Peabody Energy Corp (NYSE:BTU) among its list of stocks that could be winners if Republicans come to power later this year.\nClick to continue reading and see These 5 Stocks Can Skyrocket if Donald Trump Wins US Election 2024.\nSuggested Articles:\n13 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Analysts\n11 Most Promising Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks According to Analysts\n16 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts\nDisclosure. None. These 10 Stocks Can Skyrocket if Donald Trump Wins US Election 2024 was initially published on Insider Monkey."

        "date": "2024-06-14T11:02:04.000Z",
        "article_content": "As the 2024 presidential election looms, many people in the U.S. are contemplating the potential impacts of another trip for Donald Trump to the White House, particularly where finances are concerned. Beyond the political and social implications, the money moves made at the top trickle down to your daily grind in terms of grocery, gas and utility bills.\nIf Trump secures the presidency for a second time despite any court convictions, how hard will it hit your wallet?\nAlso here is what a second Trump presidency could mean for your debt.\nRead More: Trump-Era Tax Cuts Are Expiring — How Changes Will Impact Retirees\nSee Next: 4 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\nThe Donald Trump administration’s first term was marked by a mix of deregulation, tax cuts and a robust stock market, which supporters argue spurred economic growth. However, critics point to increasing income inequality, a burgeoning national debt, volatile trade policies and the skyrocketing average costs of goods. A second term would likely continue many of these policies, with specific implications for necessary household expenses.\nHere are a few key takeaways: \nThough technically gas prices were generally cheaper when Trump was in office, his policies had really nothing to do with what you paid at the pump and lots of people thinking that gas or energy prices would decrease during a second presidential term would likely be disappointed.\nIf you have been trying to figure out why your grocery budget is out of control, it’s probably because food costs increased by 25% between 2019 to 2023. This food budget doesn’t even factor in eating out at restaurants which have also gone up exponentially.\nYou may not realize that utilities, including electricity, have high dividends that are derived from steady costs and a stable operating system. Even with less-than-ideal interest rates, they maintain a worthy investment, but how a Trump win would affect your monthly electricity bills remains unclear.\nAny executive order Trump claims he will make if reelected alleging to lower inflation is not likely backed by projected economic statistics.\nExplore More: 5 Unnecessary Bills You Should Stop Paying in 2024\nOne of the hallmarks of Trump’s economic policy has been his aggressive stance on trade. His administration implemented tariffs on various goods, particularly those from China, aiming to protect American industries. However, these tariffs often led to higher costs for imported goods, including food items.\nIn 2025, this could mean your credit card will be doing some heavy lifting at your local grocery store if Trump stays consistent with these policies or even intensifies certain tariffs. If this isn’t part of your thrifty plan to cut food costs you can hope that if he does win he’ll negotiate more favorable trade deals to help reduce food costs. Domestic agriculture could even benefit from fewer competitors, potentially lowering some grocery prices, but supply chain disruptions could counteract these gains.\nSome things Trump tried to implement included support for biofuels and deregulation, which might benefit farmers if reimplemented in 2025. However, trade wars previously hurt farmers, leading to the need for government bailouts.\nA supportive agricultural policy could stabilize or lower some grocery costs. However, if trade tensions rise again, farmers could face export challenges, potentially driving up prices for domestic consumers.\nTrump has consistently advocated for energy independence, promoting fossil fuel production, including oil and natural gas. His administration rolled back numerous environmental regulations to boost domestic energy production. This may be temporarily good for your finances but terrible for the environment.\nAn increased domestic production in 2025 could lead to lower gas prices if supply outpaces demand. However, global oil prices are influenced by numerous factors beyond U.S. control. Geopolitical tensions and global demand shifts could all affect prices at the pump. A less stringent regulatory environment might lower production costs, but environmental concerns and potential international backlash could complicate the picture.\nTrump’s skepticism towards climate change policies and his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement contrasted sharply with the previous administration’s focus on renewable energy.\nA continued focus on fossil fuels over renewables in 2025 might slow the transition to cleaner energy sources. This could maintain lower gas prices in the short term but might result in higher long-term costs due to environmental damage and potential climate-related regulations.\nTrump’s deregulation efforts extended to the energy sector, aiming to reduce costs for consumers and businesses. These policies often favored traditional energy sources over renewable ones, but what does that mean when it comes to how much it will cost you to run your air conditioning or enjoy your streaming services?\nShort-term reductions in utility bills could result from deregulated energy markets and increased production of natural gas and coal. However, this might come at the cost of long-term sustainability and increased environmental risks. The potential for regulatory rollbacks on renewable energy investments could slow the adoption of more efficient, cost-effective technologies.\nTrump has repeatedly promised significant infrastructure investments, which could include modernizing the energy grid. However, his first term saw mixed results in terms of actual implementation. Focusing on your personal finances and monthly bills is one thing, but seeing the larger impact is another.\nIf substantial infrastructure investments materialize if Trump gets elected for a second term in 2024, improvements to the energy grid could lead to more reliable and potentially cheaper utility services in 2025. Yet, the funding and execution of these projects remain uncertain, leaving their impact on utility bills in 2025 speculative at best.\nThe bottom line is that predicting the exact impact of a potential Trump presidency on grocery, gas and utility bills in 2025 involves navigating a complex web of policies and external factors outside just your wallet. A mix of continued deregulation, potential trade tensions and an emphasis on fossil fuels suggests a possible scenario of initially lower costs in some areas, counterbalanced by longer-term risks and uncertainties.\nYou should research and weigh these economic considerations alongside broader political, social and environmental factors before you head to the polls in 2024. The interplay of domestic policies and global economic dynamics will shape the financial landscape in the years to come, making it crucial for Americans to stay informed and engaged in the political process. Simply put, if you are going to put your money where Trump’s mouth is, it might not always be a predictable investment or even a wise one.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nI'm a Shopping Expert: 6 Things Retirees Should Never Put In Their Grocery Cart\nGraham Stephan: Here's When the Housing Crash Will Happen\n6 Things to Try This Week if You're Behind on Your Savings Goals\n3 Surprising Reasons Women Should Consider an Annuity\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: If Trump Wins In 2024, What Will Your Bills Look Like in 2025?"

The average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was essentially unchanged, to 6% from 5.99%.\nMortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs.\nRead more: Mortgage rates are still increasing — is this a good time to buy a house?\nBond yields surged an additional 16 basis points on Wednesday following Trump’s victory, before giving back some of their increase on Thursday to yield around 4.36%.\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates this afternoon, a move that is unlikely to affect mortgage rates in the coming weeks.\nStill, many housing market experts now expect mortgage rates to stay higher for longer.

        "date": "2024-11-21T15:00:45.000Z",
        "article_content": "You don’t need to look any further than the mercurial CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, to prove the maxim that “the rich get richer.” The world’s second-richest individual has seen his wealth grow by a whopping $70 billion in just a week since Donald Trump was re-elected to the presidency, thanks in large part to his ownership of 411 million shares of Tesla.\nThe stock soared roughly 39% in the week after the 2024 presidential election, as investors view Trump as much more Tesla-friendly than his defeated rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. But with the stock making such a dramatic move in just a few days, should you jump in and ride the wave, or is it too late? Here are some of the most important factors to consider.\nFind Out: 7 Tax Loopholes the Rich Use To Pay Less and Build More Wealth\nRead Next: 5 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\nTrending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nOne of the most interesting developments during the 2024 presidential campaign was the cozying up of fellow billionaires Donald Trump and Elon Musk. But this was no mere political friendship. Musk literally put his money where his mouth was, spending money to sign up right-leaning swing-state voters and even tossing millions of dollars directly to voters signing his American PAC petitions.\nIn spite of any personal feelings Musk might have for Trump, it’s clear that his strong support for the former president was intended to pay off for his various companies, including Tesla. There are currently 19 ongoing federal investigations and lawsuits against Tesla, X and SpaceX, and many if not all of those are likely to magically go away under the next Trump presidency.\nIn fact, Trump has appointed Musk head of a brand-new government department, “The Department of Government Efficiency,” which he has said will “dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.”\nWith these potential federal land mines out of the way, Tesla can potentially operate in a more profitable manner.\nSee More: I’m a Financial Advisor: 4 Investing Rules My Millionaire Clients Never Break\nBeyond the political cronyism, however, there are some analysts who paint a bullish portrait of Tesla simply on its fundamentals. Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, for example, envisions a potential scenario in which Tesla shares can reach $500 per share, about 50% above current levels.\nRecently, Jonas notes that Tesla posted better-than-expected earnings of 72 cents per share while profit margins jumped by two full percentage points. Musk himself added that he sees the potential for a 20% to 30% growth rate in 2025, barring any global calamities.\nLooking forward, however, Jonas sees a number of major contributors to Tesla’s bottom line, including the following:\nLicensing of the company’s driver-assistance technology\nBroader network and mobility services\nBattery, energy and insurance divisions\nFaster adoption rate of the company’s AI-powered Dojo supercomputer\nJonas says the company can hit its lofty target prices if it reaches 8 million in EV sales annually, 400 gigawatt-hours of energy storage and collective contributions from services, software and full self-driving technology.\nClearly, Tesla didn’t become 40% more valuable intrinsically in a matter of days. But the stock market is a forward-looking mechanism, and it may actually be true that the future Tesla is worth more than the stock bump it has recently received.\nBut plenty of caveats are attached to the bull case for Tesla. Analysts at Kiplinger caution investors to be wary of the stock after its huge runup, in spite of the fact that Tesla has dramatically outperformed the stock market as a whole over the past five years. The well-regarded financial publication notes that the stock has an extraordinarily high five-year beta of 2.3, meaning that it’s more than twice as volatile as the overall market, and it has a maximum all-time drawdown of 73%. Put it all together and even if you’re a Tesla bull, you should expect violent swings in the company’s stock price.\nTesla’s valuation has always been a cause for concern, and the company’s metrics seem even more out of whack after its stratospheric post-election rise. But if the company is free to operate as it chooses for at least the next four years while its CEO is the head of “government efficiency,” Tesla may continue to surprise to the upside. Investors should make sure their risk tolerance allows them to invest in the stock, however, as the only certainty is that shares will remain exceedingly volatile.\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "Investing.com -- As the U.S. presidential elections loom, the solar industry finds itself at a critical juncture.\nThe 2024 election results could have significant implications for the future trajectory of solar stocks and the broader clean energy sector.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022, has provided unprecedented support for the solar industry, leading to rapid growth in both investments and installed capacity.\nHowever, a potential shift in political power in Washington could bring changes to these policies, which investors and industry leaders are closely watching.\nAs per analysts at Evercore ISI, despite the election-driven uncertainties that may introduce short-term volatility, the U.S. solar industry remains on a strong growth path.\nThe IRA's provisions, particularly the generous clean energy tax credits, are a crucial driver of this growth.\nThe Act's clean energy credits, estimated to total between $800 billion and $1.2 trillion over the next decade, have been instrumental in propelling solar energy to become the leading source of new power generation in the U.S. Evercore ISI projects over 250 GWdc of solar installations between 2024 and 2029, with annual growth averaging around 4%.\nThe impact of the election hinges on which party takes control of the executive and legislative branches.\nA Democratic victory, with President Biden or a candidate from his party in the White House, would likely ensure the continuation of the IRA's incentives for solar and other clean energy sources.\nEvercore ISI analysts believe that even if a Republican candidate like former President Donald Trump were to win, a complete repeal of the IRA is unlikely, especially given the bipartisan support for job creation in the renewable energy sector.\nIndeed, red states have been some of the largest beneficiaries of the IRA, with more than $120 billion in clean energy investments since 2021, including $10.9 billion in solar projects.\nIf Republicans gain control, they may attempt to modify certain provisions of the IRA. For example, there could be a shortening of the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit programs, or changes to the transferability of these credits.\nHowever, Evercore ISI expects that most of the current legislation will remain intact due to the widespread economic benefits, especially in Republican-dominated states where solar investments have surged.\nAdditionally, any efforts to dismantle the IRA would face opposition not only from Democrats but also from a growing number of Republicans, particularly in districts that have seen significant solar-related job growth.\nOn the stock market front, solar companies could experience different outcomes depending on the election results.\nEvercore ISI points out that companies like First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), which has a U.S. manufacturing presence, are well-positioned to benefit from continued or heightened tariffs on Chinese imports, regardless of who wins the election.\nFirst Solar's recent expansions in Alabama and Louisiana underscore its strength in the domestic market, where tariffs are likely to favor the U.S.-based manufacturers.\nMeanwhile, residential solar firms such as Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) and Sunnova might face headwinds if changes to the ITC are implemented, although Evercore ISI considers this scenario unlikely.\nA key factor that could influence solar stocks in the post-election period is interest rates.\nResidential solar, in particular, has been affected by higher interest rates, which have dampened consumer demand.\nIf interest rates continue to decline, as some analysts expect, this could provide a boost to residential solar firms.\nHowever, the uncertainty surrounding the election could lead to market volatility in the short term, as investors assess the potential for policy changes that could impact the solar sector's profitability.\nRelated Articles\nHow U.S. elections could shape the solar stocks and industry\n5 big analyst AI moves: Nvidia stock has 40% upside left; Cisco upgraded to Buy\nGQG Partners sells BBVA stake over Sabadell hostile bid, FT reports"

        "article_content": "Regardless of who wins the November election, some stocks are likely to rally while others fall. But the stock market as a whole is likely to rise over the full term of the next president. This is based on historic data going back to 1945, which shows that the market has posted good average annual gains under both Republican and Democratic presidents.\nCheck Out: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell\nUp Next: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nThis doesn’t mean, however, that there won’t be short-term market volatility both before and after the actual election, nor does it mean that certain sectors aren’t more likely to rise than others. After all, Donald Trump already served one term as president, and the policies he enacted then are likely to continue or even be amplified under a potential second term.\nWith the acknowledgement that no one can predict short-term market movements with any certainty, here’s a look at the best educated guesses as to what you can expect if Trump wins the presidency.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nOver the short term, bonds are likely to continue rallying regardless of who wins the presidency. This is because the Fed just began its campaign of interest rate cuts in September 2024. As this will likely continue into 2025, it’s perfectly reasonable to expect bond prices to trend higher over that time period, as market interest rates and bond prices have an inverse relationship. But some economists fear that a renewed and even amplified trade war under a second Trump term could eventually push up inflation, forcing the Fed to reverse course and ultimately begin raising interest rates once again.\nAt the level of the market itself, a survey of Bloomberg terminal users suggests that more investors would dump bonds under a second Trump term than if Harris wins the White House, which could erode bond prices and help drive interest rates higher.\nRead More: 5 Ways To Pick Your Next Investment, According to Experts\nOne of the clear distinctions between the two candidates in the 2024 election is in the area of renewable energy. Whereas Trump wants to roll back billions in federal tax credits and subsidies for the clean energy industry, Harris wants to funnel more money into it. This makes these stocks particularly vulnerable to a Trump victory.\nThe housing market is likely to rally under a Harris presidency, as the current VP has voiced support for a significant bump in home building and tax credits and down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. But if interest rates rise under a Trump presidency, due to potentially rising inflation as a result of boosted tariffs on China, this could hurt any gains in the housing industry.\nOne of the signature policies of Trump’s first term was higher tariffs on China. If Trump serves a second term, he may slap an additional 60% tariff on Chinese goods, on top of the 25% levels already in place. Whereas industries with ties to China may enjoy a relief rally under a Harris presidency, they may suffer greatly under a second Trump term. Whether or not Trump actually enacts those tariffs or not, in the short term, stocks with ties to China are likely to take a hit if Trump wins the election.\nAlthough some stocks may suffer if Trump wins a second term, others are much more likely to benefit. These could include companies in the defense, steel, prison, fossil fuel and banking industries. This is based on Trump’s proclivity to enact “America first” policies, particularly toward the banking and defense industries, and his focus on law and order and eliminating regulations in industries such as steel, banking and fossil fuels.\nFor investors, one of the benefits of Trump running for a second term is that he already has a four-year track record in place. Looking at how the stock market performed under Trump’s first term may give an indication as to what to expect under a potential second term.\nFrom the day of Trump’s inauguration in 2017 through his final day in office, the S&P 500 index gained 67%. That’s relatively close to the first-term performance of both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, during which the S&P 500 posted returns of 85% and 79%, respectively.\nThis data demonstrates that over the long run, the U.S. stock market is very resilient and seems to perform well regardless of who is in the White House. For this reason, long-term investors may wish to ride out any short-term volatility if Trump wins a second term and simply continue to invest consistently over time.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

Thus they aren't expecting interest rates to come down as quickly as traders currently expect.\n\"We're not going to see interest rates as low as people are forecasting,\" BlackRock’s Fink said.\nThe Fed is expected by traders to lower interest rates next week by another 25 basis points and then again in December, following an initial 50 basis point cut in September. The September cut was the first in more than four years, following an aggressive campaign by the central bank to tamp down inflation.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nBut when asked by one moderator Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to raise their hands if they expected the Fed to bring rates down by a further 50 basis points this year, not one finance boss on a panel did so.\nThe group included Carlyle (CG) CEO Harvey Schwartz, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick, and State Street (STT) CEO Ron O'Hanley.\n\"Inflation is more embedded in the global economy than the current narrative,\" Solomon said. \"That doesn't mean that it's going to rear its head in a particularly ugly way, but I do think there's a potential, depending on policy actions that are taken.\"\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday at an annual convention held by the American Bankers Association that he also is worried about the return of rising inflation.\n\"Inflation, in my view, may not go away so quickly,\" he said, pointing to longer-term trends that suggest it could rebound as it did during the 1970s.\nPart of the inflationary concern from Wall Street is that US government spending under either party will keep rising.\nBoth Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump have proposed economic policies on the campaign trail that could add trillions to the US debt, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, although Trump’s policies would add more.\n\"We're dealing with significant deficits and actually strong economic conditions,\" Carlyle’s Schwartz said Tuesday.\nRowan with Apollo cited the government's increase of defense production and two landmark laws passed during President Joe Biden's term as examples of actions that are \"stimulative\" and \"inflating.\"\n\"I'm trying to remember why we're cutting rates.\"\nAt this same event last year, many of the same CEOs were much gloomier about the global economy’s near future.\nThey were still waiting to see the impact of high interest rates on the US economy as the geopolitical environment was growing increasingly hostile.

        "article_content": "Billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros has been the target of controversy recently after a recent move to become a controlling shareholder in the second-largest owner of radio stations in the U.S.\nThis isn't the first media brand Soros has bought a substantial stake in, but it worries some people going into the 2024 election. Last year, Soros bought a substantial stake in Vice Media Group. Vice was once worth nearly $6 billion, but Soros bought a stake in the company for pennies on the dollar following its surprise bankruptcy in 2023. The deal valued Vice at roughly $350 million with Soros owning an undisclosed stake in the company.\nDon't Miss:\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can co-invest in at $1.15 per share.\nFortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\nAudacy, the No. 2 U.S. radio broadcaster behind iHeartMedia, recently filed for bankruptcy. The company owns 227 major radio stations in 27 states and 45 cities across the U.S. These include some of the biggest channels in New York; Memphis and Chattanooga, Tennessee; Denver; Washington D.C., Miami and Orlando, Florida; Atlanta; Baltimore, Maryland; Wichita, Kansas; Austin, Dallas and Houston, Texas; Richmond, Virginia; and many major cities across California as well as several other prominent markets across the U.S.\nThe bankruptcy plan, which would convert debt purchases into equity ownership, saw Soros purchase roughly 40% of Audacy's debt, according to The New York Post. While that isn't a true 51% controlling stake, it's likely to be one of the largest, if not the largest, stakes in the company potentially giving the Soros Fund effective control of Audacy, The Post reported in February.\nTrending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\nSome have voiced concerns about this purchase going into the 2024 election. Soros is a well-known political advocate for left-leaning politicians and is often one of the largest donors to such politicians in countries around the world. Soros donated over $140 million to political causes in 2021 and $170 million to the 2022 mid-term elections.\nThis influence on the U.S. political system has caused speculation about his control over politicians and elections for many years. Some fear this acquisition could be used as a campaign tool at the local and regional levels or to influence the upcoming 2024 election. The New York Post's article details one conservative voice close to the deal describing the transaction as \"scary.\"\nWhile there are several other entities involved in this transaction, it's unclear who will have effective control or whether there will be a noticeable impact on any of the radio stations. Soros has conducted hundreds of billions of dollars in business deals and acquisitions over the decades, with many of them to provide a return on investment (ROI) to his investors.\nSome brands have shown the ability to be owned by interested parties while still maintaining a semblance of journalistic integrity. Amazon.com Inc. Founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post when it was in decline in 2013. After an infusion of capital and a much-needed bailout, the company has continued to thrive in recent years. Despite being owned by Bezos, The Washington Post has, on occasion, not shied away from criticizing its billionaire owner.\nWhile it's unclear what implications this will have on radio stations across the U.S. or the 2024 election, it's likely to draw continued speculation and controversy going into the election this November.\nRead Next:\nLong overdue disruption in the moving industry is underway.

        "article_content": "With Kamala Harris as a late addition to the upcoming presidential race, there’s a rush to learn about her policies, particularly those surrounding the economy. Harris’s economic platform and policies mirror Biden’s, so the economic impact is likely similar to what was expected had Biden become the Democratic nominee for president.\nNext: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for the Job Market If Kamala Harris Wins the Election\nAlso: 6 Subtly Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nHarris has not been shy about her economic priorities. In a speech to the American Federation of Teachers on July 25, 2024, she said, “In our vision of the future, we see a place where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead – a future where no child has to grow up in poverty, where every senior can retire in dignity, and where every worker has the freedom to join a union.”\nHere are some of Kamal Harris’s campaign platform’s major economic planks and how they will impact the national economy.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Child Tax Credit was expanded from $2,000 to $3,000 per child, with an extra $600 for children under six in 2021. This reduced child poverty to 5.2%, a historic low. In 2022, when the pandemic relief expired, child poverty surged again to 12.4%.\nThe Biden administration has supported restoring the tax credit to 2021 levels since it has been proven to slash child poverty rates. But the bill to do so has not passed the Senate. Harris may make the passage of this bill a priority for her administration.\nI’m an Economist: Here’s What Could Happen to Wage Workers if Kamala Harris Is Elected in 2024\nAs a California senator, Harris proposed the LIFT the Middle-Class Act, or Livable Incomes for Families Today. This bill proposed a tax credit of up to $3,000 per person for middle and low-income workers. This would have reduced the income tax paid by $3,000 per person or $6,000 per couple for those who meet the income threshold. Harris proposed this bill in 2018, and the cost of living has significantly increased since then.\nHarris may not propose LIFT again as president, but she would likely sign a similar proposal if it were passed by Congress.\nHarris has even more enthusiastic support from labor unions than Biden did and rapidly picked up endorsements from the American Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International Union, and the granddaddy of them all, the AFL-CIO.\nUnder the Biden administration, labor unions have been able to secure higher wages and better benefits for their workers, and more workers have been able to unionize. This seems likely to continue and even expand in a Harris administration.\nIn addition to her widely publicized support for abortion care and women’s bodily autonomy, Harris has also expressed her commitment to protecting the Affordable Care Act and increasing subsidies. She’s also a supporter of expanding Medicare in those states that have not already done so.\nMuch has been said during this election cycle about the precariousness of Social Security benefits. With the country’s aging population and large numbers of Baby Boomers retiring every day, many voters are concerned about the ability of this system to provide income for them when they need it.\nHarris supports the Biden administration’s position against cutting Social Security benefits and against privatizing Social Security. She has also said that she will increase the cost of living adjustments so that benefits more closely align with the needs of seniors today.  In order to provide the funding needed for these policies, Harris has suggested revising the current limit on earnings that are subject to social security tax, now set at $168,600. Harris would require earnings above $250,000 per year to also be subject to Social Security tax.\nA cornerstone of Biden’s platform has been the promise not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year, and Harris plans to continue that pledge. In order to pay for her ambitious social service programs, taxes will have to be raised on those earning over $400,000 per year, or about 3% of taxpayers.\nLike Biden, Harris supports measures that will support middle-class families. Years of so-called trickle-down economics have failed to deliver the promised gains, so Harris hopes to reverse that trend by increasing taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations to fund programs that improve the quality of life of middle — and lower-income families.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "date": "2024-09-21T16:39:34.000Z",
        "article_content": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Voting ended in Sri Lanka's presidential election Saturday as the country seeks to recover from the worst economic crisis in its history and the resulting political upheaval.\nThe election, contested by 38 candidates, was largely a three-way race among incumbent liberal President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Marxist-leaning lawmaker Anura Kumara Dissanayake and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa.\nThere were no major incidents reported during the vote but authorities declared a countrywide curfew until Sunday morning as a precaution, police said.\nThere are 17 million eligible voters, and final results are expected Sunday.\nThey will show whether Sri Lankans approve of Wickremesinghe's leadership of a fragile recovery, including restructuring Sri Lanka's debt under an International Monetary Fund bailout program after it defaulted in 2022.\nThe government announced Thursday that it passed the final hurdle in debt restructuring by reaching an agreement in principle with private bond holders.\nAt the time of its default, Sri Lanka’s local and foreign debt totaled $83 billion. The government says it has now restructured more than $17 billion.\nDespite a significant improvement in key economic figures, Sri Lankans are struggling with high taxes and living costs.\nBoth Premadasa and Dissanayake say they will renegotiate the IMF deal to make austerity measures more bearable. Wickremesinghe has warned that any move to alter the basics of the agreement could delay the release of a fourth tranche of nearly $3 billion that is crucial to maintaining stability.\nVoters hope for an end to instability\nMost Sri Lankans voted with the economy in mind, hoping a new government will lead the way out of crisis and end entrenched corruption.\n“I think corruption is one of the main reasons that led the country to the present pathetic condition. So, the next leader should pay attention to eliminate corruption and start building the country,” said Chandrakumar Suriyaarachchi, a driver who voted in Saturday's election. \"Our children deserve a better life.”\nPolitical experts say widespread disenchantment with the political old guard — widely blamed for Sri Lanka's economic instability — could mean no single candidate is able to secure 50% of votes as a first preference. In that scenario, the top two candidates move to a second round of counting that takes into account second-choice votes.\nThere are concerns that if a clear winner fails to emerge, the island nation could plunge into more instability.\nVoter Visaka Dissanayake said he hopes Sri Lanka votes for a “strong leader, who will set the path for economic recovery.\"\n“We have now come out of a very difficult situation. So, I hope the economic recovery will continue,” Dissanayake said.\nRajapaksa political dynasty casts a long shadow\nSri Lanka’s economic crisis resulted largely from excessive borrowing on projects that did not generate revenue. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government’s insistence on using scarce foreign reserves to prop up the currency, the rupee, contributed to the economy’s free fall.\nThe economic collapse brought a severe shortage of essentials such as medicine, food, cooking gas and fuel, with people spending days waiting in line to obtain them. It led to rioting in which protesters took over key buildings including the president’s house, his office and the prime minister’s office, forcing then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.\nWickremesinghe was elected by a parliamentary vote in July 2022 to cover the remainder of Rajapaksa’s five-year term. Now, Wickremesinghe is seeking another term to strengthen the gains.\nHowever, many people accuse him of protecting members of the Rajapaksa family, whom they blame for the economic crisis.\nWickremesinghe, who was the only member of his party in Parliament, was elected mainly with the votes of Rajapaksa loyalists. They also supported him as members of his Cabinet and in voting for the reforms he proposed.\n___\nAssociated Press video journalist Rishi Lekhi contributed to this report."

        "title": "Bacon hogs the spotlight in election debates, but reasons for its sizzling inflation are complex",
        "date": "2024-10-10T13:46:19.000Z",
        "article_content": "She blames greedy companies for price-gouging. He blames the Biden administration’s economic policies.\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump agree on one thing: Tapping into sour consumer sentiment about high grocery prices is one way to court voters.\nBacon prices have been a particular focus for Trump. He mentioned them in his Sept. 10 debate with Harris and again a week later during an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press.”\n“Things are not going, right now, very well for the consumer,\" Trump said during the interview. “Bacon is up five times.”\nTrump's math is wrong, but bacon has seen some sizzling price increases. According to federal data, U.S. bacon prices peaked in October 2022 at $7.60 a pound, up 30% from October 2019.\nIn September, bacon averaged $6.95 a pound, 25% higher than five years ago. That's in line with a 29% increase in overall food prices over that period, according to the Labor Department. Still, September bacon prices were 1.8% lower than they were a year ago.\nPrices for bacon are always volatile. Among other things, they're subject to weather, animal disease, feed costs, seasonal demand and, according to Harris and other critics, some price gouging by giant food conglomerates.\nBacon prices typically go up in the summer when Americans have a hankering for BLTs, for example. A president's policies generally have little direct impact on the prices consumers pay for bacon or food overall.\nPrices for not just bacon but groceries in general — and most other products — began surging in 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed from the pandemic recession, causing snarled supply chains and goods shortages. The price spikes worsened later after Russia invaded Ukraine. Food costs jumped across the world, not just in the United States.\nThough U.S. inflation has tumbled from its peak in mid-2022, average food prices remain elevated. The impact of those price spikes, though, has been cushioned in part by a comparable rise in average wages.\nHere are some factors that have made it more expensive to bring home the bacon.\nCOVID-19 spread quickly in meat processing\nWorkers stand close together on production lines in the U.S. meat processing industry. Big bacon producers like Smithfield Foods and Tyson Foods temporarily closed plants in the spring of 2020 after thousands of workers got sick and some died. While plants were closed, millions of pigs got too big to be processed and were culled instead, leading to shortages just as home-bound Americans were shopping for more breakfast bacon, said David Ortega, a professor of food economics at Michigan State University.\nDemand from China jumped\nChina's growing demand in 2020 contributed to lower pork supplies at home. U.S. pork exports to China jumped 75% in 2020 as Beijing scrambled to replace hogs that were lost to an outbreak of African swine fever, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nOver the course of 2020, U.S. bacon prices rose 6%.\nMeat processors faced higher costs\nMeat companies paid out pandemic bonuses and invested in protective gear in order to get plants running again. Tyson Foods required all its 139,000 workers to receive COVID vaccines.\nBy the end of 2021, Tyson said it had spent more than $800 million on bonuses, vaccine clinics and other COVID-related measures. It was also paying more for packaging and transportation in a supply chain that had been mangled by COVID. To recoup those costs, the company jacked up the prices of pork products by 25% in its 2021 fiscal year.\nLabor costs took a toll\nAfter risking their lives to keep working during the pandemic, many workers sought better pay and benefits. In June 2021, unionized workers at a Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, threatened to strike after contract negotiations broke down. The coronavirus killed four workers at the plant and infected nearly 1,300.\nSmithfield Foods, which is owned by the Chinese pork company WH Group, eventually agreed to higher wages and $520 bonuses for its Sioux Falls workers. U.S. bacon prices rose 24% over the course of 2021.\nMoscow's war against Ukraine sent prices up\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 caused global wheat and corn prices to surge. That made it costlier to raise hogs. According to Iowa State University, feed costs rose 24% between 2021 and 2022. Early in 2022, Brazil-based JBS, another major U.S. pork processor, said it was raising prices to cover the higher cost of animal feed.\nDid corporate profits play a role?\nHarris has proposed a ban on “price gouging” by food companies, arguing that some of the companies kept raising prices long after pandemic-related supply problems dissipated so they could boost their profits.\nThere's no strict definition of “price gouging,” though it generally refers to sharp price increases that companies impose after a supply disruption. Three big bacon producers — Tyson, Hormel and JBS — reported record sales in 2022, when bacon prices hit a peak of $7.61 a pound.\nEventually, those higher prices reduced demand. In the year ending Oct. 1, 2022, U.S. consumers bought 8% fewer packages of bacon than in the prior year, according to Nielsen. By the end of the 2022, prices were falling.\nOver the course of 2022, U.S. bacon prices fell 3.7% to $6.95 a pound.\nAnimal welfare law had an effect\nIn 2018, California voters approved a law requiring more space for breeding pigs, egg-laying hens and veal calves. Producers in other states must meet those standards if they want to sell pork, eggs or veal in California. The pork industry sued, supported by the Biden administration. But the U.S. Supreme Court declined to overturn the law, which took effect on July 1, 2023. Because not all pork producers are meeting the standards, less bacon is available to Californians, thereby driving up prices.\nDaniel Sumner, a professor of research and agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis, estimates that prices for pork products will be 7% to 10% higher in California over the long term because of the law.\nThe election raises uncertainty\nJoe Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute and a former economist for the USDA, said food price inflation was a global issue over the past few years, not one caused by the Biden administration. Past run-ups in food prices, he noted, have occurred regardless of which party was in office.\nOne wild card this time is Trump's promise to impose a 20% tariff on everything the U.S. imports. Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University, noted that the U.S. generally exports between 20% and 25% of its pork, and other countries would likely retaliate by imposing tariffs on U.S. pork. If that happened, more pork might remain in the U.S., which would cause bacon prices to fall. Yet the price of dozens of other imported products would rise.\n“If you want a BLT, the bacon may be a little cheaper, but the lettuce and tomato will cost a fair amount more,” Hart said.\nHarris has denounced Trump’s proposed sweeping tariffs, though she has supported targeted tariffs on Chinese imports.\nHarris has vowed to crack down on unfair mergers that give big food companies too much pricing power. She's also said she would investigate and prosecute price-fixing, an ongoing issue in the heavily consolidated meat industry. McDonald's recently sued four big beef companies, including Tyson and JBS, accusing them of price-fixing."

        "date": "2024-10-24T15:45:22.000Z",
        "article_content": "Dave Ramsey, the renowned financial advisor and radio host, has made headlines with his surprising endorsement for the 2024 U.S. Presidential race. Ramsey, known for his straightforward advice on personal finance and money management, announced that he is supporting former President Donald Trump and he’s not mincing words about it.\nAccording to a report from Fox Business, Ramsey explained his reasoning on a recent episode of The Dave Ramsey Show, breaking down the key policies that influenced his choice.\nDon't Miss:\nAccording to Vanguard’s Advisor’s Alpha Study, working with a financial advisor can result in approximately 3% higher net returns annually, here are the benefits of partnering with a financial advisor and how to find the right one near you in minutes.\nMany are using this retirement income calculator to check if they’re on pace — here’s a breakdown on how on what’s behind this formula.\n\"Where am I most likely to get a tax policy that I like? Where am I most likely to get an immigration policy I like? Where am I most likely to get a foreign policy I like? Where am I most likely to get a gun policy I like? A climate change policy I like? A woke policy I like? That I agree with,” he stated.\n“So I’m going to tell you, I’m voting for Donald Trump because I checked those boxes and more of them are on that side than the other.”\nGiven Ramsey's estimated net worth of $200 million, many people aren’t surprised by this stance. As a high-income earner, Ramsey benefits from policies like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, pushed by the Republican administration.\nHe expects future cuts to federal income tax rates across all brackets, with the most significant reductions benefiting wealthy Americans like himself. However, this policy has sparked criticism, as the individual and corporate tax cuts under TCJA are estimated to have added about $1.9 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nSee Also: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor.\nCritics argue that this burden will affect programs like Social Security and Medicare, two of the largest entitlement programs in the federal budget.\nThis public declaration was met with mixed reactions from his massive audience. Ramsey's show, which boasts over 18 million weekly listeners on platforms like Sirius XM, iHeartRadio and others, reaches a diverse crowd.\nSome might have been surprised by his endorsement, while others may have seen it coming. Regardless, Ramsey seemed unconcerned about potential backlash. “People have threatened me like, ‘I'm going to cancel you,'” he said with a chuckle. “That's hard to do. I own the show so you're not going to get to cancel me.”\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\nRamsey's outspoken support for Trump isn’t without context. In a recent interview with Trump titled “Can Trump's Plan Clean Up America's Financial Mess?” The two sat down for nearly 25 minutes to discuss key issues like inflation, U.S. energy independence, real estate and the general state of the economy.\nRamsey asked how the former president's policies could address America's ongoing economic challenges.\nWhile Ramsey has thrown his weight behind Trump, he's also expressed a willingness to engage with other candidates. A TikTok video indicated he had contacted Vice President Kamala Harris for a similar interview. \"I'll do the same thing with Vice President Harris if I get the chance,\" he wrote in a caption.\nMany financial experts believe Ramsey's endorsement could have an impact, given his influence over a large, financially minded audience. However, not everyone is on board with his choice. Critics argue that some of Trump's economic policies, particularly his tax cuts, disproportionately benefit the wealthy, while others question his approach to trade and foreign relations.\nRead Next:\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? – How does it compare to the average?\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "article_content": "Oppenheimer AM lifted its 2024 year-end price target for the S&P 500 from 5,900 to 6,200. This marks the third time this year the asset management firm has increased its price target for the index.\nToday's move represents a 3.4% increase from the S&P 500's closing level of 5995 last Friday, November 8. The increase came despite Oppenheimer maintaining its earnings projection at $250.\nThe firm initially set a year-end target of 5,200 for the S&P 500 in December 11 of last year, with an earnings estimate of $240. By early March, the S&P 500 had surpassed this target, closing above 5,200, leading Oppenheimer to raise its target to 5,500 and increase its earnings forecast to $250 on March 25.\nIn July, after the index again exceeded expectations by closing above 5,500, the firm boosted its target to 5,900 but kept its earnings projection unchanged.\n\"Last week’s decisive election result removed an uncertainty hanging over markets for some months,\" John Stoltzfus, Chief Investment Strategist at Oppenheimer AM, wrote in a client note.\n\"US stocks staged a “sigh of relief” rally while gold prices eased from their record highs of October. The Fed’s 25 basis point rate cut on Thursday also boosted investor confidence.\"\nInvestors responded to the reduced uncertainty post-election by favoring cyclical sectors such as consumer discretionary, financials, industrials, and information technology, while defensive sectors lagged.\nOppenheimer advises investors to exercise patience and avoid hasty conclusions about the impact of the election on the markets.\n\"Beyond trader induced momentum intermediate and longer-term investor sentiment, significant levels of cash reported to still remain on the sidelines suggests to us that the current bull market has legs to run through the end of the year notwithstanding any catalyst that could bring about some near-term selling and profit-taking by bears, skeptics, and nervous investors always ready to find opportunity to sell “without FOMO” midst a bull market that has and continues to show considerable resilience in dealing with uncertainties that might emerge in its path,\" Stoltzfus added.\nThe research firm recommends a strategy of broad diversification, focusing on enduring cyclical and secular trends rather than speculative bets based on the recent election outcomes.\nRelated Articles\nNovavax stock soars as FDA removes clinical hold on its COVID and influenza shot\nMicroStrategy acquired ~27,200 bitcoin for ~$2 billion in cash"

        "article_content": "Jim Rickards analyzes the potential economic and political impact of a Kamala Harris presidency and highlights key challenges for America.\nWASHINGTON, Aug. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nAs the 2024 Presidential Election approaches, former Vice President Kamala Harris is gaining momentum in the polls. This development has prompted former CIA advisor and economist Jim Rickards to share his perspective on what a Harris presidency could signify for the nation.\n\nJim Rickards: lawyer, economist, and ex-CIA\nHarris Presidency: Things Will Get Worse?\nRickards has highlighted several key indicators that suggest the U.S. economy could face significant challenges if Kamala Harris wins the presidency. Among these are:\nMarket Volatility: The financial markets are currently experiencing heightened volatility, reflecting investor uncertainty about the future. A Harris presidency could amplify these concerns, especially if her policies are perceived as unpredictable or overly progressive, leading to further market instability.\nRising National Debt: The U.S. national debt is already at unprecedented levels, and Harris’ potential policy initiatives, which may include expanded social programs and infrastructure spending, could exacerbate this burden. Without careful fiscal management, the increased debt could strain the economy and limit her administration's ability to respond to economic downturns.\nInflation Pressures: Inflation has been a growing concern, and Harris may face difficulties in curbing rising prices. Her administration’s potential focus on wage growth and social equity could inadvertently fuel inflation, making it harder to maintain price stability without stifling economic growth.\nDeepening Political Division: The country is more politically divided than ever, and Harris' presidency might deepen these divisions, particularly if her policies are seen as favoring certain groups over others. This could lead to gridlock in Congress, making it challenging to pass legislation necessary to stabilize the economy and address pressing issues.\nAll of these indicators point towards the Harris administration facing a complex and turbulent economic landscape.\nStaying Prepared for Uncertain Times\nGiven the potential economic and political challenges that could arise from a Harris presidency, Jim Rickards urges Americans to take proactive steps to safeguard their financial stability and personal security. Rickards stresses the importance of being well-prepared for any possible scenario.\n\"Preparation isn’t about fear—it's about prudence,\" Rickards emphasizes. \"In times of potential change and uncertainty, those who are prepared are better positioned to weather the storm.\"\nRickards has detailed these and other strategies in his latest brief, which is designed to help Americans navigate the potential challenges ahead.

        "article_content": "(Bloomberg) -- No billionaire did more to help Donald Trump win the US presidential election than Elon Musk. The Tesla Inc. and SpaceX boss will now find out whether it pays off, or if he ends up getting burned.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly\nArizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump\nScoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District\nKey Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration\nListen and subscribe to Elon, Inc. on Apple, Spotify, iHeart and the Bloomberg Terminal.\nMusk, whose growing political apparatus has already proved its mettle, will gain more than just an ally in the White House. Trump has vowed to give him an official role cutting government spending — and with it, the power to influence policy and the federal agencies that oversee his vast empire of companies.\n“He’s a character. He’s a special guy. He’s a super genius,” Trump said of Musk while addressing his supporters overnight. “We have to protect our geniuses. We don’t have that many of them.”\nAlready, shares in Tesla are surging. The stock soared as much as 15% in US trading as investors look to cash in on a Trump return to the White House. Musk also posted a chart early Wednesday morning that he said showed record usage of X, his social network.\n“Let that sink in,” he wrote in another missive, posting a parody photo of himself carrying a sink into the Oval Office — a nod to when he hoisted a sink into Twitter headquarters after taking over the social media company.\nIn the last few months, Musk was Trump’s most aggressive surrogate. The world’s richest man propped up Trump on X, hosted town halls in the critical state of Pennsylvania, and appeared at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally with even higher billing than the Republican’s own running mate, JD Vance.\nMusk spent more than $130 million on Trump and down-ballot Republicans in competitive House races, vaulting him to the highest echelons of donors this election cycle. On Election Day, Musk voted in Texas and then flew on his private jet to Florida to watch returns with Trump and his family at Mar-a-Lago. His PAC posted a photo of him sitting shoulder to shoulder with Trump and Dana White, the chief executive officer of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n“Musk is new to politics, but it means a lot for a billionaire and a tech mogul to go all in for President Trump,” said Jondavid Longo, the Pennsylvania state director of Early Vote Action, an organization dedicated to registering Republican voters. Trump’s win in Pennsylvania was key to his victory, helping him flip battleground states he’d lost in 2020 but won in his first run for president, in 2016. Musk donated $1 million to the group.\nSome voters were turned off by Musk’s aggressive financial involvement in the election.\n“I believe the election laws need to change so billionaires like Elon can’t buy the election,” said Suzie Bradrick, a registered Republican in Pennsylvania who voted for Harris on Tuesday. She was particularly upset that a Pennsylvania judge had voided a legal challenge to Musk’s $1 million giveaway.\n“I’ve never seen another billionaire campaign like that,” she said. “But it worked.”\nMusk has much to gain financially from the incoming administration. He oversees an empire of six companies, several of which are highly entangled with the US federal government. SpaceX has become an increasingly vital partner to NASA and the US Defense Department, with contracts worth billions. Tesla has staked its financial future on developing autonomous robotaxis, a risky pursuit facing serious regulatory hurdles.\nMusk’s personal fortune swung wildly during Biden’s four years in office, reaching as high as $340 billion and as low as $124 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Still, it has largely trended upward. As of Election Day, his net worth was $263.8 billion.\nDuring the campaign, Musk pitched a job for himself to cut government bureaucracy and waste. Trump heartily embraced the idea and regularly mentioned it on the campaign trail.\n“I’m going to get Elon. And he’s great at this. He’s going to be our cost cutter,” said Trump at a campaign rally in Michigan in late September. Trump has referred to position the “Secretary of Cost Cutting,” while Musk has joked that he’ll lead a Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in a nod to the cryptocurrency he’s long promoted.\nMusk has claimed he could cut an unprecedented $2 trillion from the federal budget. He hasn’t specified the agencies he’d go after, but regularly rails against the regulators that oversee his companies. During a long diatribe on the Joe Rogan podcast this week, he described a SpaceX rocket that sat on a launchpad for two months waiting for approval.\n“We could build the rocket faster than they could approve the paperwork,” he said. “It’s like Gulliver being tied down by a million little strings. It’s not like any one string is the problem but you’ve got a million of them.”\nA broad remit would give the Tesla, SpaceX and X boss leverage to reshape federal agencies that both regulate and have the power to investigate his many companies. He’s already said he will try to use whatever power he gets to push for a federal approval process of fully autonomous vehicles. Current rules prevent manufacturers from putting more than a couple thousand cars on the road per year without steering wheels or other controls.\nIt’s not uncommon for US presidents to tap executives and business leaders to fill their administrations. During his first term, Trump appointed Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who had been his campaign’s finance chair, to be Treasury Secretary. Musk’s potential role cutting government spending isn’t expected to be a Cabinet-level position, meaning he wouldn’t be required to step away from his CEO duties.\nAlready Musk’s support has influenced the president-elect. After the billionaire’s endorsement in July, Trump changed his tune on electric vehicles, going from entirely railing against what he called “crooked Joe’s insane electric vehicle mandate” to praising EVs at times.\n“I’m for electric cars. I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly, Elon. So I have no choice,” Trump said during an August rally.\nTrump also embraced Musk’s ambitions of reaching Mars using SpaceX rockets by 2028, or by the end of the Republican’s term. “We will land an American astronaut on Mars. Thank you, Elon. Thank you. Get going, Elon,” Trump said at an October rally.\nMusk’s policy interests go beyond those that benefit his companies. Like Trump, he’s pushed conspiracy theories and misinformation about immigrants to his more than 200 million followers on X.\nBut it’s one thing to campaign together; it’s another to work together. The president-elect is known for turning on even his most loyal friends and colleagues. Musk and Trump may be aligned for now, but points of tension could arise between two men known for their egos.\nOn EVs, for example, Tesla has received billions from President Biden’s policies, which Trump has vowed to dismantle. The two own rival social media companies, and not too long ago, Musk was calling for Trump to “hang up his hat and sail into the sunset.”\nWhatever happens between the two, Musk will leave this election cycle with a robust political machine that he can use to not only bolster his businesses, but also his pet policies.\n“America PAC is going to keep going after this election,” Musk said on an X Spaces Tuesday. Musk said the group is “preparing for the midterms and any intermediate elections at the district attorney and sort of judicial levels.”\nMusk’s America PAC, which spent $153 million on behalf of Trump, now has contact information from scores of voters, which it can use going forward.\nDemocrats painted Musk as their billionaire foil, echoing a Harris campaign warning that Trump’s “buddy Elon Musk is spending huge sums of money on his own ads hammering the Vice President.” They beseeched voters not to let the richest person on the planet buy the election.\nThose pleadings were to no avail.\n--With assistance from Brian Chappatta.\n(Updates with new voter quote starting in paragraph 9)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Winning Bet on Crypto Could Transform Brain and Longevity Science\n‘I’m Suffering’: What the 2024 Election Taught Me About America\nThe Crypto World’s Victory Lap Begins\nWhat Trump Can Do to Workers’ Biden-Era Gains\nWhy the Washington Commanders Are the Most Exciting Team in the NFL\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

        "article_content": "With President-elect Donald Trump’s historic and unprecedented win in the 2024 presidential election, it’s safe to say America will undergo several significant policy changes when his term begins in 2025. One issue that seems to be of high concern to many voters? Grocery prices and the inflation that drives them.\nRead Next: 5 Best Kirkland Grocery Items Retirees Should Buy at Costco Before Winter Hits\nLearn More: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nAmerican shoppers have noticed that food and grocery prices have been a rising expense, with NBC News reporting that the average cost of groceries has risen 22% over the past four years and food banks are hitting record numbers of people requiring assistance. Meanwhile, inflation rates spiked in 2022, but have settled back to their historical groove of 2-3%.\nHow will the incoming administration impact our current grocery prices?\nFor You: 10 Dollar Tree Items To Stock Up on for Thanksgiving 2024\nAs the Pennsylvania Independent reported in September, Trump plans to lower grocery prices by instituting tariffs on food imports.\n“We allow a lot of farm product into our country. We’re going to have to be a little bit lie other countries.  We’re not going to allow so much — we’re going to let our famers go to work,” Trump announced in a Michigan town hall at the time.\nTariffs are taxes placed upon imported foreign products, and the companies importing those goods pay those taxes. However, because those tariffs costs the importers more money, they then in turn raise the prices of their goods.\nWhat does that mean for the average American shopper? If Trump goes through with his tariffs plan, grocery prices will likely go up, rather than down, according to most economists — at least in the short term.  This is especially an issue with food products, as American farmers and fishers aren’t able to speedily increase production of food to counteract the import price hike. While it’s possible that their eventual production increases will level out grocery prices, in the near future, if Trump commits to his tariff plan, prices will likely rise on such imported items like coffee and certain fruits, like bananas.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Moves For Building Lasting Wealth: What Smart Americans Are Doing Right\nThe Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Retirees Should Make Before Inauguration Day\n3 Reasons Retired Boomers Shouldn't Give Their Kids a Living Inheritance\n5 Side Hustles That Can Earn You an Extra $1,000 Before 2025\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How President-Elect Trump’s Win Could Impact Grocery Prices"

        "article_content": "The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that the global economy is on pace for a soft landing this year and 2025 but elections around the world introduce a \"high\" level of uncertainty to that outlook due to potential changes in trade and fiscal policy.\nThe IMF said an increase in global tariffs could exacerbate trade tensions, disrupt global supply chains, and weigh down medium-term growth prospects by limiting positive spillovers from innovation and technology transfer that once fueled growth in emerging markets and developing economies.\n\"The level of uncertainty surrounding the outlook is high,\" according to the IMF. \"Newly elected governments (about half of the world population has gone or will go to the polls in 2024) could introduce significant shifts in trade and fiscal policy.\"\nIn the US, tariffs are a key part of Donald Trump's agenda should he be elected president in November. Tariffs are taxes that are paid by importers at points of entry, with the additional costs levied on these companies often passed on to consumers.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nThe IMF estimates in its new World Economic Outlook report that global growth will tick down to 3.2% in 2024 from 3.3% in 2023 and hold at 3.2% next year. The outlook is nearly unchanged from the spring of 2024.\nGrowth is projected to be higher than previously thought in the US and China this year while Europe also recovers. The IMF noted that global inflation is retreating, largely thanks to the effects of higher interest rates imposed by central banks.\nGlobal inflation is expected to decrease this year and next due to a broad-based decline in core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Core inflation is expected to drop by 1.3% this year, following a 0.1 percentage point drop last year.\nThe IMF raised its outlook for the US economy by 0.2% in 2024 due to strong increases in wages and robust consumer spending, resulting in growth of 2.8% for the year.\nBut the IMF expects growth in the US to slow to 2.2% next year as the job market cools and consumers slow spending. That’s slightly more optimistic than the Federal Reserve’s forecast for growth of 2% next year.\nIn Europe, the IMF sees growth picking up this year to 0.8%, before rising a bit more by 1.2% next year, helped by stronger domestic demand.\nChina’s economy — weighed down by property weaknesses and languishing consumer confidence — is projected to see a gradual slowdown. Better-than-expected exports are predicted to fuel GDP of 4.8% this year, 0.2% higher than previously forecast.\nChina’s government’s efforts to stimulate the economy could offer another boost, according to the IMF.\nStill, a litany of risks could derail global growth — from a deeper contraction in China's property sector to renewed spikes in commodity prices as a result of climate shocks, regional conflicts, or broader geopolitical tensions.\nLooking ahead, economic growth in the medium term is expected to be anemic given a combination of lower growth and constraining high debt, according to the IMF.\nOver the remainder of the decade, global growth is expected to remain broadly flat — decelerating from 3.3% in 2023 to 3.1% by 2029 — and is largely unchanged from the IMF’s forecast in April 2024 and October 2023.\nStructural challenges such as population aging, weak investment, and historically low total factor productivity growth are still holding back global growth.\nFor many advanced and emerging economies, the five-year forecast is weaker than the one-year forecast, suggesting that headwinds to growth will persist over the medium term.\nThe IMF, as a result, is calling on countries to get their fiscal houses in order. Fiscal deficits and government debt are still above what they were before the pandemic, and debt service costs remain high and rising in many countries.\nThe IMF expects the US fiscal deficit to be only marginally trimmed, remaining at about 6.1% in 2029, with about half of this reflecting interest rate expenses. Under current policies, the IMF sees US public debt as not stabilized, reaching almost 134% of GDP in 2029.\nIn the euro area, on the other hand, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to have stabilized already at about 88% in 2024, although with some cross-country differences.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump's historic guilty verdict on falsifying documents could lead to increased market volatility, experts warn.\nBut that’s not necessarily bad news for investors.\nEd Yardeni of Yardeni Research told me on Yahoo Finance's ‘Catalysts’ that it’s an opportunity for investors to buy.\n“Any sell off in the market related to a geopolitical crisis or a domestic political crisis may actually turn out to be a buying opportunity,” Yardeni said. “The market will continue to focus on what is most important, and that's the economy, and if politics affect that, then that will obviously have an impact on the stock market.”\nInvestors may be looking at Friday’s soft market reaction and think the Trump verdict doesn’t matter. But the calm may be short-lived.\n22V Research senior managing director Kim Wallace told me that as the election begins to fully come into focus, the VIX — known as the fear gauge index — will “likely get a strong bid” by mid-summer, as the market begins to give clues on how it will react to various election outcomes.\nFor some perspective, Goldman Sachs strategists Dominic Wilson and Vickie Chang wrote in a recent note that during the prior two elections, the summer convention season “provided one of the first broad market-moving events of the election cycle.”\nThe Republican National Convention is set to get underway July 15 in Milwaukee, followed by the Democratic National Convention in Chicago August 19.\nSo far this year, the VIX has been muted. The CBOE Volatility Index closed below 12 for the first time since 2019 last month, and remains well below its historical average of 19.9.\nWith about five months until election day, investors are beginning to assess which candidate is better for stocks.\nThe market seems to be cheering on the probability of a Trump victory this fall, according to analysis from LPL Financial's chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist. The correlation between the S&P 500 and Trump’s chances of winning the election has notably increased over the last few months.\nConversely, President Biden’s election odds have remained negatively correlated to the market since February.\nComparing investor sentiment to past performance, the market has historically done better with a Democratic president. Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told me earlier this year that the S&P 500 gained an average of 11.5% when a Democrat was in the White House, versus 7.1% for a Republican.\nAccording to industry experts, major policy areas with market implications include fiscal policy, tax and regulations, and geopolitics.\nIf campaign promises are a guide, a win for President Biden in November will likely lead to further investments in clean energy and manufacturing, expanded healthcare coverage, and lower prescription drug costs.\nPotential market-moving policy shifts under Trump include an extension of the 2017 tax cuts, promises to “unleash the production of domestic energy resources,” and plans to impose a 10% tariff on most imports and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports — which Wall Street and policy experts tell Yahoo Finance could worry markets and boost inflation.\n“Trump is largely seen as the best candidate for the markets because of his deregulation agenda, but there is real fear about what will happen from a trade policy perspective,” BTIG policy research director Isaac Boltansky told me.\nEvercore ISI’s Sarah Bianchi, who served as deputy U.S. trade representative under Biden, warns the market has not yet priced in any “Trump 2.0 trade war risk,” but this could change if he continues to lead in the polls.\n“We believe Trump 2.0 would mean the return of trade-related market volatility and we would not be surprised to see markets start pricing some of that risk soon,” Bianchi wrote in a note.\nWhoever wins the election, Berkshire Hathaway's billionaire CEO Warren Buffett is still likely to focus on super long-term investing — the same goes for his son.

Republicans closed in on the Democratic advantage of early and mail-in voting. Voters primarily relied on TV news channels for election coverage, followed by social media, and are split on whether coverage was biased. Looking ahead to the new administration, voters are divided on perceptions of Trump but want him to prioritize tackling inflation.\n\"This was an election about issues, and the economy and immigration played the biggest roles. Trump won on a clear message of middle- and working-class economics,\" said Mark Penn, Co-Director of the Harvard CAPS / Harris poll and Stagwell Chairman and CEO. \"But while he's won over people up to 54% and Republicans are supportive of his policies, he has to be careful in over-projecting his mandate – underneath is still a division of the election that has not yet resolved itself.\"\nTRUMP +2 ON HARRIS IN FINAL POLLING; +4 AMONG INDEPENDENTS\n50% of voters say they voted for Trump, including 92% of Republicans and 49% of Independents; while 48% of voters say they voted for Harris, including 90% of Democrats and 45% of Independents.\n82% of voters say they voted (Democrat: 86%; Republican: 87%; Independent: 70%). Non-voters cited lack of motivation, feeling like their vote didn't matter, and dislike of the candidates as top reasons they did not vote.\n37% of voters voted in-person on Election Day, 32% voted in-person before Election Day, and 31% voted by mail. 56% of the electorate say they made up their mind on who they were voting for before September. 34% of Democrats, 28% of Republicans, and 32% of Independents voted by mail.\n11% of the 2024 electorate were first-time voters. 31% of first-time voters decided who they were voting for before September, 24% decided the week of the election, and 20% decided on Election Day.\n74% of voters voted on down-ballot races (House of Representatives: 62%; U.S. Senate: 52%; Governor: 34%).\nVOTERS MOTIVATED BY ISSUES AND CHANGE\n80% of voters say the candidate's position on issues was the most important factor when it came to casting their vote compared to personal qualities (Harris: 71%; Trump: 90%; Democrat: 76%; Republican: 87%; Independent: 78%;).\nThe majority of voters said their response to the most important issue facing the country was a main reason for their candidate choice. Of those who said immigration was the most important issue facing the country, 87% said it was one of the main reasons, if not the main reason for their vote (abortion: 79%; inflation: 77%; climate change: 66%). 29% of voters said inflation was the main reason for their vote, 28% pointed to immigration, and 26% pointed to abortion.\n76% of voters say they voted for change rather than continuity in how the country is managed (Harris: 60%; Trump: 91%; Democrat: 62%; Republican: 89%; Independent: 78%).\nOf key events from the presidential campaign, voters say the Trump vs. Harris debate (36%), Trump surviving the assassination attempt (32%), and Trump declaring no tax on tips (32%) made them more likely to vote for Trump.\nTRUMP AND GOP APPROVAL RATING REFLECT ELECTION RESULTS AND DISCONTENT WITH DIRECTION OF COUNTRY, INFLATION, AND IMMIGRATION\nTrump's approval rating as president-elect is at 54%, 12 points higher than Biden's as president, including 91% of Republicans and 49% of Independents. The majority of male, 18-54 year old, white, Hispanic, urban, and rural voters approve of Trump.\n49% of voters approve of the Republican Party's job (+3 from October), while 44% approve of that of the Democratic Party (-3 from October).\n27% of voters say the country is on the right track, down 4 percentage points from October (Democrat: 29%; Republican: 32%; Independent: 17%).\nInflation (45%) and immigration (16%) continue to be the most important issues to voters personally, with inflation a concern across party lines, immigration of more concern for Republicans (28%), and abortion (18%) and climate change (13%) more of a concern for Democrats.\nPERCEPTIONS OF TRUMP STILL DIVIDED FOLLOWING THE ELECTION\n54% of voters say Trump has been trying to unify rather than divide the country since the election (Democrat: 24%; Republican: 89%; Independent: 50%).\n52% of voters believe Trump is a threat to democracy (Democrat: 81%; Republican: 16%; Independent: 45%). 53% say Trump should continue to be tried on criminal charges (Democrat: 87%; Republican: 16%; Independent: 55%).\n68% of voters say their greatest hope for the new Trump administration is to end inflation and price increases (Democrat: 57%; Republican: 81%; Independent: 68%), followed by the revitalization of the American economy (43%) and American values (42%).\n46% of voters say their greatest fear is Trump behaving like a dictator (Democrat: 74%; Republican: 16%; Independent: 49%). Other top fears among Democrats are irreparable damage to the U.S. government and agencies (56%) and the Trump administration moving too far to the right (55%). The greatest fear among Republicans is massive protests by the left (47%).\nOf Trump's cabinet appointments, more voters favor rather than oppose Susie Wiles (+11), Mike Huckabee (+6), Vivek Ramaswamy (+5), and Marco Rubio (+3). Voters are split on Elon Musk (+1) and oppose Matt Gaetz (-8).\nVOTERS FOLLOWED ELECTION NEWS CLOSELY, RELYING ON TV AND SOCIAL MEDIA; BELIEVE MUSK HAD BIGGEST IMPACT\n81% of voters say they followed the presidential election somewhat or very closely.\n46% of voters say they used TV news channels (Democrat: 45%; Republican: 49%; Independent: 42%), while 23% used social media platforms (Democrat: 26%; Republican: 22%; Independent: 20%) and 10% relied on news outlet websites.\nABC News (36%) and Fox TV News (33%) were the most popular TV channels for election coverage, while Facebook (43%), Google (39%), and YouTube (39%) were the most popular social media platforms for news.\n51% of voters say they felt election news was fair while 49% believe it was biased.

        "article_content": "The 2024 elections are the first US presidential elections of the generative AI era, and we’re already seeing examples of the technology being used to impact how Americans cast their ballots.\nOn Aug. 18, former President Donald Trump shared a series of AI-generated images of Taylor Swift fans wearing pro-Trump shirts, despite the fact that the photos originally appeared in a post marked as satire on X (formerly Twitter). In January, deepfake phone calls went out to some New Hampshire residents, attempting to discourage them from participating in the state’s Democratic primary.\nWith the election just a few short months away and generative AI detection technologies hit-or-miss, experts say we can expect to see more generative AI-based content designed to sow discord among the electorate.\n“The danger is that if there is a type of AI disinformation … like the Taylor Swift images … if millions of people are exposed to it and only 10% or 15% do not realize that that's fake, that could be a substantial number for thinking about elections,” explained Augusta University political science professor Lance Hunter.\n“[In] swing states, sometimes the margin of victory is less than 1%. So … a small number of people being exposed to this disinformation and not realizing it’s disinformation could be influential for election outcomes,” Hunter added.\nGenerative AI can be used to do more than create chatbots that answer your most inane questions. It can be used to produce images, recorded and live videos, and audio. And the incredibly fast proliferation of the technology means that people around the world can take advantage of it, including individuals and organizations seeking to use it for malicious purposes.\nIn fact, it’s already happened in countries including India, Indonesia, and South Korea, though it’s unclear whether they influenced voter outcomes. Still, there’s a real risk that phony videos or audio depicting either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris saying or doing something they never did could go viral and influence votes.\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) says it’s already on the lookout for potential threats related to generative AI.\n“Foreign adversaries have targeted U.S. elections and election infrastructure in previous elections cycles, and we expect these threats, to include the threat of foreign influence operations and disinformation, to continue in 2024,” Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of CISA, said in a statement to Yahoo Finance.\n“CISA provides state and local election officials and the public with guidance on foreign adversary tactics and mitigations, including addressing risks to election infrastructure from generative AI,” she added.\nThe problem with generative AI is that there are often few means of easily identifying whether content is made up or not. The technology has improved so quickly that it’s gone from generating images of people with 15 fingers to producing lifelike photos.\nLast July, the Biden administration already secured voluntary commitments from Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to manage potential risks posed by AI, but there’s nothing forcing the companies to abide by those agreements.\n“I think we probably will see bipartisan support at the federal level to create legislation to address this,” Augusta’s Hunter said. “Especially surrounding political campaigns, where that content can be taken down as soon as possible.”\nSocial media companies including Meta, TikTok, and X could also help prevent the proliferation of phony media intended to trick voters. That could include anything from clear labels identifying when something has been created using generative AI to a ban on AI-generated content.\nMore robust detection tools could also help web users better recognize generative AI images, videos, or audio, ensuring they aren’t suckered in by a convincing fake. But so far, identification software isn’t entirely accurate.\n“The detector tools are inconsistent. Some of them, frankly, are snake oil. They aren't typically geared to say certainly yes, certainly not,” explained Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University.\n“They're going to tell you there's an 85% chance. And that's good. That's helpful, but at moments of great polarization, that might not resolve something.”\nBut with the election fast approaching and generative AI advancing by leaps and bounds, there may not be enough time to prevent bad actors from taking advantage of technology to spread chaos online before voters begin casting their ballots. Whether that remains the case for the 2028 elections, however, is unclear.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "article_content": "US stocks slipped during a jittery session on Monday to kick off a week of potentially huge market-moving events — the presidential election and the Federal Reserve policy decision.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by about the same amount. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, falling about 250 points, or 0.6%.\nMonday's session was choppy ahead of Tuesday's election, a big risk event for markets. The new president — whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump — will set the course for the economy in the years that follow. The neck-and-neck race has investors bracing for volatility on Election Day itself.\nRead more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet\nWeekend polls showed Harris with a shock lead in Iowa and gaining ground elsewhere — a sign the Democrat has a better chance of winning than Wall Street had calculated. The dollar dropped by the most in a month as traders recalculated bets on a Trump victory. Treasury yields also retreated, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) sliding almost 10 basis points to about 4.30%.\nAlso looming large is the Fed's two-day policy meeting, kicking off a day later than usual on Wednesday in light of the election.\nWall Street is convinced that Chair Jerome Powell will usher in a 0.25% rate cut on Thursday, despite signs of stubborn inflation and muddied job market signals. Given that, the focus is on what action the Fed might take at future meetings, with the market now seeing three fewer cuts through the end of 2025 than it previously expected.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nIn other markets, oil prices jumped nearly 3% after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, decided to delay a planned hike in output by at least a month and Iran escalated Mideast tensions by warning of a \"crushing response\" to Israel's strikes.\nStocks fell during a choppy trading session on Monday ahead of the US presidential election.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down 0.6%, or roughly 270 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed down 0.3% after switching between positive and negative territories throughout the session.\nChip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) closed slightly higher but off its session high in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow on Friday.\n\"Trump trades\" were volatile during the session, with Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closing out the session 12% higher despite an Iowa poll over the weekend showing his contender, Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of former president Trump.\nThe markets were choppy on Monday as investors braced for Tuesday's US presidential election.\nMorgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson made some predictions on which sectors could lead, depending on the outcome.\nIn a Republican sweep scenario, in which Donald Trump wins and his party maintains control of the House and also gains the Senate, cyclicals such as Financials, Industrials, and commodity-sensitive industries could outperform and take the major averages higher, provided Treasury yields stay somewhat contained in the days following the outcome, Wilson and his team said.\n\"Conversely, if the move higher in yields is more material and is driven by a rising term premium due to fiscal sustainability concerns, we would expect more of a risk-off posture like the summer/fall of 2023,\" Wilson wrote.\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris wins and Congress is divided, Wilson sees \"tariff-exposed consumer equities and renewables outperforming in the short term\" while Financials, Industrials and commodity-sensitive industries could underperform initially.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 1% to hover around $67,800 on Monday as investors braced for the US presidential election on Tuesday.\nThe cryptocurrency has been viewed as a beneficiary if Donald Trump were to win the White House. The token moved beyond $72,000 last week, only to retreat after an Iowa poll over the weekend showed Vice President Kamala Harris leapfrogging ahead of Trump.\nThe former president has said in the past he will create a \"bitcoin national stockpile\" if reelected to the White House.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped into green territory by 1:45 p.m Eastern on Monday in what has shaped up to be a choppy session.\nThe tech-heavy index switched between positive and negative since early morning trading. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was helping lift the major average in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) later this week.\nThe AI chip heavyweight climbed more than 2% during the session.\nYahoo Finance's Grace Williams reports:\nThe 2024 presidential election is a day away, and with both candidates polling closely, speculation about a second Trump administration now heavily involves Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Specifically, if Musk will head up Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nIf that happens, “I think he will still be heavily involved with [Tesla],” Bank of America senior auto analyst John Murphy told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\nRead more here. \nEnergy (XLE) stocks outperformed on Monday as crude futures gained more than 2% following a decision by oil alliance OPEC+ to delay an increase in output.\nReal Estate (XRE) and Materials (XLB) also rose while Utilities (XLU), Financials (XLF) and Healthcare (XLV) dipped.\nStocks moved to session lows by mid-session on Monday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropping 0.4% after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Russia plotted to send incendiary devices on planes headed to the US and Canada. The report cited Western officials who said the devices that ignited in Europe were part of a plot to put them on cargo or passenger planes.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped from positive to negative territory to drop 0.3% immediately following the report.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 400 points, or almost 1%.\nNvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% Monday as analysts pointed to rising chip sales and mounting spending on AI infrastructure. That jump helped the AI chipmaker reach a $3.40 trillion market cap, according to Yahoo Finance data, again overtaking Apple's (AAPL) roughly $3.35 trillion.\nApple shares traded slightly lower midday, down 0.5%.\nNvidia had last dethroned Apple a little over a week ago, but Apple briefly retook the crown — before its earnings weighed on the stock.\nNvidia's rise comes after a week of ups and downs, as Big Tech's earnings shone a spotlight on AI capital expenditures. Investors fear that spending coud ease in the coming years as infrastructure projects reach completion, weighing on AI chipmakers.\nWall Street analysts have largely remained bullish on AI hardware stocks, seeing infrastructure spending by Big Tech continuing to rise. Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill said Monday that they expect Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) to spend a combined $292 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2025, representing an 88% increase from 2023 expenses.\nMeanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note Monday that global semiconductor sales grew 7.6% in September — \"a bit above typical\" — from the prior month.\nRasgon said of Nvidia: \"The datacenter opportunity is enormous, and still early, with material upside still possible.\"\nPeloton (PTON) shares rose 9% on Monday after Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock to a Buy from Neutral amid optimism over the fitness equipment maker's new leadership.\n\"Peloton's new CEO Peter Stern does not have public company CEO experience but meets all the criteria set by Peloton's board\" including consumer software and hardware experience and subscription services, the analysts wrote.\nStern, an avid Peloton user who comes from Ford (F), will start his CEO role on Jan. 1.\nConstellation Energy (CEG) stock fell as much as 12% early Monday amid a broader decline in nuclear power stocks following the US government's rejection of another Big Tech nuclear power agreement late Friday.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a proposal from a grid operator, PJM, to ramp up the amount of power supplied through the grid from Talen Energy (TLN) to an Amazon (AMZN) AI data center. Talen said in a statement on Sunday it believes the FERC \"erred\" in its ruling, adding the company is \"evaluating our options, with a focus on commercial solutions.\"\nTalen Energy dropped 9% in early trading, while Sam Altman-backed Oklo (OKLO) fell 8%, Centrus Energy (LEU) tumbled 19%, NANO Nuclear (NNE) dropped 10%, Vistra (VST) sank 4%, and NuScale Power (SMR) fell 7%.\nEven with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500.\nRead the full story here.\nTrump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) fell around 2% in early trading on Monday after initially opening the day in the green. Shares are bracing for another volatile week on Wall Street just one day ahead of the presidential election.\nThe stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday.\nAnd since Tuesday, more than $4 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock still has more than doubled from its September lows.\nPrior to the recent sell-off, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had risen in recent weeks as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory.\nPrediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican.\nRead more here. \nUS stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for this week's US elections and a Federal Reserve policy meeting.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flat line, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points.\nNvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the artificial intelligence chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also gained on Monday amid surging oil prices.\nInvestors are focused on Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential election, as well as on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policymakers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points.\nAffordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market.\nA new report showed that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers.\nHigh home prices, elevated borrowing costs, and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging.\n“In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance.\n“At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added.\nMortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers.\n“If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said.\nOil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other countries, said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024.\nThe decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.\nEconomic data: Factory orders (September), Durable goods orders (September)\nEarnings: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B), Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), Constellation Energy (CEG), Goodyear (GT), Hims & Hers (HIMS), Marriott International (MAR), Palantir (PLTR), Wynn (WYNN)\nHere are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning:\nWhy banks are (probably) rooting for Donald Trump\nDJT slides as Trump Media traders get set for Election Day\nHarris or Trump to shape US energy debate — but maybe not decide it\nOil rises as OPEC+ delays output hike, Iran steps up rhetoric\nFrom stocks to crypto, investors are bracing for election swings\nNvidia CEO asked SK Hynix to speed up supply of HBM4 chips\nTrump could send already-high tariffs into the stratosphere"

        "title": "Harris-Trump polls tighten, but PredictIt and Polymarket tell a different story",
        "date": "2024-10-14T17:39:16.000Z",
        "article_content": "The highly anticipated U.S. presidential election is just 22 days away, and polls show an increasingly tighter race. Two national polls released Sunday show an ultra-close race with Vice President Kamala Harris just barely in the lead, while a third poll shows her tied with former President Donald Trump.\nBut prediction markets tell a different story. PredictIt shows Trump’s campaign in the lead as the 2024 presidential election winner. It also has the GOP winning the presidency and the electoral college margin. As of Monday afternoon, Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction marketplace, also shows Trump has a better chance of winning the election on Nov. 5.\nWhile prediction markets have been around for a while, they’ve grown in popularity—especially for political events. These betting sites allow traders to buy and sell shares on the outcome of a given event, like whether Trump will get impeached or Biden will leave the presidential race.\nTraders then buy shares depending on which outcome they think is more likely. Share prices or “odds” rise and fall depending on demand. If the event happens the way the trader predicted, the contract or “bet” will rise to $1 and pay out—or fall to $0 if it does not.\nPrediction markets can be a more sophisticated and accurate way to foresee political events, Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune’s Shawn Tully. Miller is renowned for his accurate predictions during the 2020 election, and much of his methodology comes from examining prediction markets.\n“Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,” he told Fortune.\nWhile polls tell you about how people responded in the recent past, the odds on sites like PredictIt and Polymarket show real-time sentiment and are better for mapping the future, according to Miller. Plus, polls don’t show who will win the electoral college, while traders on prediction markets can wager on its outcome.\nThree national polls released Sunday show Harris’s lead is slimming.\nLast month, an ABC/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed Harris with a six-point lead over Trump. But that gap has closed to 50% support for Harris to 48% for Trump. A CBS/YouGov poll shows Harris up 51% to 48%, down from a four-point lead last month. And NBC’s poll of registered voters shows a complete tie between Harris and Trump, both at 48%.\n“As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,” Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, told NBC. “The race is a dead heat.”\nMeanwhile, Polymarket shows Trump has a 54% chance of winning the presidential election with Harris trailing behind at just a 45.3% chance.\nPredictIt’s markets are a little closer. For the market called “Who will win the 2024 US presidential election?” the “yes” outcome for Trump is currently at $0.54 and the “yes” outcome for Harris is $0.50.\n“If you wanted a single best predictor, one source of information to know what’s going on in the elections, it’s the prediction market,” Harry Crane, a statistics professor at Rutgers University, told CNN. “Any given piece of information that you might have, such as a poll or an aggregator, or news, or a pundit’s opinion, all of that is being combined in the participant’s markets who have an incentive to get it right and to make money off of it.”\nBut if prediction markets are as accurate as some experts say, why would there be such a discrepancy with what polls are showing? It comes down to what each is measuring, Ryan Waite, vice president of public affairs at public affairs consultancy Think Big, told Fortune.\n“Polls tell us how voters feel right now, while prediction markets attempt to predict what will happen in the future,” he said. “Prediction markets are quicker to respond to new information, such as economic shifts or debate performances, while polls take time to update.”\nBut prediction markets aren’t perfect, Waite said, explaining that they can be manipulated by someone with a lot of money who wants to sway perception and that they aren’t always accessible to everyone.\nStill, polls have issues of their own, including sampling bias, leading questioning, and nonresponses that can also produce inaccuracies. That’s why—at least for now—using both polls and prediction markets can help us understand future political events.\n“While prediction markets are gaining traction, they’re not going to replace traditional polling anytime soon,” Waite said. “They provide a complementary perspective. Polls help us understand how different voter segments feel about candidates or issues, while prediction markets can provide a dynamic view of how the broader public thinks things will play out. Together, they give a fuller picture of the political landscape.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its massive rally early on Tuesday, rising as much as 11% in premarket trading as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election.\nShares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, jumped on Monday to close over 18% higher.\nOver the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris.\nSeparately, DJT announced the web launch of its Truth+ TV streaming service on Monday. The app is currently available to access on Android devices and will soon be released as a native Apple iOS app.\nDJT shares traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period last month. The stock has also been under pressure, as previous polling saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president.\nTrump's recent campaign momentum follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July.\nTech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of next month's election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve \"with all the things he's got going on.\"\nAt the rally, Musk told the crowd that Trump is the only candidate who can \"preserve democracy in America,\" adding this will be \"the last election\" if Trump does not win.\nMeanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration.\nTrump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus.\nBut as Truth Social attempts to take on the social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question.\nIn August, DJT reported second quarter results that revealed a net loss of $16.4 million, about half of which was tied to expenses related to the company's SPAC deal. The company also reported revenue of just under $837,000 for the quarter ending June 30, a 30% year-over-year drop.\nEarlier this month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September.\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $27 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $5.5 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $3.3 billion. Right after the company's public debut, Trump's stake was worth just over $4.5 billion.\nTrump Media went public on the Nasdaq in late March after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. But the stock has been on a bumpy ride since, with shares oscillating between highs and lows as the moves have typically been tied to a volatile news cycle.\nOver the past six months, the stock has been off around 15% — a massive improvement on the heels of the rally after shares hit their lowest point last month.\nStakeholders, including the former president, were subject to a six-month lockup period before being able to sell or transfer shares. That lockup period expired on Sept. 19, although Trump said at the time that he would not sell his stake.\n“I have absolutely no intention of selling,” the former president told reporters at a press conference prior to the lockup period expiration. “I love it. I use it as a method of getting out my word.”\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

An appeals court upheld the order in October.\nRobinhood introduced futures and index options trading features to its mobile app earlier this month.\nThe company, which became synonymous with mom-and-pop investors in 2021, is now aiming to evolve into a comprehensive financial services provider and compete with established brokerages catering to institutional clients.\nIt committed earlier this year to expanding margins and prioritizing \"profitable growth\" in 2024.

        "article_content": "A hotter-than-expected jobs report released Friday sets up a contrast for the final month of the 2024 campaign as Democrats and Republicans prepare their closing economic arguments.\nShould voters care about the fact that there are over 16 million more jobs in the US economy now than when President Joe Biden took office — or is the fact that prices rose by nearly 20% over that same stretch a more important measure?\nWhich side wins that argument could be a key advantage when voting ends on Nov. 5 in the neck-and-neck contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.\nFor today at least, the economic data was a tailwind for Democrats, with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that the labor market had added 254,000 jobs in September, blowing away the 150,000 that economists had expected.\nIt comes during a final phase of the election year where both campaigns are at full tilt but with an open question as to whether voter views, at least when it comes to the economy, are set.\n\"There's a belief from history that people form their opinions about the economy kind of earlier in the year,\" Kyle Kondik, the managing director of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said this week during an episode of Yahoo Finance's Capitol Gains podcast.\nBut he added one major difference this time around. \"With the swap out of Harris at the top of the ticket, it seems like Democrats are maybe in a little bit better position on the economy, although Trump generally still has advantages on that issue.\"\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nAs for Democrats, the response Friday morning echoed a familiar refrain of touting good jobs numbers (Friday's numbers put the total tally for Biden over the 16 million milestone for the first time) but also quickly acknowledging the pain voters are feeling due to inflation.\n\"Today, we received good news for American workers and families,\" Biden began his statement Friday before quickly noting inflation as well.\n\"Make no mistake: We have more to do to lower costs and expand opportunity,\" he added.\nIt was a message repeated among a range of top Democratic figures.\n\"This is strong stable steady job growth, it's the very definition of a solid recovery,\" added acting Labor Secretary Julie Su in a live Yahoo Finance interview Friday morning. \nBut, like her colleagues, she quickly acknowledged lingering economic unease by adding that \"we need to keep that up until everybody feels it.\"\nIt's a reflection of a trend pollsters have seen for nearly all of 2024 that suggests voters are more focused on prices than jobs.\n\"The golden rule is stay away from anything macro that is about other people's lives,\" said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, in an interview earlier this year.\nGreen has presented his group’s polling results to the White House and the Harris campaign, adding that the Democratic message can't only \"be that somebody 3000 miles away is getting a job.\"\nRepublicans' reaction to Friday's report indicated their focus is expected to stay squarely on inflation, specifically that prices are up nearly 20% during the Biden/Harris administration.\n\"Under Kamala, prices have already soared,\" the narrator intoned in a new Trump campaign ad released yesterday.\nSome Trump allies also responded to the news Friday by making baseless claims the report was doctored.\nMake America Great Again Inc. — a super-PAC supporting Trump — called it a \"fake jobs report,\" charging that \"Americans don't trust these reports because they feel the pain of this economy every single day.\"\nPolling has tended to show Trump with a lead — but a small one — on economic issues overall as Kamala Harris has made up ground on the topic.\nTrump has shown a lead on the economy in most polls, but some polls have shown the race within the margin of error or even with a narrow Harris lead.\nThe Financial Times has recently had two polls showing Harris as more trusted on the economy. A Morning Consult poll of the economy had the two candidates tied at 46%.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have war chests overflowing with nearly a billion dollars (at least) as they enter the final phase of the 2024 campaign. Now the sprint begins to spend it all.\nThe campaigns have been unveiling plans in recent weeks for a massive blitz of ads aimed at nearly any screen swing state voters may come across over the coming two or so months.\nThe latest data available through the beginning of August showed Harris, Trump, and their directly allied groups with bank accounts totaling a combined amount of around $700 million, according to the campaign finance trackers at OpenSecrets, including more than $370 million raised directly by the two campaign operations.\nOutside super-PACs backing one of the candidates also reported another $200 million or so in the bank.\nAnd even these eye-popping totals are surely now significantly higher after an August that featured another wave of fundraising efforts, the Democratic National Convention, and a nonstop series of political headlines.\nPerhaps only one thing is abundantly clear as the candidates enter the fall campaign neck and neck: neither campaign is going to be short of funds for the forthcoming sprint.\nWhether the television and phone screens of swing state residents can handle the onslaught perhaps remains to be seen.\nFrom now until Election Day, the clear priority for all of this money is ad after ad after ad — a contrast to the earlier part of the contest when a decent chunk of campaign cash went to hiring staffers and opening field offices.\nThe Harris-Walz campaign has been the most specific about their plans for the fall, recently announcing plans to reserve $370 million in advertising that will begin after Labor Day and run through November.\nThe money is divided between $170 million for traditional TV spots and $200 million for digital ads.\nThe campaign is calling that latter figure the largest digital reservation in the history of American politics and announced this week that much of their initial ads using that money will be focused on the controversial \"Project 2025\" plans that have been put forth by close Trump allies (but disavowed by Trump himself).\nAhead of a debate between Harris and Trump on Sept. 10, \"our campaign won't waste a minute communicating to the voters who will decide this election every single day,\" Harris-Walz principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks promised in a statement.\nThe main super-PAC supporting Harris has also announced plans to spend $250 million on its own slate of ads between the Democratic convention and Election Day.\nFormer President Trump's campaign has so far been less clear about its intentions. But AdImpact, a media tracking service, has reported on millions of dollars in TV spots already in the works.\nAll told, approximately $438 million dollars of TV reservations have already been made between the two sides, according to the group.\nViewers around the country will face an onslaught of ads. Pennsylvania, as expected, will bear the brunt, with over $140 million in television advertising set to be aired in the coming months.\nAnd much more is surely in the offing. Trump himself has also signaled that significant campaign resources will be devoted to organizing and training watchers to appear at polling sites on Election Day.\nThis is an effort he said will \"protect the vote,\" but his critics charge it could also be an effort to intimidate Democratic-leaning voters.\nTrump has also outsourced to allied super-PAC groups much of his campaign's ground-game efforts for getting his voters to the polls. Many have noted it's a risky strategy that will leave him with less direct control of this central campaign function.\nMeanwhile, the effort to raise even more money has barely slowed despite all of the cash already in hand.\nThe Harris-Walz campaign recently announced that in the month since President Joe Biden ended his campaign on July 21, the Harris-Walz effort has raised an astonishing $540 million, but it remains to be seen how much of that fell in the July or August reporting period.\nAnd the candidates — especially the two vice presidential nominees — are still sneaking in plenty of fundraising stops.\nThis Labor Day period itself includes a slew of reported fundraising stops from Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Anna Wintour raising money for Harris in the Hamptons, a wealthy enclave near New York City, to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp raising money for Trump in Atlanta.\nThe Harris campaign has also found a novel new fundraising source in for form of massive Zoom calls for different interest groups.\nThe effort began with hundreds of thousands joining meetings (and donating millions) around groups like Win with Black Women and White Dudes for Harris.\nRecent days featured targeted events like a YIMBYs for Harris livestream looking to capitalize on a recent Harris focus on housing; it raised nearly $100,000 for the campaign.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-11-21T22:19:04.000Z",
        "article_content": "Voters spoke in the 2024 elections, and what they said was bring prices down and get immigration under control.\nSome beneficiaries of the 2024 election heard a different message. “On November 5, voters decisively elected Donald Trump with a mandate for sweeping change,” Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who are running Trump’s government-efficiency commission, wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Nov. 21. “They deserve to get it.”\nSome voters here and there might want sweeping change, but that’s not what a majority of the electorate is looking for. Trump beat incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris in the popular vote by a mere 1.6 percentage points, and his margin in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin was less than that. There was no “coattail” effect in the House of Representatives, which Trump’s Republicans will control with the same narrow margin they have now.\nIn post-election polls, 41% of voters said inflation was their top voting concern, followed by 35% citing immigration, according to a Harvard CAPS/Harris survey. After that came the economy in general, women’s rights, healthcare, crime, and climate change. The only hint of dissatisfaction with the government was 13% who said the national debt was their top concern. That landed eighth.\nYet Musk and Ramaswamy are set to remake the government in much the same way that Musk tore into Twitter after he bought it in 2022, slashing payroll, charging new user fees, and rebranding it as X. Musk and Ramaswamy will run a new “Dept. of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE, that will be outside the government but work with the Trump White House to streamline the federal bureaucracy and zap redundancies.\nIn their Wall Street Journal op-ed, the two business gurus said they’d target three types of reform to cut $500 billion in annual spending: killing excessive regulation, reducing administrative bloat, and saving taxpayers money. In other remarks, they’ve sounded more draconian. On Nov. 1, Musk, the CEO of Tesla, said spending cuts likely to come from his commission’s work would involve “temporary hardship” for many Americans. Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur, has called for an across-the-board cut of 75% of federal government workers.\nFor the DOGE Bros, these are the heady days of half-baked plans and exaggerated ambitions that haven’t yet collided with reality. So the hyperbole may be harmless.\nBut voters didn’t ask for anything of the sort that Musk and Ramaswamy seem to have in mind. The two bureaucracy bashers are projecting their own desires onto voters and claiming that Trump’s modest win gives them a blank check to do something voters haven’t asked for.\nThere are three possible outcomes to this assault on Uncle Sam. One is that the efficiency commission proposes deep cuts and painful reforms that never end up happening, as many other commissions have done. Congress holds almost all of the authority for spending and would have to get with the program, which it usually doesn’t.\nIn a recent analysis, investing firm Evercore estimated that DOGE might be able to identify “hundreds of billions” of dollars in possible spending cuts over a decade, far less than the $500-billion-per-year target. Even then, Congress is likely to increase spending on defense and border control while cutting government revenue through lower taxes. All told, that’s the formula for yet another commission that doesn’t make a dent.\nAnother possibility is that the Trump administration tries to slash the government without Congress’s approval, which would surely provoke a superstorm of litigation. Some Trump aides say a 1974 law on “impounding” federal funds could let Trump strangle targeted agencies by simply refusing to spend money Congress appropriated to fund them. The result would probably be chaotic until the Supreme Court settled the question of whether Trump actually has such authority. But that could be a de facto diminution of government, at least until then.\nThird, Congress could broadly go along with the DOGE commission and grant most of the spending cuts and agency executions it calls for. This seems very unlikely, since members of both political parties exercise power by overseeing the very spending Musk wants to cut. But who knows, Musk might cast a spell that temporarily blocks the self-preservation function on Capitol Hill and allows the unthinkable.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nThe bigger question is, how would any of this benefit voters?\nOne way would be if Musk identifies massive spending cuts, Congress enacts them, and Americans get a refund check from the federal government for all the money it is no longer spending. That’s not in Musk’s Twitter template, however, and the amount of savings required to materially lower taxes — without pushing the gigantic national debt even higher — is mathematically fantastical.\nWhat is in the Twitter template is a cutback in services that alienates users and a degradation of value that costs investors. Applied to the government, this would mean Trump and his Boys Wonder fire thousands of people who answer questions at the Social Security office, process passports, administer farm aid, manage national parks, oversee highway repair, enforce workplace safety, staff air traffic control towers, and take care of veterans. The federal government surely is bloated, like many big organizations. But it also provides valuable services to millions of Americans who may not even realize that their customer service agent is a villainous bureaucrat.\nAbout 3 million people work for the government. If you fired one-third of them, the unemployment rate would jump from 4.1% to 4.7%. Musk says the plan is to resettle these federal exiles in the private sector, but that wouldn’t happen immediately and for some people it wouldn’t happen at all. That would be a million families applying for unemployment insurance and tightening up their spending in the face of sudden career uncertainty.\nCoffee shops, dry cleaners, barbershops, and many other small businesses in the vicinity of affected agencies would lose customers, and some would shut down. Many federal agencies are spread around the country, way beyond Washington, D.C., including some in underdeveloped areas that don’t have other big employers. Maybe they could apply for the farm work likely to be available when Trump deports millions of undocumented migrants. This is the “temporary hardship” Musk is talking about.\nDo voters want this? Ramaswamy thinks so. “Do we want incremental reform, or do we want revolution?” he asked during his own brief presidential bid, the point being revolution, of course. Then he got Trump’s ear. It remains to be seen if Trump heard the voters who simply want a break on the rent and a cheaper fill-up at the gas station.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended gains on Wednesday, rising over 4% as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election in less than two weeks.\nThe moves come after the stock hit its highest level since July on Tuesday, with shares closing up nearly 10%.\nOther Trump-related stocks moved in tandem with DJT, with mobile-advertising software company Phunware (PHUN), which has ties to the former president, jumping roughly 20% on Wednesday after rising above 40% the previous session.\nConservative-leaning video platform Rumble (RUM) saw earlier swings to the upside, climbing as much as 8% earlier on Wednesday. But the stock gave up those gains by the afternoon, with shares closing down over 4%.\nShares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, have seen a recent surge as both domestic and overseas betting markets shift in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris.\nNational polls, however, show both candidates in an incredibly tight race, especially in key battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, which are likely to decide the fate of the election.\nThe recovery in shares comes after the stock traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period last month. Shares had also been under pressure, as previous polling around early September saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president.\nTrump's recent campaign momentum, which just included a stop at a local Pennsylvania McDonald's, follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July.\nTech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of next month's election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve \"with all the things he's got going on.\"\nAt the rally, Musk told the crowd that Trump is the only candidate who can \"preserve democracy in America,\" adding this will be \"the last election\" if Trump does not win.\nMeanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration.\nTrump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus.\nBut as Truth Social attempts to take on the social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question.\nIn August, DJT reported second quarter results that revealed a net loss of $16.4 million, about half of which was tied to expenses related to the company's SPAC deal. The company also reported revenue of just under $837,000 for the quarter ending June 30, a 30% year-over-year drop.\nEarlier this month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September.\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of above $35 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $7.1 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $4.3 billion. Right after the company's public debut, Trump's stake was worth just over $4.5 billion.\nTrump Media went public on the Nasdaq in late March after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. But the stock has been on a bumpy ride since, with shares oscillating between highs and lows as the moves have typically been tied to a volatile news cycle.\nOver the past six months, the stock has been off around 8% — a massive improvement on the heels of the rally after shares hit their lowest point last month.\nStakeholders, including the former president, were subject to a six-month lockup period before being able to sell or transfer shares. That lockup period expired on Sept. 19, although Trump said at the time that he would not sell his stake.\n“I have absolutely no intention of selling,” the former president told reporters at a press conference prior to the lockup period expiration. “I love it. I use it as a method of getting out my word.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Betting on election outcomes is now legal in the U.S., and as easy as wagering for a sports team to win. But experts warn against mistaking betting markets for polls.\nA handful of companies, including Kalshi and Interactive Brokers, have been allowing users to tap their way to wagering on Donald Trump or Kamala Harris to win the election. Just days before the election, even stock-trading platform Robinhood jumped in on the party, offering a betting market of its own. The companies set their own betting limits, with Kalshi letting users wager as much as $100 million.\n“We believe event contracts give people a tool to engage in real-time decision-making, unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold,” Robinhood said in a statement Monday.\nElection bets were approved legally just weeks ago, as the 2024 race headed into its home sprint. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates financial contracts that bet on events, has consistently blocked applications to open up bets on elections under Republican and Democratic administrations alike.\nBut that changed last month when a U.S. district court sided with Kalshi in a lawsuit the company filed against the CFTC, arguing that it should be allowed to offer the contracts. The ruling cleared the way for Kalshi to open betting markets on the election while the CFTC appeals. The ongoing legal wrangling could still lead to a shutdown of U.S. election betting markets, but not until after the 2024 vote.\nIn the meantime, “it pulls us, the CFTC, into the responsibilities of being an election cop,” Chairman Rostin Behnam said last week, maintaining that the agency would respect the court decision while election bettors place their wagers. Millions of dollars have since flooded the markets. Kalshi said bets on the general election hit $30 million within its first three weeks, surging to $139 million by Friday.\nOverseas, where bets on American elections are nothing new, billions of dollars have been circulating.\nCrypto-based betting platform Polymarket is hosting over $2 billion in bets, likely from foreign traders. It’s technically banned to users in the U.S., where the CFTC slapped the company with a $1.4 million fine in January 2022 for taking election bets as an unregistered platform, issuing a cease and desist that effectively barred it from the domestic market. But with private, encrypted internet networks readily available, industry watchers say Americans may still be able to access foreign platforms.\nPredictIt, a project from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, offers contracts of its own. The platform is available to Americans, but with a betting limit of $850. Founder John Aristotle Phillips says having “skin in the game” forces users to remove the “spin and emotion” from their expectations of election outcomes.\nBut Phillips says the public should interpret prediction markets carefully when it comes to politics.\n“A market will give you the odds of an event happening,” he said. “It has nothing to do, and can’t give you insight, in terms of what the margin of victory or loss is going to be, which is what a poll is intended to show.”\nIn many of these markets, bets are quoted per wagered dollar. So if a general election wager shows 52 cents for one candidate winning, then 52 cents successfully wagered on that candidate would return $1 — a payout of 48 cents.\nBut if pricing shows one candidate at 52 cents over the other candidate at 48 cents, that does not mean the former is projected to win 52% of the popular or electoral vote.\nPolls ask prospective voters whom they will vote for, so if 52% of voters tell a pollster that they support one candidate and 48% say they support the other, then a margin of 4 percentage points can be concluded among that sample group.\nNBC News doesn’t cite betting odds as proxies for political polling. Odds and gambling platforms don’t use methodologies used by traditional political polling, and therefore are not substitutes for political polls.\nNonetheless, public discussion around betting market odds has blurred the lines, with prominent voices at times confusing the two.\nIn early October, multibillionaire Trump donor Elon Musk cited Polymarket odds and posted on X that the former president was “leading” Harris by 3%.\nBut Polymarket showed only that bettors viewed the odds of Trump winning as 3 percentage points higher than the opposite outcome, not that Trump was ahead of Harris by 3 points among actual voters. Musk asserted that the Polymarket odds were “more accurate than polls,” even though users of the platform are likely entirely foreigners who can’t vote in U.S. elections.\nPolymarket also attracted scrutiny after large bets by four accounts were placed in late October. As The Wall Street Journal first reported, the bets appeared to surge the betting odds for a Trump win. Polymarket later said all those wagers were made by a single French national. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nThe CFTC permits only U.S. residents to use the newly opened election betting markets, meaning many bettors on the platforms are also potential voters.\nKalshi lets bettors wager as much as $100 million on the outcome of the general election, but the company says any effort to thumb the scale by placing huge bets should be washed out by the market.\n“If the truth is actually 50-50, and the market is priced at 60-40, there’s a huge incentive, like multi-tens of millions of dollars, to bring the prices back. And this is what happens in these markets,” Kalshi founder Tarek Mansour said.\nHe added that unlike Polymarket, Kalshi is required to comply with laws like Know Your Customer, under which users must submit personal data to help head off potential financial crimes. “We know if they’re bad actors and we enforce rules,” Mansour said.\nNonetheless, Adam Cochran, founder of venture capital fund Cinneamhain Ventures, says he worries about how voters perceive election betting odds. Prediction markets should be merely a “data point in how we evaluate elections,” he said, “just one slice” of where the momentum may be going in a campaign.\n“Politics in America and, growingly, around the world, has become more like supporting your favorite sports team,” Cochran said.\nMansour acknowledged it’s a “fair concern” that the general public might mistakenly see betting odds as the size of a candidate’s lead.\n“This is different than a poll. There’s been a little bit of misconception,” he said.\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

        "article_content": "Americans voted in the 2024 elections for a return to the past. But the past may not welcome the visit.\nDonald Trump’s sweeping victory in the 2024 presidential election was a roaring endorsement of his “Make America Great Again” theme, which promises the restoration of grandeur from some storied point in the nation’s history. Trump never pinpoints the exact time when America was last great, but he doesn’t have to. Voters fill in the blanks by recalling the best times in their own personal pasts and imagining themselves there.\nWhat Trump doesn’t do is account for everything that has changed since America’s glory days, whether they were in the 1950s or the 1980s or early 2000s. Service and information jobs, rather than blue-collar ones, now dominate the economy. The fossil fuels Trump so dearly loves have caused global warming that is beginning to raise the cost of insurance and home ownership across the nation. The world is becoming more dangerous in ways no American president can control. Consumers have gotten used to cheap goods, even if they come from problematic countries.\nTrump’s promises to raise tariffs on imports, deport millions of immigrants, shun clean energy in favor of more oil and gas, and put billionaires in charge of government aren’t going to make America better. Trump, of course, will claim the opposite, despite any evidence to the contrary. But the old standards Trump wants to restore are gone forever.\nTrump wants to rebuild US manufacturing, for instance, even though US manufacturing doesn’t need rebuilding. US industrial output is 63% greater than in 1990 and close to record highs. But manufacturing has declined as a portion of the overall economy as services have become a greater part. The manufacturing sector in 1947 accounted for 26% of GDP. Today it’s around 10%. Manufacturing employment has fallen as well, from a peak of 19.6 million workers in 1979 to about 12.9 million today.\nThis is the way economies evolve. Old industries slide down the value-added chain while new industries replace them at the top. The services sector has grown from 47.8% of GDP in 1947 to 72% today and includes some 137 million jobs in healthcare; hospitality; finance; real estate; transportation; professional services like insurance, law, and accounting; and many other types of businesses. Many jobs involve technology and the cutting-edge skills of developers, systems analysts, and people adept at deploying artificial intelligence. The growing part of the economy is where jobs tend to pay the most and workers with the right skills get furthest ahead.\nTrump is focused on a declining part of the US economy that constitutes just 10% of GDP while ignoring most of the other 90%. To get what he wants — more manufacturing jobs — Trump will have to persuade investors to start or expand businesses employing manual laborers when the real money is in more efficient, highly automated factories that help business owners offset the generally higher costs of operating in the United States. Nobody wants to own or invest in a business that’s less efficient and more labor-intensive than it needs to be. It’s hard to see how Trump will coax anybody to invest in a 50-year-old business model.\nBy the same logic, Trump could go on a crusade to Make Farms Great Again by reinstating the hordes of field workers who have now been replaced by machines. The share of workers employed in agriculture has dropped from 90% in 1790 to less than 2% today. Yet farm output goes up and up because of productivity gains. It would sound absurd to hear a politician today say we need more farming jobs, simply because we used to have more. Yet that’s basically Trump’s argument on manufacturing.\nThe appeal of Trump’s MAGA pitch has a lot to do with education. Factory jobs once offered workers a decent living even if they had little education, and Trump wants people to think they can once again get ahead with a high school degree or less. But this assumes businesses will be willing to hire less-qualified workers and endure the lower productivity that comes with that. Not likely.\nTariffs, of course, are Trump’s main tool for boosting US manufacturing. By raising the cost of imports, tariffs are supposed to raise the return for building stuff in America, even if costs are higher and productivity is lower. Trump draws inspiration from William McKinley, an ultra-protectionist politician who became the 25th US president in 1896. McKinley later softened on tariffs, however, and became an advocate of greater trade, but maybe Trump never got to that part of the Wikipedia entry.\nThe tariff heyday of the 1890s was also the peak of the robber baron era, when rapid industrialization allowed a certain class of entrepreneurs to build generational fortunes with little burden from regulators or the tax man. That, too, could be a model for the second Trump administration.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nTrump vows to put billionaires such as Elon Musk in charge of reforming the federal bureaucracy and other government policies while keeping taxes low for the wealthy and maybe cutting business taxes even further than he did in 2017. If America was great back in the 1890s, however, many Americans didn’t get the memo. The unemployment rate hit 19% amid a deep recession, and the excesses of the Gilded Age ultimately led to the adoption of the dreaded income tax.\nAmerica had another moment of greatness in the 1950s, when the Eisenhower administration launched “Operation Wetback” — no kidding — to deport millions of immigrants out of concern they were taking jobs that would be better filled by Americans, including soldiers leaving the service. But that effort was largely viewed as a policy and PR flop that didn’t nab that many immigrants and left those who did get rounded up in horrific transport conditions some likened to slave ships.\nTrump has cited this operation as a model for what he might do in a second term, but there’s a catch this time around — it’s not clear who would step into the jobs of suddenly deported migrants doing essential work. Farms and dairy operators could end up woefully short of workers, either pushing prices up or causing shortages. It's not as easy getting rid of workers — even undocumented ones — when there's no reserve labor force.\nVoters elected Trump to a second term for a number of reasons, including simply acknowledging the plight of some Americans who are falling behind and don't see a way out. Going back won't solve their problems, however. The winners are the ones who can adapt to the future, and that's not something Trump is offering.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Could there be a Kamala Harris landslide in November? The data scientist who correctly called the last election is betting yes",
        "date": "2024-09-24T16:10:39.000Z",
        "article_content": "In late 2020 and early 2021, this reporter wrote several stories focusing on the election predictions advanced by Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University. I was intrigued by the highly original methodology Miller deployed in calling the trends, and outcomes, first in the presidential race, then for the two Georgia senatorial contests, where the surprise twin victories gave Democrats control of the upper chamber.\nNow, Miller is back in the arena for the first time since offering those highly unconventional forecasts. He's using a similar system to handicap the supposedly super-tight presidential election that will be decided just 48 days hence. His wildly out-of-the-mainstream call is sure to shock pollsters, pundits and Fortune's readers alike. But Miller's view merits close attention for two basic reasons: First, it's based on numbers-crunching that's arguably a lot more scientific than the voter surveys almost always cited to chart the contest's trajectory, and second, he achieved pinpoint accuracy four years ago.\nIn all three 2020 contests, Miller beat virtually every pollster, and modeler parsing multiple voter surveys. He missed the size of Biden's win in the electoral college by just 12 votes, tagging every state for the correct column save Georgia. For the two senate runoffs, Miller refined his approach to sorting data on the Peach State, and scored again. A week before Election Day on December 6, 2020, the polls gave Republican David Perdue a wide lead over Democrat Jon Ossoff, and showed the GOP's Kelly Loeffler in a dead heat versus opponent Raphael Warnock. By contrast, Miller's numbers had Loeffler heading for a big loss, and Ossoff en route to a modest victory. Once again, the contrarian academic nailed it: Miller was just 0.2% short on Warnock's 2.0% margin, and precisely on target in forecasting Ossoff's 1.0% final bulge at the ballot box.\nMiller's approach vastly differs from the most of political prognostications by relying not on polls, but the prices established by Americans wagering their own dollars on the candidates they reckon are most likely to prevail. \"Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,\" he told Fortune. He states that while polls tell you about the past, the odds on the betting sites map the future. \"Polls are a snapshot of the recent past,\" he adds. \"They typically canvas small samples of 500 to 1,500 people. And the pollsters are asking respondents whom they're planning to vote for at that moment, which may have changed a few days later when the results are posted. Most polls are around four or five days behind.\"\nThat lag, he says, causes a lot of noise or variability that disguises the actual picture. Another problem with polls: Miller reckons that a better question than \"Tell us which candidate you'll vote for?\" is \"Which candidate do you expect to win?\" And while the pollsters don't pose that query, it's just how the bettors are making a market.\nFor the 2020 Biden-Trump face-off, Miller deployed the pricing posted on the largest U.S. political betting site, PredictIt. He took the PredictIt odds in the 56 individual voting jurisdictions, tracked the hourly changes, and used his proprietary model to roll the data into daily odds that were extremely current given that folks were posting bets for one candidate or the other 24-7 on the site. For the Senate races, Miller took a different tack. He assembled a group of about 1,200 Georgians whom he lured by agreeing to pay them a few dollars to participate, and extra dollars if they named the contender most likely to win—not the necessarily one they planned to vote for, as well as predict the margin for victory. The method he developed, called a \"prediction survey\" taking the best parts of the polling and the betting market guided Miller to a near-perfect reading of the voting shares.\nFor the 2024 presidential race, Miller is once again relying on PredictIt. He praises the site for \"having a more stable group of investors\" than the populations screened by pollsters. \"You have tens of thousands of people betting on the site at all times of the day,\" he says. \"The maximum contract is $850, and 37,000 'shares' are traded on average every day.\" Put simply, Miller regards PredictIt as a highly liquid market resembling an exchange for, say small-cap stocks or high yield bonds that gathers huge numbers of buyers and sellers. \"Financial markets are forward-looking, and incorporate information instantaneously, and PredictIt provides the same benefits,\" says Miller.\nFor gauging Biden-Trump rematch, Miller developed a \"generalized, linear model\" based on results from the most recent sixteen presidential elections starting in 1960. Starting with that year's Kennedy-Nixon race, every presidential race has been decided by 538 electoral votes. \"The model's based on a lot of historical data,\" says Miller. It shows that the daily pricing on PredicitIt translates closely into the share of the popular vote favoring each candidate. Say on a certain day, bettors give candidate A a quote of 52 cents, amounting to 52% chance of winning. By Miller's reckoning, those 52% odds should also mean that at that moment, the best forecast holds that 52% of likely voters plan to cast their ballots for candidate A.\nEach day, Miller recorded the prices posted at midnight on a graph where he overlayed the crucial events shaping the election. Titled, \"Effects of Current and Campaign Events on Forecasted Electoral College Votes,\" it's posted on his website, The Virtual Tout (virtualtout.com). Overall, the chart tracks the number of electoral votes the PredictIt odds are showing. It's shaped like a giant \"U,\" resembling a steep ski slope that bottoms then rises into a giant mountain.\nWell before the Biden-Trump debate, the Republican was far ahead; on Miller's chart, he stood on top of the ski slope. Trump looked to command almost 400 of the 538 electoral votes in mid-June. After the onstage match on June 27, Trump got even more dominant, and he peaked in the days framing and during the Republican convention at a share of almost 500. The Democrats' odds rose sharply after Biden withdrew on July 21, and by the time Harris secured the nomination on August 6, the Democrats were solidly in the lead at around 325 electoral votes. They kept gaining over the following two weeks, hitting 400 in a stunning reversal by the time their convention ended on August 22.\nThen, Trump staged a comeback. In the days before the September 10 Trump-Harris debate, Harris was still ahead, but Trump had nearly caught up. \"At that point, the race was essentially a tossup,\" observes Miller. \"The forecast for the Democrats was 288.\" It was the onstage battle in Philadelphia that wrecked the 78-year old former POTUS, according to the Miller numbers. Within a day after the candidates left the podium, Harris had jumped to exactly over 400 electoral votes. The Harris endorsement from Taylor Swift, secured the day of the debate, probably helped sink Trump's chances, according to Miller. Since then, Harris has maintained for 400-plus vote total.\nA second chart on The Virtual Tout shows how the share of the popular vote influences the electoral tally over those 16 elections. Keep in mind that Miller is using the PredictIt prices as equivalent to the popular vote: A candidate whose price is 51% on Election Day is likely gets 51% of all ballots cast. He points out that Democrats traditionally must secure an advantage of more than two points or more to win, and that Republicans can prevail with as little was roughly 48%.\nAs of September 16, PredictIt is showing a price of 55 cents for Harris, and 45 cents for Trump, the reverse of the scenario before Biden's departure. Once again, those odds translate in 55% of the popular vote for the Democrat according to Miller's model. If the situation persists, Trump faces an absolute rout. \"It would be somewhere between the defeats of Barry Goldwater by Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and Bob Dole by Bill Clinton in 1996,\" says Miller. \"We're talking about a blowout where Harris gets over 400 electoral votes and wins Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and every other swing state.\"\nMiller notes that at least in recent history, America's never witnessed a reversal of fortune remotely as dramatic as this one. \"It's gone from a drastic landslide in Trump's direction to a drastic landslide for Harris,\" he marvels. The distance is now so great that only another epic swing would bring Trump back into contention, and Miller predicts that right now, it looks like Harris will win big on November 5. As a coda, he recalls a slogan the Johnson campaign used to bash Goldwater: \"In Your Guts You Know He's Nuts.\" Miller's markets-based analysis posits that the people betting their own money are right in predicting that by the time the candidates left the stage on September 10, millions of voters likely to back Donald Trump abandoned the ex-President, starting the shock waves that could cause an avalanche for Harris that as of now, few see building.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "If the 2024 presidential election ever gets around to serious issues, you’re likely to hear a lot of happy talk from Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The Democratic and Republican presidential nominees have a lot of plans for tax cuts and government giveaways, customized to please each candidate’s desired constituencies.\nBoth candidates, however, are whistling past America’s biggest economic challenge: A gargantuan national debt that is going to hamstring the flexibility of future presidents like never before. In the worst outcome, a debt crisis could trigger a nasty recession and years of punishing fiscal austerity that will drive voters to new levels of vexation.\nThe national debt recently hit a new record high of $35 trillion, and it’s only going to keep growing. Debt scolds have been warning about unsustainable levels of US debt for 30 years, and many predictions of a debt crisis haven’t come to pass.\nBut the United States is now in unprecedented territory for any government, ever, and financial markets have begun flinching at all the debt the US Treasury is issuing. Some analysts think the debt crisis has already begun.\nIn a recent episode of the Yahoo Finance Capitol Gains podcast above — see the 13:30 mark — debt expert Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute summarized what the nation needs to do to get the debt under control and forestall a crisis. Riedl recently wrote a 43-page report on the problem, which Yahoo Finance explained in a July 9 story.\nThe good news is that the United States doesn’t need to pay off the entire national debt — far from it. If we can stabilize the debt at current levels, which means sharply reducing annual deficits, it would put the nation on much sounder footing and probably be sustainable indefinitely, barring dramatic unforeseen developments such as a large war.\nWhile the total national debt is $35 trillion, about $7 trillion of that is special securities held by the government in accounts such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The amount that matters to markets is federal debt held by the public, which is all securities sold to investors by the Treasury Dept. That totals about $28 trillion, which is roughly the size of the US economy. So, federal debt held by the public equals about 100% of GDP.\nThe goal is to keep debt levels no higher than 100% of GDP. Alas, that’s not going to happen unless there’s dramatic change. Social Security and Medicare are both paying out more than they’re taking in, and that will only get worse as more Americans enter those programs. Net interest payments are rising sharply because interest rates have risen and the total amount of debt the government is financing has risen too. Other portions of the federal budget are simply underfunded.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nThe Congressional Budget Office sees publicly held federal debt rising from 100% of GDP now to 122% within 10 years and only going up from there. The CBO doesn’t forecast recessions, so that doesn’t include any chance of a downturn during the next decade that would require fiscal stimulus, which always adds to deficits and makes the federal debt even bigger.\nIn Riedl’s analysis, closing the federal revenue-spending gap will require about $10 trillion of savings during the next decade. That could come in the form of budget cuts or new taxes, or a combination of both. But the scale of such an effort needs to be massive. Trimming a few programs or instituting new taxes on their own won’t come close to solving the problem.\nWhat would solve the problem are changes to Social Security and Medicare cutting benefits for wealthier enrollees and raising the eligibility age. Medicare would have to be restructured to become more efficient. All that could be done while safeguarding benefits for lower-income seniors, who rely most on these safety net programs. Any such changes would doubtless be unpopular, yet far better than what would happen if the programs ran short of money and the only options were to cut benefits across the board.\nNeither presidential candidate, needless to say, is campaigning on the vote-losing promise of cutting retiree benefits for some in order to sustain some benefits for all. More than that, each candidate is proposing tax cuts and deficit-funded policies that will make the whole problem worse, not better.\nThe biggest budget battle looming during the next two years is what to do about the 2017 Trump tax cuts for individuals, which expire at the end of 2025. Trump and his fellow Republicans want to keep all the 2017 tax cuts in place, while perhaps cutting the business tax a bit from its current 21% level. Trump also wants to eliminate taxes on income derived from tips and get rid of income taxes on Social Security benefits. All told, that would add about $6 trillion to the national debt.\nHarris, like President Joe Biden when he was the Democrats’ 2024 presidential candidate, wants to let the 2017 tax cuts expire for those earning more than $400,000 but keep them in place for everybody else. Democrats also want to eliminate the cap on state and local tax deductions, which was part of the 2017 tax law, while also boosting tax credits for working parents and lower-income households. Her plan would add about $5 trillion to the national debt.\nBoth candidates, in other words, are going the wrong direction, if stabilizing the debt is the priority. “The reality is, 10 trillion is hard enough,” Riedl told Yahoo Finance on the Capitol Gains podcast. “Harris and Trump are probably going to push it up to 15 or 16 trillion right away.”\nBoth candidates, meanwhile, say they’ll protect Social Security and Medicare, with no changes to benefits. That “makes it mathematically impossible to stabilize the debt,” Rield says.\nIn Washington, D.C., everybody knows what it will take to finally do something to get the debt under control: a crisis that makes it apparent to everybody that something needs to be done and there’s no other choice. That’s the least competent and most expensive way to deal with the problem — but voters themselves probably wouldn’t have it any other way.\nNo politician can get elected by vowing to reform retiree programs — remember when President George W. Bush tried to reform Social Security back in the day? That's especially true now that mass disinformation allows cranks and scaremongers to transmogrify any reasonable-sounding plan into Armageddon.\nMany voters say they’re worried about the imposing size of the national debt, but most people want somebody else to pay to fix it. The inevitable result is that we’ll all end up paying, and it will be a lot more than necessary.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "The impact of a 10% to 20% tariff on America's trading partners floated last week by Donald Trump has raised trade issues anew on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\"It's basically you hurt us, and we hurt you,\" Trump said on Monday in Pennsylvania while discussing his desire to put up reciprocal tariffs on trading partners.\n\"It's an eye for an eye, and it's common sense,\" added Trump, who was weighed into the topic repeatedly in recent days.\nDemocrats are also seizing on the idea, with Kamala Harris charging that it would represent a \"national sales tax.\" And President Joe Biden, among others, brought it up Monday night as Democrats gathered in Chicago for their convention.\n\"Donald Trump wants a new tax on imported goods: food, gas, clothing, and more,\" the president said during his keynote speech.\nTrump's idea for blanket tariffs is one of a series of proposals in recent days from both sides that economists don't love, including Harris’s plan to impose the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and a new homeowner subsidy of $25,000.\nBut trade experts are deeply skeptical of a notion Trump has pushed in recent days that a tariff \"doesn't affect our country.\"\n\"At the end of the day, it's the US importer that will absorb [the tariff] and the US consumer ultimately that will pay the price,\" Ashley Craig, a Washington, D.C.-based trade lawyer, said this week, echoing the concerns of many.\n\"I think he's deliberately refusing to recognize that,\" Craig, the chair of Venable's International Trade Group, added about Trump.\nThe back-and-forth is the latest chapter in a debate over trade that has raged for years, ever since Trump instituted a historic wave of duties on China and other trading partners.\nHis move while in office upended decades of free-trade doctrine in Washington and proved to be durable. Biden has not only kept the duties in place but raised them in certain \"strategic\" sectors.\nIn pitching a return to office, Trump had already proposed a massive expansion of those trade wars, including a 10% tariff on imports from around the world and 60% duties on goods from China.\nThen came last week and the speech in Asheville, N.C.\n\"We are going to have 10% to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years,\" he told the crowd, repeating the point for emphasis.\nTrump then followed up with an extended discussion of tariffs during a rally Saturday in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., where he said, among other things, that \"a tariff is a tax on a foreign country: That's the way it is, whether you like it or not.\"\nHe added that \"it's a tax that doesn't affect our country.\"\nMany economists and trade experts strongly beg to differ, noting that tariffs are actually assessed on companies as they bring goods into the United States.\nThere is a debate about exactly how those costs are distributed, but it's clear that consumers bear a large burden in the form of increased prices.\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics has run the numbers and found that Trump's initial tariff ideas (60% duties on China and 10% on other trading partners) would lead to a typical middle-class household paying at least $1,700 more each year.\nAnother estimate from Brendan Duke of the left-leaning Center for American Progress comes in even higher. He finds that a 10% tariff combined with 60% on Chinese goods could mean an additional cost of $2,500 for a typical family in the middle of the income distribution.\nAnd a 20% tariff could mean an additional cost of $3,900.\nEven Trump himself seemed to back away slightly on Monday during an appearance in Pennsylvania, where he didn't repeat the possibility of 20% tariffs and downplayed the effects of 10% duties.\n\"A small 10% tariff on foreign-made products will allow massive tax cuts for working families,\" he said, citing a study from a group called Coalition for a Prosperous America that found tariffs would raise consumer prices by about half a percent per year but that those increases could be offset by tax cuts.\nTrump and his allies also often point out in response to critics that inflation remained under control during the four years of his presidency — even as that first round of tariffs went into place.\nThe criticisms of Trump's plan have indeed flowed in from a range of current and former Democratic officials.\n\"It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs,\" Harris said last week in North Carolina, likening tariffs to \"a national sales tax.\"\nWillett Advisors LLC chairman and CEO Steven Rattner — a former Obama administration official — said in a recent interview on Yahoo Finance that Trump's tariff agenda would be a \"hugely regressive form of tax\" that could spur new inflation.\nHarris, meanwhile, hasn't outlined her tariff agenda yet, but some experts expect she could be a reset of sorts on the issue as she has been focused elsewhere during her time as vice president.\nHarris did vote no in 2020 on the Trump-negotiated USMCA trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. She cited the need for more worker and environmental protections as her reason for opposition.\nShe appears likely to continue much of Biden's approach for now, according to Venable's Craig.\n\"I don't see her, frankly, walking away from the Trump tariffs that Biden has not walked away from, maybe a little bit of relief here and there like Mr. Biden did,\" he said.\nCraig added: \"I wouldn't see a radical transformation if there was a Harris White House.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-07-29T21:07:44.000Z",
        "article_content": "As a Democratic senator from California in 2019, Kamala Harris launched a presidential campaign that fizzled before voting even began. She dropped out of the 2020 race two months before the Iowa caucuses.\nHarris’s 2024 campaign for president is profoundly different. As vice president, she’s on track to inherit the nomination from President Joe Biden, who withdrew from the race on July 21. She’ll avoid anything resembling a primary election and a battle with other candidates. That gives Harris a chance to position herself as far more moderate — and perhaps more electable — than she seemed in 2020.\nBack then, Harris took liberal stances on many issues, making her barely indistinguishable from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two other presidential candidates who outlasted her until Biden clinched the Democratic nomination. Here are four of the biggest issues Harris supported then that she has backed away from now:\nHarris backed this Bernie Sanders plan, which would have ended private health insurance and enrolled every American in a government program similar to Medicare. Biden did not support Medicare for All in 2020, calling instead for expanding the Affordable Care Act to cover more people. Biden did, in fact, sign legislation doing that, though the ACA expansion expires at the end of 2025. Harris has backed away from Medicare for All and now seems to support new legislation to make the ACA expansion permanent, as Biden does.\nLast time around, Harris supported the “Green New Deal.” This would have banned the fossil fuel drilling technique known as fracking, which has generated a massive boom in US oil and natural gas production during the last decade. Biden did not support the Green New Deal, instead calling for some cutbacks in fossil fuel development along with large subsidies for green energy.\nBiden did, however, sign a huge green energy bill into law, and, at the same time, oil and gas production has hit new records under Biden. Soaring gasoline prices, which hit $5 in 2022 and correlated with a plunging approval rating for Biden, underscored the political necessity of keeping energy plentiful and affordable. The Harris campaign, not surprisingly, now says she no longer wants to ban fracking.\nOther elements of the Green New Deal were so ambitious about ridding the economy of fossil fuels that they would have necessitated a de facto government takeover of the transportation and energy sectors. Biden has pushed toward similar environmental goals, but has mostly used incentives such as tax credits instead of forcing disruptive change by law or regulation. That’s a big difference. Bringing change through market incentives is likely to be much smoother than having the government dictate outcomes.\nHarris and several other liberal Democratic senators voted against Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve in 2018, saying he was too friendly toward the banking industry. He got the job anyway and ended up helping steer the US economy through the 2020 COVID downturn. Biden reappointed Powell to a second term, which runs through 2026. If Harris became president, there’s no reason to think she’d move to fire Powell. But her stance in 2018 revealed an anti-corporate bent that could unnerve investors if it resurfaces when it's time to appoint the next Fed chair in 2026.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nPoliticians do change their views and rebrand themselves from time to time. So Harris may be able to convince voters she has evolved toward Biden’s more centrist views while serving as his second in command.\n“I wouldn't put any credibility on prior positions of candidates,” Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, told Yahoo Finance in a July 29 interview. “Kamala Harris has a strong pro-growth agenda. She’s close to a lot of folks in Silicon Valley, really supports the innovation economy. So I'd really focus on what she does going forward.” Polis also points out that Republican nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have changed their positions on a wide variety of issues.\nYet the battle is on over who best defines Kamala Harris: Her own campaign, which would do so benignly, or the Trump campaign, which seeks to discredit her.\n“The key question for maintaining enthusiasm will be who defines Harris over the next 30 days,” political analyst Bruce Mehlman wrote on July 28. A worst-case outcome for Harris, he points out, would be something akin to the “Swift-boating” of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004, when some veterans who served with Kerry during the Vietnam War accused him of dishonesty about his record, helping sink his presidential bid.\nOn the plus side for Harris, she’s been relatively aligned with Biden on repealing the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy, the broad goal of addressing climate change, and social issues such as abortion. She’s also commanding vast amounts of attention, providing a better chance to set the terms of conversation leading up to Election Day on Nov. 5. With the right strategy, the new and improved Kamala Harris could erase memories of the old model.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Dogecoin, the popular meme coin boosted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, saw its price spike by more than 13% on Wednesday after Donald Trump claimed victory in the 2024 presidential race.\nOther popular altcoins like Shiba Inu also saw a 4% spike, while bitcoin’s price jumped to more than $75,000. Prior to the election, the world’s largest cryptocurrency had been struggling to top its March high of approximately $73,000. Renewed optimism around cryptocurrency's post-election price trajectory, spurred by Trump’s victory at the ballot box, finally pushed it over the edge.\nMemecoins have been enjoying popular resurgence in the period before Tuesday’s highly-anticipated election, performing even better than the digital asset market at large and reflecting greater risk-taking by investors.\nTrump's successful White House run is expected to change crypto policy, sparking greater optimism about the price of digital assets. “With Donald Trump securing the presidency, significant changes are expected across various sectors, particularly for bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market,” said James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares. “Trump’s administration is likely to pursue policies that foster a more favorable environment for bitcoin, potentially benefiting its value, adoption, and long-term viability.”\nAs for Dogecoin booster Musk, the tech tycoon is likely to take on an influential role in the incoming Trump administration. Rumors abound that Musk might be appointed to a Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a jocular allusion to the memecoin. This appointment could potentially increase Dogecoin's visibility and support, though the full implications of this move remain to be seen."

        "article_content": "Puzzle this out: When Joe Biden was still the 2024 presidential candidate, voters were fed up with inflation and Biden polled poorly. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held enough of a lead over Biden in mid-July that financial markets started to price in a full Republican sweep of the White House and Congress come November.\nLess than a month later, Biden has dropped out, replaced at the top of the Democratic ticket by Vice President Kamala Harris. Inflation is basically the same as it was a few weeks ago: gradually improving but still too high. Yet Harris has rocketed ahead of Trump in the polls, and betting markets now give Harris better odds of winning than Trump.\nAre voters giving Harris a pass on inflation? Or is it something else?\nInflation isn’t the only factor in the election, of course. But it has been Biden’s biggest economic liability, with the high prices of the last few years eroding purchasing power and bumming out voters. When an incumbent president runs for reelection, it’s almost always a referendum on his handling of the economy.\nOne explanation for Harris outperforming Biden could be that voters blame Biden much more than Harris for inflation. That would suggest limits to the incumbency theory of blame for economic woes: Voters might blame the main incumbent — the president — but lesser incumbents, not so much.\nIt’s also possible that voters’ poor opinions of Biden are more personal and less a reflection of the economy than many analysts have guessed. It’s never 100% clear why voters like or dislike a president. Voters soured on Biden as inflation worsened in 2022 and 2023, so it seemed one caused the other. But maybe voters who sent Biden to the White House in 2020 have simply fallen out of like with him as he’s aged and slowed down, and their views aren't that connected to the economy.\nThis is more than just a political parlor game. At the moment, Harris seems to be enjoying a best-case outcome for Democrats: A fresh presidential candidate not encumbered by the worst parts of Biden’s record. It might last. In the latest Yahoo Finance Capitol Gains podcast, Tobin Marcus, head of policy for Wolfe Research, points out that in 2022, when inflation was close to its peak, Democrats outperformed in the midterm elections, losing far fewer seats than is normal for the president's party.\n\"In 2022, when inflation really was running out of control, voters said in exit polls that was the No. 1 problem,\" Marcus says. \"But it didn't sink Democrats. When you looked at voters who said, 'The economy's not so good,' they still voted for Democrats in numbers similar to the overall electorate.\"\nIf Harris can shake Biden's inflation curse, it could represent a crucial Democratic reset with voters. Biden enjoyed a 55% approval rating during his first month in office. The first big dent in that came with the botched withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan in August 2021, which left 13 American service members dead in a suicide bombing. Biden’s approval fell further in 2022, when inflation hit 9% and gasoline prices crested $5 per gallon for the first time ever. Biden’s approval never recovered.\nHarris’s approval rating was around Biden’s depressed level one month ago. But her approval is now rising. In polling by The Hill, her approval rating has jumped 10 points since the end of June, to 47%. Americans who didn’t know much about Harris seem to like what they’ve seen during the last few weeks as she has suddenly become the center of attention in the political world.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nFor the last two years, Republicans have tried to link inflation directly to Biden, calling it “Bidenflation.” But the same charge might not stick to Harris. Nobody called inflation \"Harrisflation,\" and by now, it might be too late. Trump seems more focused on trying to brand Harris as a California liberal and questioning her racial identity.\nIf Harris does outrun the inflationist label, the economy could break her way during the last couple of months before the election. Inflation concerns that have dominated markets for the last two years are now yielding to worries that the economy may be softening too much. But that’s exactly what the Federal Reserve has been trying to do, through a series of abrupt rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. It actually looks like it’s working.\nThe early-August stock market sell-off has partially reversed, and traders are adapting to a new environment in which they expect the Fed to be cutting rates as hiring and spending slows. Unless there’s a surge of layoffs, which economists don’t expect, consumers seem bound to benefit from lower borrowing costs and stable prices through the end of the year, with some things getting cheaper.\nHarris’s rise won’t continue unabated. Her honeymoon period will end, she’ll have to start answering tough questions about where she stands on key issues, and she’ll probably make a few mistakes. But if she’s free of the inflation leash that kept Biden corralled, she’ll have a much better chance than her current boss of winning in 2024 based on what she does between now and Election Day.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

For proof, look at 2024 presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Both already have much more wealth than the average American.\nLearn More: I’m an Economist — Here’s My Prediction for Social Security If Kamala Harris Wins the Election\nFind Out: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nIn Trump’s case, he was born into wealth and then expanded it mainly through real estate holdings and other investments. Harris has used her presidential campaign to tout her middle-class upbringing, but today her net worth qualifies her as a millionaire many times over.\nNeither candidate has much in common financially with the typical American. The average net worth for all Americans is $1.06 million, according to the latest Federal Reserve data. But that figure skews much higher due to the impact of the very wealthy. The median net worth — a much more accurate figure — is only $192,900.\nIn terms of how much money Americans make, the median weekly earnings of the nation’s 119.9 million full-time wage and salary workers were $1,143 during the 2024 second quarter, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That translates to $59,436 a year. In contrast, the president’s annual salary is $400,000, as set by Congress in 2001.\nThe Washington Post recently did an analysis of the finances of Trump, Harris and vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz, based on various government and tax filings and wealth estimates from Forbes.\nHere’s a look at the financial status of both Trump (as of Sept. 16, 2024) and Harris (as of July 2024).\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nNet worth: $3.9 billion\nBusiness income: $635 million\nSale of Trump International Hotel: $284 million\nMoney owed from court judgments: $50 million\nBook royalties: $4.7 million\nTrump gets a federal pension as a former president, but his businesses provide the lion’s share of his income. The ex-president reported at least $635 million in income from real estate, hotels, resorts and golf properties in 2023, according to The Post. Much of his net worth is now tied to Truth Social’s parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group.\nIn addition to income from those sources, Trump has reported earning $300,000 in royalties from “The Greenwood Bible,” as well as about $4.4 million from his 2023 book, “Letters to Trump.”\nAs for liabilities: The latest Trump filings list more than $50 million in liabilities owed to both writer E. Jean Carroll and the New York attorney general due to separate legal rulings that went against the ex-president. The actual payments might end up costing more than $500 million, according to The Post, though Trump has filed appeals contesting the judgments.\nCheck Out: I’m an Economist — Here’s My Prediction for Social Security if Trump Wins the 2024 Election\nNew worth: $8 million\nMortgage balance: $1 million to $5 million\nVice president salary: $284,600\nBook royalties: $450,000\nHarris and husband Douglas Emhoff reported a combined income of nearly $400,000 on their 2023 tax return, The Post noted. Most of that was from her income as vice president. Harris and Emhoff also reported just more than $50,000 in taxable interest from Wells Fargo bank accounts on their return. In addition, they hold more than $2 million in different investment and retirement funds, including in several ETFs.\nHarris held a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds as of March 2023. Those included Vanguard, iShares and BlackRock funds. In 2021, the total value of investments owned by Harris and Emhoff was estimated at $2.25 million to $5.29 million. Additionally, she and her husband had $1.5 million to $3 million in cash. Real estate holdings include properties in California and Washington, D.C.\nHarris reportedly earned more than $450,000 in royalties during her first year as vice president for her 2019 memoir, “The Truths We Hold,” and a children’s book, “Superheroes Are Everywhere.”\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "With this year’s rising popularity of presidential election prediction markets, not only can pollsters predict the outcome of the election, but ordinary investors can too. Robinhood, the latest platform to make its foray into election betting, has raked in over 100 million bets after introducing contracts last week, according to the company’s CEO.\n“100 million contracts have been traded in less than a week on @robinhoodapp’s Presidential Election Market,” Robinhood CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev posted on X on Sunday.\nOn the Robinhood app, users can watch in real-time as bets are placed and the likelihood of either candidate’s victory adjusts accordingly. At the moment, former President Donald Trump leads with 55% while Vice President Kamala Harris is polling at 46%.\nRobinhood's betting site appears like this:\nRobinhood, which lets users trade a wide variety of stocks and crypto assets, introduced U.S. election betting on its mobile app last week. The presidential election contracts are the first event contracts to be offered on its prediction market. In order to place bets, users have to meet certain criteria including being a U.S. citizen and having been approved for a Robinhood Derivatives account.\nRobinhood’s rollout came after a court in September sided with prediction market Kalshi, which had sued the CFTC to challenge a long standing prohibition on election betting. The ruling opened the door to these contracts in the U.S., leading Kalshi to launch bets on the Presidential race soon after. The new offering attracted $30 million in bets in its first three weeks.\nThe CTFC is appealing the decision which could halt betting, but not until after the 2024 election.\nKalshi and Robinhood are not the only prediction markets that offer election betting. Polymarket, a platform that offers contracts in cryptocurrency, and PredictIt have popular contracts too.\nWhile Polymarket cannot operate in the United States, its U.S. election prediction market has amassed almost $3 billion worth of volume and had Trump polling around 58% on Monday. However, recent evidence suggests a large portion of trading on the platform is fake.\nPrediction markets work like this: If Trump has a 55% chance of winning on Robinhood, contracts in favor of Trump will go for $0.55 and users can purchase multiple contracts to increase their winnings – or losses. If Trump wins then you receive $1 for each contract and if he loses you receive $0 for each contract.\nIt is important to note the timeline when purchasing election contracts on Robinhood. While the election is scheduled for November 5th, the outcome of the contracts will not be determined until January 7th and users will not receive a payout until January 8th.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-11-01T10:00:51.000Z",
        "article_content": "I couldn’t take it anymore.\nI’ve been writing about the Trump trade, talking with people making Trump trades, and parsing the Trump trade for any hints that the 2024 presidential election is leaning one way or the other.\nFinally, I made a Trump trade of my own: A financial investment meant to capitalize on the outcome of the presidential election. I bought, with my own money, an option contract on shares of Donald Trump’s new company, Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT). I will either make money or lose money based on the outcome of the presidential election — then let all of you know which way it went, so you can cheer me on or roast me.\nI’m not a sophisticated trader. I could have simply bought shares in Trump’s company if I thought Trump was going to win or shorted those shares if I thought Trump was going to lose. But the hot trades are in options on DJT shares, which are timed bets allowing the trader to either buy or sell shares in the future at a certain price by a certain deadline. I wanted to be where the action is and learn more about what’s going on deeper in the markets than I usually go.\nI've never traded options before, so I asked Eric Hale, founder and CEO of Trader Oasis, to guide me through the process. Hale didn’t tell me what to buy. He asked me what I wanted out of the trade. He emphasized that his guidance didn’t constitute financial advice and that option betting has a binary outcome: I would either make a one-time profit or lose my investment completely.\nFrankly, he told me, this isn’t a shrewd way to spend your money.\nI said thanks for the advice, now can we figure out the trade? I take the polls at face value. Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are basically tied. I have no inside info — and I have no clue who’s going to win. So I didn’t feel strongly one way or the other about whether I should bet on a Trump win or a Harris win.\nI do think, however, that betting markets overstate Trump’s odds and that traders are placing too much emphasis on betting odds they believe to be bullish for Trump. That could be a false signal.\nJim Bianco of Bianco Research recently joined the YF Capitol Gains podcast to explain how betting markets work. At the time, betting markets gave Trump 60% odds of winning and Harris 40%. If that were a poll, Trump would have a huge lead. But Bianco explained that betting markets are probabilities, not poll margins, and anything less than 66% for Trump is the equivalent of a toss-up.\nInvestors in DJT have not been acting like the race is a toss-up. DJT, whose main product is the Truth Social app, is a pipsqueak social media company with little revenue that probably has no chance if Trump loses. Trump himself is the sole attraction on Truth Social — and if he loses in 2024, his political career will mostly be over and Truth Social will lose the only real reason for people to join. But if Trump wins, Truth Social could be a necessary destination for everybody eager to know what’s happening as Trumpworld takes over the executive branch.\nIf there were a \"Harris trade,\" I'd be looking into investing in that too. But Kamala Harris mostly represents the status quo in terms of trade, financial markets, and other things investors care about. Trump, with his plans to jack up import tariffs, deport millions of migrants, and further slash taxes, would bring the sorts of changes that disrupt markets and reprice assets.\nThe DJT share price is probably the best single indicator of whether investors think Trump is likely to win. In mid-September, they didn't, and DJT sank to around $12 per share, the lowest level since the company went public in March and closed at $58 on its first day of trading. Traders were basically guessing that Trump would lose and betting that his company would drift into oblivion. Since then, however, the stock has skyrocketed to as high as $52 on Oct. 29. On Oct. 30, the day I placed my wager, DJT closed at $40.\nMy guess is that DJT is overvalued and is likely to fall in price, possibly by a lot. So I bought a put contract with a strike price of $25 that expires on Nov. 15, 2024. An options contract typically involves 100 shares. The price of my put was $3.90 per share, or about $390 in total, for the right to sell 100 shares.\nWhat this means is that if the price of DJT stays above $25 through the time my contract expires on the close of trading on Nov. 15, I’ll be out my $390 and the trade is over. If the price goes below $25, before the contract expires, I’ll be “in the money,” as investors say.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nHale helped me estimate my possible gain at different prices. I’ll break even at the point the contract expires, on Nov. 15, if the share price falls to $21.10, at which point I will have fully recouped my $390 investment. At $15, I’ll make a net profit of at least $610. My net gain would be at least $1,110 if the price drops to $10 and at least $2,110 if the price drops to $0. My return could be greater if the price of DJT falls sooner.\nMy track record on trendy bets is lousy. In 2021, I tried my hand at meme stock trading by buying 171 shares of BlackBerry at $14.60 per share, for about $2,500 in total. If BlackBerry had taken off the way GameStop did, I could have netted $200,000. But BlackBerry had no meme left in it and I ended up losing $1,760.\nAround 2017, I bought some shares of Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage underwriter that had been in conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis. The play was that the Trump administration would privatize Fannie Mae and turn it into a real company, sending the stock higher. But the stock I bought at around $3.75 per share only went down. It now trades at around $1.40. I sold, sheepishly, a few years ago.\nMy bet on DJT falling below $25 could pay off if Trump wins the election and the stock price tanks anyway. That seems unlikely, however, which means I’m basically staking my bet on Kamala Harris winning and Trump losing. So Trump fans can freely troll me if Trump wins and I end up $390 poorer. If I win, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.\nEither way, watch Yahoo Finance for one final, climactic dispatch on how my Trump trade turns out.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "The future of Social Security remains a looming question for millions of Americans who count on those benefits in retirement. If President Joe Biden wins a second term, his administration will face mounting pressure to make changes for the future of the Social Security program. Substantial reforms may be necessary to ensure the program remains available for generations to come.\nRead Next: Retirement Savings: 4 Expenses Retirees Regret Keeping in Their Budgets, According to Experts\nFor You: 9 Easy Ways To Build Wealth That Will Last Through Retirement\nCurrent projections suggest that Social Security will run dry by 2034, which means that hard choices may be needed to shore up the program’s finances. The decisions made during a potential Biden second term could dramatically reshape Social Security for both current and future retirees.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nAaron Cirksena, founder and CEO of MDRN Capital, suggested that one potential change that Biden could implement would be “a potential way to means test Social Security benefits for higher net worth people.”\nThis would mean reduced monthly checks for higher net-worth retirees, while preserving more generous benefits for lower and middle-income seniors. It would mark a big change from Social Security’s current policy of providing the same benefits (in terms of percentages) to all retirees, regardless of their wealth.\nBe Aware: Retirement Spending: 9 Things Even Spendthrifts Don’t Waste Money On\nOf course, Biden may have to take even bolder action to address Social Security’s looming problem of dwindling funds.\nThe Social Security Administration’s latest projections indicate that the program’s funds will be depleted by 2034, at which point incoming payroll taxes will only be sufficient to cover approximately 77% of scheduled benefits. There simply won’t be enough to go around.\n“It should be clear, however, that Social Security will not run out in 2034,” said Cirksena. “It simply won’t have enough new money coming in to meet the obligations. There will always be new money flowing into Social Security.”\nThe first approach Cirksena said Biden might try to implement would be raising the age at which full retirement benefits are available from Social Security.\n“Raising retirement age for younger workers is the obvious solution,” said Cirksena.\nWhile politically contentious, this could help the program’s resources last longer, as well as account for increasing life expectancies.\nThe Biden administration may also look to tighten the eligibility criteria for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), said Cirksena.\nSSDI provides benefits to individuals who have worked and paid Social Security taxes but can no longer work due to a long-term disability. If the criteria for who qualifies becomes stricter, less people would be able to claim benefits, which would mean the funds in the program would last longer.\nHowever, care would need to be taken so that the process does not become too difficult for legitimately disabled individuals to receive the support they need.\nOne of the more dramatic potential revenue-raising options Biden could pursue, according to Cirksena, is removing the income cap for Social Security payroll taxes entirely, creating a new tax for higher income earners.\n“It wouldn’t be a surprise if the Biden Administration looks at a more permanent solution that combines a social security tax on higher income earners well above the current limitations with delaying retirement for more workers,” said Cirksena.\nAs of 2024, earnings above $168,600 are exempt from Social Security’s 6.2% payroll tax. If all wages were taxed at the same rate, it could provide a major influx of funds to Social Security.\nThis would mean a significant tax increase for higher-income workers, which is unlikely to be popular. But with a looming shortage of available revenue, removing the cap is one way to make Social Security’s funding last for everyone beyond 2034. This may not fix all of Social Security’s issues, but it could be one piece of a reform package which Biden could implement.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n6 Fall Essentials To Buy at Aldi To Save Money\n6 Strategies Anyone Can Use to Pay Off Debt\nI'm a Debt Expert: Here's How Social Media Warps Our Perceptions of Debt\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for Social Security If Biden Wins the 2024 Election"

        "date": "2024-04-09T20:30:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be just as exciting and contentious the 2020 contest. That’s because it looks to be a rematch between President Biden and former President Trump. There’s a wildcard thrown in this time with Robert Kennedy Jr. running an independent campaign that could pull voters from both sides.\nThe stock market went on a rollercoaster ride four years ago. A decade-long bull market was brought up short by the pandemic. The S&P 500 lost one-third of its value in a matter of weeks only to make a U-turn and soar higher once more. It wasn’t uncommon to see stocks soar by 1,000% or more.\nThese are the seven top 2020 stocks that didn’t end up crashing and becoming penny stocks. Can they repeat their prized performance from four years ago? Let’s find out!\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: pixinoo / Shutterstock.com\nThe pandemic, of course, was the defining moment of 2020. Not only for the devastation it caused in our lives but also for the opportunity it created for companies to rise to the challenge. Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) shocked everyone when the Operation Warp Speed committee granted it $1.6 billion in federal funds to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. It was more than any other drugmaker was given at the time. Its vaccine candidate had the best potential in testing ahead of even Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). It hadn’t undergone human testing at the time but preliminary results in primates looked promising.\nAs we all know, both Pfizer (and its partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Moderna went to market first. They were given emergency use authorization (EUA) for their experimental vaccines and shielded from liability for any damages for harm caused by them. Today, myocarditis — a potentially deadly inflammation of the heart muscle — is more common in people who received Covid vaccines than those who are unvaccinated.\nNovavax, though, would be late in releasing its own vaccine. NVAX stock soared 2,695% in 2020, and tripled again in early 2021, ultimately plummeting back to earth. From it’s all-time high of $320 per share, Novavax trades at around $4.40 per share today. While it has a combination Covid and flu vaccine in development, there seems little chance it will repeat as a top performer this year.\nSource: Shutterstock\nBack then, HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ:HIVE) was known as HIVE Blockchain Technologies. It changed its name last year to better reflect its new focus on high-performance computing data centers. It was another stock that generated enormous returns in 2020 only to go on and soar even higher the following year.\nAt the time, though, it was all about bitcoin mining as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was blowing through the $20,000 price threshold. Mining stocks were seen as an attractive way for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin’s price in a relatively risk-free way because they were seen as cryptocurrency infrastructure stocks.\nBitcoin mining isn’t anywhere near as popular today. It’s why HIVE Digital is no longer HIVE Blockchain. Particularly as the Bitcoin halving event will make mining even less profitable than it is now because it will slow the production of new Bitcoin.\nHIVE Digital soared 2,507% in 2020 and doubled again in February, hitting almost $21 a share. It has since lost 88% of its value and trades at around $3.30 per share. No amount of rebranding will turn around its fortunes this year.\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\nMake it three in a row with Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK), which began to ramp higher in 2020 only to reach its apex in 2021. Afterward, it would begin a long slog lower.\nThe electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment provider as the EV industry was hot and the need for charging stations was strong. Blink Charging ended 2020 with over 16,600 charging stations installed, of which 7,062 were on the Blink Network. That was a 12% increase over the year before.\nRevenue had tripled to $6.2 million while gross profits rose four-fold to $1.5 million giving it 24% gross margins. Blink was still a loss-generating business, and net losses had almost doubled to $17.8 million, but it was seen as well on the path to a bright future. The stock rocketed 2,186% higher that year.\nToday the EV industry is in a different place. While still expanding, demand is rapidly shrinking globally and EV makers are resorting to price-cutting to lure buyers in. It’s not a healthy situation and one that has cooled the momentum for charging station stocks. Blink Charging sunk from over $60 a stub to below $3 a share.\nSource: Photo courtesy of Vaxart, Inc.\nOkay, make it four companies. Biotech Vaxart (NASDAQ:VXRT) has seen several massive spikes in its stock. It started 2020 as a tiny penny stock but the pandemic help it burst onto the scene. Jumping onto the vaccine bandwagon, Vaxart announced it was pursuing an oral vaccine for Covid and the stock made its way from 34 cents per share all the way up to $17 a share. And just as quickly plummeted back down to around $1 per share. It closed out the year under $6 a share making for a nice 1,600% gain.\nIt would be a repeat performance in 2021 when it rocketed to over $23 a share after announcing positive phase 1 results from its investigational VXA-CoV2-1 vaccine. At this point though, Vaxart was well behind the pack in developing a Covid vaccine. Both Pfizer and Moderna had released their vaccines two months prior. Vaxart’s therapy is still in Phase II testing.\nWith that said, as Vaxart notes, “it is now the only company to have taken an oral tablet COVID-19 to a Phase II clinical trial.” Pfizer and Moderna essentially conducted an experiment on the entire global population. They only operated under the EUA and have never gotten traditional FDA approval for their shots. If Vaxart’s ever makes it through to the end it may be the first to achieve a positive result through rigorous testing.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nIt wasn’t just HIVE Blockchain undergoing a reimagining after the Bitcoin mining mania wore off. Riot Blockchain also changed its name last year, becoming Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT). It’s purpose was to reflect its growth strategy and the diversified nature of its operations, though Riot’s goal is still to be “the world’s leading Bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform.”\nShrinking profit margins were turning investors off to mining operations, so rebranding as “digital” or becoming a “platform” took the sting away from the association. Applied Blockchain also transformed into Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD) for much the same reasons. Many others did so as well.\nWhile it was still a mining operation though, Riot rode the intense investor enthusiasm to a 1,390% gain in 2020. It would reach its all-time high just two weeks later, cresting at $29 before losing two-thirds of its value. Today Riot Platforms stock trades at $10 a stub as no amount of rebranding can turn the business around.\nSource: Oleg Ivanov IL / Shutterstock.com\nBiotech Cardiff Oncology (NASDAQ:CRDF) didn’t rise to glory in 2020 on the back of the Covid pandemic. Rather, as its name implies, it had bigger fish to fry in cancer. Its lead molecule, onvansertib, was a unique opportunity because it was targeting cancer caused by the KRAS mutation. That is an error in a normal cell protein that signals the body to produce more cells, which turns into cancer.\nAlthough there are other drug developers focused on the KRAS mutation, including Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), this was Cardiff’s only drug and if successful, it would have been a multi-billion opportunity. Shares soared 1,328% in 2020 on that potential.\nCRDF stock ran higher again in 2021 as well after some promising, though mixed results in early phase testing caused the stock to stumble. It would go on to fall further in 2022 as additional results also showed promise but underwhelmed the market. But it’s off to the races again in 2024!\nCardiff Oncology stock is up 300% so far this year and is nearly 400% higher over the past six months. Virtually all of the gains came in just the last months after the drug developer reported positive results from testing. As of this writing CRDF stock is in the top 20 of stock performance this year meaning there’s a good chance it can repeat its winning results of 2020.\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\nUnfortunately, Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) isn’t likely to do so. It will more likely mimic the performance of Blink Charging than Cardiff. As noted before, the EV industry is in a state of flux. With sales growth ebbing, this back-of-the-pack EV stock isn’t going to suddenly charge to the forefront.\nNio is also not profitable, so the ongoing price-cutting environment will only set Nio’s chances back even further. But in 2020 it didn’t look that way at all.\nWhere most other EV companies were building sedans, Nio was making SUVs and finding a market for them. Even amid the pandemic, which China responded to far more harshly than Western governments did, Nio was steadily growing monthly sales and had secured financing from Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and the government. Nio stock soared 1,089% in 2020.\nAfter hitting an all-time high of $63 a share in early 2021, Nio long ago skidded off the road. The stock goes for less than $4.50 a share today and nothing suggests it’s about to rev its engines higher.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That includes China, a key market for both Qualcomm and Intel.\nIntel shares fell 3.3% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\nQualcomm made a preliminary approach to Intel on a possible takeover of its struggling rival in September. In the same month, the company made informal inquiries with antitrust regulators in China to gauge their stance on any potential deal, some of the people said. Qualcomm hasn’t received any feedback from Chinese authorities, which are waiting to see if the company actually makes a formal bid, they said.\nIntel is at the heart of the US government’s plan for a homegrown chipmaking renaissance, making the political backing for any deal crucial. The Biden administration has consistently framed the importance of its chipmaking policy in national security terms. Intel is in line to get the biggest allocation of funding under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, if it goes ahead with all of its factory building plans. Qualcomm has been speaking with US regulators and believes an all-American combination could allay any concerns, people familiar with the matter have previously said.\nMaking a bid after the election may bring other advantages for Qualcomm. Intel will report third-quarter earnings later this month. If that follows the pattern of the disappointing announcement of three months ago and the impact it had on the potential target’s stock price, it could make a deal considerably less expensive for Qualcomm. This time around, analysts are predicting another net loss in excess of $1 billion for Intel.\nQualcomm’s deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty that the company will decide to pursue an offer for Intel and the timing could change, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment, while the State Administration for Market Regulation in China didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nUnder Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel has been working on an expensive plan to remake itself and bring in new products, technology and outside customers. As part of a recently announced shakeup, Intel intends to turn its programmable chip division into a standalone business and sell shares to the public or seek an investor for it.\nApollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel, Bloomberg News reported last month, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and a possible alternative to any takeover by Qualcomm.\n--With assistance from Liana Baker, Ian King and Zheng Wu.\n(Updates with premarket shares)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating—With Big Consequences\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs\nA Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work\nDeveloping Countries Can’t Count on Manufacturing to Supercharge Growth\nNeuralink Co-Founder’s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

        "date": "2024-11-18T20:04:14.000Z",
        "article_content": "I bet against Donald Trump, and lost. I got ahead, anyway.\nIn the final days of the 2024 US election, the “Trump trade” was getting woolly. Investors who thought Trump would win or lose the presidential race were betting for or against the impact his economic policies might have. New tariffs on imports might be bad for shippers and good for domestic producers. Tax cuts could generate larger deficits and higher interest rates. Deregulation could yield more corporate mergers.\nThe most direct Trump trade was a bet on the shares of Trump’s own company, Trump Media & Technology Group, known by its ticker symbol DJT. A Trump win could boost the fortunes of the flagging Truth Social network, while a Trump loss could doom the money-losing venture. The stock price was yo-yoing based on every hint that Trump was up or down in the polls.\nI decided to sample the action. I wanted to place an options trade on DJT, because that’s the way many other Trump traders were playing it. I’m a plain vanilla investor, so I asked Eric Hale, founder and CEO of Trader Oasis, to guide me through an options trade. I didn’t know if Trump would win or lose, but I thought shares of DJT, which had been trading around $50, were seriously overpriced. The company was a social media pipsqueak with barely any revenue, yet the stock price gave it a market value of $8 billion. That seemed way too high under any election outcome.\nI bought a put contract with a strike price of $25, which meant I could sell 100 shares at a profit if the price fell below $25 before my contract expired on Nov. 15. The contract cost $3.90 per share for 100 shares, so $390 in total. I’d make a profit of about $1,110 if the price dropped to $10, and $2,500 if it went to 0. If the price never fell below $25 by Nov. 15, I’d be out the full $390.\nFor a few days, it looked promising. The stock closed at $40 the day I bought my put. It fell to nearly $30 the following day, which pushed the market value of the put higher than what I paid for it. I could have closed the trade then for a small profit. But I wanted to go the distance.\nTrump won, of course, which should have demolished my Trump trade. But instead of soaring after Trump’s win — which was the expectation trading action had been signaling — the stock languished. There was a brief uptick once the election outcome was clear, but then the stock fell to $30, then $27. A couple of bucks lower and I’d get back at least get some of my money.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nOn Nov. 15, the day my put expired, the stock crawled back to about $28. I was out of luck and my $390 was gone. It was my second failure to capitalize on an investing fad. In 2021, I tried my hand at meme stock investing by buying shares of BlackBerry. I went underwater right away and ended up losing $1,760.\nOther Trump traders hit the jackpot. The “French whale” who wagered $70 million on a Trump win on the betting site Polymarket took home an $85 million profit. Big bank shareholders saw handsome gains on the likelihood of softer regulation. Anybody who owned the beaten-down shares of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac enjoyed a 70% pop on hopes that Trump will privatize the two federal housing agencies.\nI should swear off trendy investing ideas, except I got it right once. I bought a bit of cryptocurrency during the heady days of 2017, when bitcoin was starting to garner mainstream attention. A year or two later, I bought stock in a crypto-related company. Trump’s win in 2024 turned out to be bullish for crypto, since he’s promised friendly policies. I didn’t plan it this way, but my crypto gains offset the $390 loss, and then some, and then some more.\nMy Trump trade also gave me a rudimentary understanding of how to place option trades. My main takeaway: Leave it to the pros. But if I get laid off and decide to become a day trader, I got a wee bit of starter education.\nI also paid closer attention to Trump’s company than I would have if I'd had no stake in it. The stock jumped after Trump said on Nov. 8 that he had no plan to sell his shares, as some of the company’s backers had feared. But other company insiders did sell shares, which seemed to drag down the stock. Three days after my Trump put expired, worthless, the stock was back to around $27, close, once again, to my strike price. I may have guessed right about the direction of the stock, even if I lost money on my bet.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-10-21T18:09:31.000Z",
        "article_content": "The so-called Trump trade is coming back as polls have started to tilt toward the former president in the election.\nAs a result of the electoral college’s peculiarities, even slight changes in presidential polls in just a handful of states could signal a decisive shift toward either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.\nAnd as the 2024 election enters the final stretch, polls could have more salience now. Election Day is Nov. 5, and early voting has already begun in some states, including in hotly contested Georgia and North Carolina.\nBased on 538’s latest analysis of presidential polls, Trump now has the barest advantage in the race, with a 52-in-100 chance to win. Two weeks ago, Harris had a 58-in-100 chance to win. Still, 538 cautions that the race remains in a dead heat.\nWhile Harris maintains a slight lead in nationwide polls, it has narrowed in October. In addition, her leads in the key swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Nevada have also shrunk or vanished, while Trump has added to his leads in Georgia and North Carolina.\nTo be sure, many presidential polls in the past few cycles were well off the mark (and often underestimated Trump’s support). As a result, some election watchers have turned to betting markets for a more accurate reading, arguing that those who put money on the line have a greater incentive to make an accurate call.\nBut recent a big shift on top prediction sites like Polymarket raised doubts about their accuracy as a few deep-pocketed bettors appeared to sway the odds toward Trump.\nThen there’s actual financial markets, which try to anticipate election results as much as possible given that the next president could put trillions of dollars at stake.\nDuquesne Family Office founder and hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller pointed to financial markets when he was asked about the election this past week, saying they appear “very convinced Trump is going to win.”\nKey market signals include the Trump trade. When the former president looked like the favorite earlier this year, the U.S. dollar, Treasury yields, Bitcoin, and shares of Trump Media and Technology rose.\nThey retreated after Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Harris took his place on the Democratic ticket. But since October began, the Trump trade has rebounded.\nThe U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of top global currencies, has rallied 2% so far this month. The 10-year Treasury yield has surged about 40 basis points. That’s as Trump’s tariffs and tax cuts are expected to boost the dollar and deepen U.S. debt, putting upward pressure on bond yields.\nBitcoin has jumped 12% in October. Trump has rebranded himself as a champion of the crypto industry after previously dismissing Bitcoin as a “scam.”\nAnd shares of Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, have shot up 83% so far in October. The stock has already been on a wild ride this year, acting like a barometer of Trump’s election prospects. It skyrocketed following Trump’s first debate with Biden in June and again after Trump survived an assassination attempt in July.\nBut after Biden stepped aside, Trump Media stock tumbled, then sold off further last month as the end of the lockup period approached, allowing company insiders to sell their shares.\nOther parts of the Trump trade have been mixed, largely owing to factors beyond the election. Energy stocks, which could benefit from lighter GOP regulation, have been relatively flat after oil prices jumped then sank on the outlook for a wider conflict between Israel and Iran.\nThe financial and health sectors could also see less regulation under Trump. But insurance stocks slumped after UnitedHealth gave weak guidance in its earnings report, while bank stocks jumped on strong quarterly results.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) was briefly halted several times in early trading on Tuesday, but shares still managed to extend their five-week surge, rising nearly 10%.\nThe volatile stock moves come as investors bet on improved chances that Donald Trump will win the November presidential election, set for a week from Tuesday.\nTuesday's gains built on a more than 21% gain Monday following the former president and Republican nominee's highly criticized rally at Manhattan's Madison Square Garden (MSG) over the weekend. At current levels, the stock is trading at its highest level since May, with shares up about 270% from their September lows.\nTrump's rally sparked backlash from both sides of the political aisle after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made inflammatory jokes about Latinos and the Black community, while anti-immigration comments also dominated headlines.\nThe surge in DJT stock is unlikely to continue beyond the short term. One current investor warned that if Trump loses the election next week, shares of DJT could plunge to $0.\n\"It's a binary bet on the election,\" Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts show on Monday.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nTuttle, who currently owns put options on the stock, said the trajectory of shares hinges on \"a buy the rumor, sell the fact\" trading strategy.\n\"I would imagine that the day after him winning, you'd see this come down,\" he surmised. \"If he loses, I think it goes to zero.\"\nShares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, have seen a recent rise as both domestic and overseas betting markets shift in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris.\nNational polls, however, show both candidates in an incredibly tight race, especially in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which are likely to decide the fate of the election.\nThe recovery in shares comes after the stock traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period last month. Shares had also been under pressure as previous polling in September saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president.\nTrump's recent campaign momentum, which recently included a stop at a local Pennsylvania McDonald's, followed an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July.\nTech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of next week's election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve \"with all the things he's got going on.\"\nMusk attended Sunday night's MSG event, along with UFC president Dana White, former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, among others.\nMeanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration. She appeared in Texas last week and was in Michigan on Monday, where she highlighted the Biden administration's CHIPS Act and its effects in the swing state.\nTrump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus.\nBut as Truth Social attempts to take on the social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question.\nIn August, DJT reported second quarter results that revealed a net loss of $16.4 million, about half of which was tied to expenses related to the company's SPAC deal. The company also reported revenue of just under $837,000 for the quarter ending June 30, a 30% year-over-year drop.\nEarlier this month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September.\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $52 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $10.3 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $6.2 billion.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Spending in the 2020 presidential campaign reached $14.4 billion, according to OpenSecrets.com.\nWith billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk digging deep into their pockets for this year’s election, donations could play a larger role than ever before. Musk committed to giving Republican candidate Donald Trump $45 million per month through a new super PAC, according to the Wall Street Journal.

This support from tech giants could help Harris at the polls.\nEmployees at Amazon, notably corporate employees, have donated more to political campaigns than have employees at other large retail organizations, including Walmart, Reuters reported.\nTrump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: How Would That Impact You If You Are Retired?\nAlthough there are no public reports of Bezos donating directly to the Harris campaign in 2024, a look at his donation history at OpenSecrets indicates he has donated thousands to Democrats in the past (with a few donations to Republicans, as well).\nAdditionally, due to a software glitch, Amazon Alexa devices reportedly gave a glowing recommendation for Harris as the next U.S. President while refusing to endorse any political party or leader when users asked for reasons to vote for Trump. The error was quickly fixed, however, as videos circulated the internet in early September.\nAdditionally, an exclusive report from Variety revealed that Amazon is in talks with news anchor Brian Williams to host a live Election Night special on Amazon Prime Video. The goal, according to Variety, is to “have a non-partisan discussion of the evening’s events.”\nHowever, given Amazon’s track record for backing Democratic candidates, this coverage, if it occurs, could sway voters at the last minute and potentially steer election results.\nBezos is not the only Silicon Valley tech giant or billionaire to support Harris. Melinda French Gates and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings donated to Harris’ campaign, with the latter giving $7 million, according to a report at The Information.\nShark Tank investor Mark Cuban also voiced his support for Harris as President, sharing in an X post, “She is pro-business.

        "article_content": "The 2024 election will be here before you know it, and economists are watching it closely.\nIf Donald Trump wins a second term, some experts believe it could affect the U.S.’s inflation trajectory — that a second Trump term would mean higher tariffs, deficits and other policies that would increase inflation. While forecasting economic conditions isn’t an exact science, experts can speculate using knowledge about the past and some clues about the future.\nLearn More: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: How Would That Impact You If You Are Retired?\nFind Out: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nA new report from Allianz Research provides insights into how inflation could unfold under a Trump 2.0 presidency. The report shows that while some policies could increase inflation in the short term, the overall inflation path would be shaped by factors like the Federal Reserve’s actions and broader economic conditions.\nGOBankingRates spoke to Maxime Darmet, senior U.S. economist at Allianz Trade, who co-authored a recent report by Allianz Trade research, titled “Trumponomics: the Sequel” on this very subject.\nLet’s dig a little deeper into what inflation might look like in a second Trump term.\nTrending Now:\nBoomers Have the Wealth--Why Are Thousands Still Homeless?\nSuze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nThe next president has their work cut out for them when dealing with inflation. The U.S. economy has been pretty sturdy lately, despite interest rates climbing.\n“While the U.S. has remained remarkably resilient despite rising interest rates and global uncertainty, it has become more prone to inflation volatility, given a larger exposure to frequent supply shocks and structural labor shortages,” Darmet said. “Against this backdrop, demand-boosting policies — such as tax cuts — or supply-hurting policies — such as tariff hikes — could re-ignite inflation faster and push up interest rates.”\nTrending Now: Trump Wants To Eliminate Social Security Taxes: Here’s How Much the Average Retiree Would Save\nWhoever takes the Oval Office in 2025 should tread carefully with their economic plans. Big tax cuts might sound great at first — they put more cash in your wallet. But if there are limited goods to spend that money on, it easily overheats the economy and spirals inflation even higher.\nIf Trump does end up back in the White House, it seems likely that he would double down on protectionist policies to boost U.S. manufacturing. He has proposed tariff increases, including 10% on all imports and 60% on Chinese goods.\nThe Allianz report discusses two potential scenarios — one in which the U.S. tariff rate rises from 2.5% up to 4.3%. However, another scenario, in which Trump implements all the tariffs he has threatened, could push the rate to around 12%.\n“However, in both cases, we would expect Trump to target goods that are not critical for the U.S. economy, equivalent to 55% of imported Chinese goods and 70% of EU goods,” Darmet wrote. “China’s textiles sector and the U.S. transportation equipment sector would be the hardest hit.”\nSo maybe cars and electronics stay relatively unscathed, while China’s clothing exporters take the brunt. But even with that targeted approach, the consensus is that it will act as a dreaded inflation bomb. In this case, the report predicts inflation could increase by 0.6 percentage points.\nOf course, Trump wouldn’t exactly be working with a fresh economic slate if he retakes the White House. He’d be inheriting the budget situation from Biden’s term.\n“A Trump 2.0 presidency would inherit very large fiscal deficits from the Biden administration and rising interest expenses,” Darmet wrote.\nTrump’s bold promises of slashing taxes and ramping up spending could quickly run into some harsh fiscal realities. He’ll have to perform some nifty accounting tricks to pull off his economic vision without sending bond market investors into a total panic over the stability of America’s finances. One potential gambit would be to hike all those tariffs and trade taxes to fund the tax cut promises while scaling back Biden’s pricier policy initiatives.\nSo unless the Trump 2.0 economy is some world-beater of growth, most forecasters see the new administration ultimately having to pump the brakes on fiscal loosening after maybe a year of smaller tax cuts or spending bumps.\nOtherwise, the whole economic agenda could wind up crumbling under the weight of unsustainable budgets and debt — something that fiscal conservatives in Trump’s party would likely refuse to accept. That deficit dynamic keeps economic advisors up at night as they game-plan Trump’s potential second term.\nTrump has said a goal is to ramp up U.S. manufacturing and reduce foreign manufacturing relationships. However, the report suggests that such policies need to be carefully designed.\n“To yield benefits, industrial policy must avoid the risk of targeting too many objectives. In that respect, Trump’s ambitious Strategic National Manufacturing Initiative (SNMI) may disappoint when set against its numerous goals and the reality that the U.S. does not have a competitive advantage in many sectors,” Darmet wrote.\nThe Fed’s response would shape inflation under a second Trump term.\n“Against this backdrop, we would expect the Federal Reserve to be forced to pause its easing cycle in 2025 and the U.S. 10-year yield to stay above 4%,” Darmet wrote.\nThis could control inflation but weigh on growth and markets initially. The report highlights the delicate balance the Fed would face between inflation and economic impacts.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

This is a $125,000 increase from five years prior and a $161,100 increase from a decade ago.\nThe U.S. housing market has fluctuated over the years, but the overall trend has been a steady — sometimes sharp — incline. Along with that, mortgage interest rates have risen over the years. Whereas the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hovered around 3% to 4% about a decade ago, it has risen to 5% to 7% over the past two years.\nLearn More: 7 Reasons You Must Speak to a Financial Advisor To Boost Your Savings in 2024\nCheck Out: I’m an Economist — Here’s My Prediction for Social Security if Trump Wins the 2024 Election\nFor those who want to buy a house, knowing how much it costs is only part of the bigger picture. It’s just as important to understand what influences the price of real estate — as well as interest rates and other expenses.\nWith the upcoming presidential election, you might be wondering what’ll happen to the U.S. housing market in the coming years. GOBankingRates spoke with Joseph Favorito, a financial planner and managing partner at Landmark Wealth Management, to get his thoughts.\nHere’s what a Donald Trump presidency could mean if you plan to buy property in 2025.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nSimply put, the next president might not have much of a direct impact on the U.S. housing market.\n“I think the presidential election is likely to have little impact on the housing market and markets in general,” Favorito said. “Policy positions have a greater impact on the economy than the market. While they are connected, I tend to [think] of the markets and the economy more like cousins than siblings. Policy has a greater impact on the small business owner and consumer directly than it does on the national direction of homes prices or the stock market.”\nThat said, a Trump presidency could bring about policy changes that affect the housing market in more indirect ways — or over a longer period of time. Changes to housing supply, employment rates and the like can all impact the cost — and availability — of real estate.\nIn terms of policy, Trump has done a few things that could be used as a basis for predicting what might happen if he ends up back in office.\nFor example, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 into law during his first term. This law increased after-tax income for qualifying individuals and businesses, which could mean more money for purchasing a home — though it depends on the local real estate market and other factors.\nPreviously, Trump also prioritized deregulation and tax cuts. This could mean greater economic growth, which could in turn increase disposable income for many Americans. This also could increase housing demand, though it might not make homes more affordable.\nDiscover More: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes — Here’s What That Would Mean for the Economy and Your Wallet\n“Housing, like any other asset class, is based on supply and demand,” Favorito said. “There is still a shortage of inventory relative to the population. That — coupled with the fact that more than 75% of existing home loans are below 5% [APR], and nearly 25% are below 3% — is keeping a good degree of supply off the market.”\nA few years ago, Freddie Mac conducted a study about the housing supply shortage. In that study, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, Sam Khater, illustrated that supply was short even before the pandemic.\nThere was a housing shortage of approximately 2.5 million homes in 2018. In 2020, there was a shortage of around 3.8 million units. The housing stock deficit rose by about 52% during these two years.\nBut why did supply dip?\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the main factors include a lack of available construction labor, land use regulations, zoning restrictions and an increase in raw material costs. A lack of entry-level homes, which first-time buyers also tend to gravitate toward, also might have led to this problem.\nMortgage interest rates hit a record low in the 2010s, and a lot of people who locked in such low rates during that time are hesitant to sell because rates are so much higher now. But that’s not the only reason the housing supply is low right now — and housing prices are up. Long-term federal policies have had an impact, too.\n“If you were locked in at 2.5% on a 30-year loan, you’re less likely to put your home on the market and take on a new purchase when the current rates are closer to 6%. The fact that the Fed kept rates so low for nearly two decades has led to a number of unusual market dislocations,” Favorito said. “Having such a resilient residential housing market is one of them. Ordinarily, such a big percentage increase in rates as we have seen since 2022 would have had a much bigger impact on home prices. But past policy is still keeping a lot of supply off the market.”\nRegardless of whether Trump is elected president, the changes to the housing market are more likely to be regional as opposed to nationwide. They could also rise or decline.\n“Housing tends to be very regional, and some areas that have had major price increases may see somewhat of a decline as the economy continues to slow,” Favorito said. “But I would be surprised if home prices fell anything like what happened in 2008, regardless of who is president. The dynamics of residential real estate looks much more stable than that of commercial real estate.”\nGiven that, if you’re looking to invest in commercial real estate, you may want to pay closer attention to the trends and the election. For the typical homebuyer purchasing property in 2025, the state of the local economy, current supply and interest rates may be more influential to your decision.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

The reason? He’s nervous about what changes the next president may make to the capital gains tax, and wanted to get ahead of it.\nCheck Out: How Much Is President Joe Biden Worth As He Seeks Reelection?\nTry This: Owe Money to the IRS? Most People Don’t Realize They Should Do This One Thing\nIt’s easy to take this as a sign that you should sell off any stocks you hold that have increased in value, before the 2024 presidential election, as well.\nHowever, the financial decision of a power player like Buffett may or may not apply to your own personal investments. Experts explain whether you should or should not sell off stocks before the 2024 presidential election.\nJustin Godur, finance advisor and CEO and founder of Capital Max, pointed out that capital gains rates are not set in stone, but can fluctuate based on legislative changes, which, yes, are often influenced by the economic policies of the administration in power.\nLearn More: 5 Presidents Who Raised Taxes the Most, and 5 Who Lowered Them\n“With a presidential election on the horizon, the uncertainty around tax policy is higher than usual. If the new administration decides to raise capital gains taxes, waiting to sell could mean paying a much higher tax rate on your gains,” he explained.\nHe posed a hypothetical scenario: imagine you’re currently facing a 20% capital gains tax. If you sell a stock that has appreciated $50,000, you would owe $10,000 in taxes. However, if tax rates increase to 30% under a new government, the same sale would cost you $15,000 in taxes. Selling now, in a lower tax environment, could save you $5,000.\nFurthermore, selling earlier can give you more control over your financial planning, Godur said.\n“By realizing your gains now, you can reinvest the proceeds into other, potentially less volatile, assets or diversify your portfolio to reduce risks associated with market fluctuations.”\nThis proactive approach not only secures your gains but also positions you for greater financial stability, regardless of how tax rates shift in the future.\nEven putting the actual tax rates aside, speculation about such changes can also affect the market now, according to Michael Collins, CFA and founder of WinCap Financial.\n“The financial markets generally dislike uncertainty. If there’s speculation or uncertainty about potential tax policy changes, it could lead to increased market volatility.”\nWhile nobody has a crystal ball that tells you the future, selling stocks before any potential changes in tax policy or market fluctuations can help mitigate this uncertainty and reduce the risk associated with sudden market movements, Collins said.\n“Selling stocks sooner allows you to lock in your investment gains at the current tax rate,” noted Collins.\nSince markets can be unpredictable, waiting too long to sell could result in missing out on potential gains or even experiencing losses if market conditions deteriorate.\nYou can also think of selling as just another adjustment to your investment portfolio, not necessarily driven by fear of tax rate increases. “By selling stocks that have appreciated in value, you can rebalance your portfolio and potentially reallocate funds into investments with better tax efficiency or more aligned with your long-term financial goals,” said Collins.\nEven if there’s no certainty about the timing or specifics of potential tax changes, selling stocks sooner rather than later provides flexibility and allows you to execute your investment strategy on your terms, Collins advised.\n“Trying to time the market perfectly is challenging, and taking proactive steps based on potential policy changes can be a prudent approach.”\nGodur said that the decision to sell stocks should be based on thorough analysis and tailored to your personal financial situation.\n“However, understanding and anticipating changes in tax laws is a crucial part of this decision-making process. By acting now, you can optimize your investment outcomes before potential tax hikes decrease your returns.”\nOn the other hand, just selling your stocks to get ahead of potential capital gains taxes might not be the wisest move, according to Joe Camberato, CEO of National Business Capital, a national lending platform.\n“I wouldn’t recommend selling stocks just because of a presidential election. You should only consider selling if you really think the stock has peaked, if you no longer think the company is a good investment, or if you want to take some profits off the table after the stock has reached a certain return. If you still believe in the company, then holding onto your stocks might be the best move, regardless of the election.”\nThough Biden has proposed increasing the capital gains tax percentage, Camberato doesn’t think the increase will pass. “If they do raise the capital gains tax bracket, it could discourage people from investing their money.”\nHao Dang, an investment strategist at Consilio Wealth, agrees with Camberato.\n“Investors should give very little weight to a presidential election when deciding to sell a stock or not. A better reason to sell could be risk reduction, not because of the election, but rather stocks have done well recently and it could be time to trim.”\nHe pointed out that both key presidential candidates have overseen good and bad markets. “Trump had good years in 2017 and 2019. He had bad years in 2018 and 2020. Biden had good years in 2021 and 2023. He had a bad year in 2022.”\nFrom his perspective, good and bad years are driven by many other factors that carry more weight than who is president. “The stock market will chug along with ups and down regardless of who wins.”\nIn a nutshell, if your stock has peaked, you’re worried about higher capital gains, or now is a good time to take profits from stock sales and invest them elsewhere, then it’s probably a good time to sell. Otherwise, hold tight and see what comes after November, 2024.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Expensive Costco Items That Are Definitely Worth the Cost\nI'm a Bank Teller: 9 Reasons You Should Never Ask for $2 Bills From the Bank\n5 Reasons You Should Consider an Annuity For Your Retirement Savings\n5 Myths About Debt That Nobody Should Believe in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why You Should Sell Off Stocks Before the Presidential Election"

She has said she will not raise taxes on Americans who earn less than $400,000 a year and that restoring the expansion of the child tax credit, along with a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with a child in their first year of life, is a priority for her administration. Finally, she has proposed a significant increase — from $5,000 to $50,000 — for new small businesses and down-payment support of up to $25,000 for first-time homebuyers.\nMinnesota has the country’s most progressive tax policies, while Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Vermont are also strong.

You can start this week.\nIt is no surprise that The Golden State is aligned with Harris’ potential policies, including those related to the environment, tax policies, labor protections and more.\nWith a strong track record of environmental protections and supporting communities excessively impacted by pollution, Harris was a big proponent of President Joseph Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act, which features several clean energy and electric vehicle incentives designed to reduce fossil fuel pollution and support sustainability. As part of the country’s role in the Paris Agreement, Harris’ administration would also have to determine how, when and where it will reduce environmental pollution.\nTo that end, California touts robust environmental protections and a deep commitment to combatting climate change, along with Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York and Florida.\nLearn More: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: How Would That Impact You If You Are Retired?\nThe Land of Lincoln scores well on support for workers’ rights, which Harris has long backed. She recently said at a rally in Detroit, “We know that unions built the middle class” and cheered the strength of workers’ organizations.\nIt also excels with its statewide focus on education. Calling education a “fundamental right” in her 2019 campaign kickoff, Harris has previously noted her desire for universal pre-K education and free college for certain federal jobs. She has also called for an increase in teacher pay nationally and supported the current administration’s plans to reduce student debt. Finally, she recently advocated for policies that would cut college degree requirements for certain jobs.\nIllinois has voted Democrat in the last eight elections and has become a reliable blue state.\nAnother Democratic stalwart, New York aligns with much of Harris’ proposed agenda. In fact, it will be hard to find many places where statewide politics don’t match up with the plans that Harris has for the nation.\nA commitment to education: check. A focus on protecting the environment: check. Workers’ protections: check. Liberal social policies: check, check, check. New York is among many East Coast states that match up with much of Harris’ potential agenda.\nSmall but mighty, Massachusetts comes through on progressive social and economic issues alike. It ranks first when it comes to Harris’ social issues and proposed policies, such as a woman’s right to choose, support for transgender rights and gay marriage, affordable housing and more. It was the first state in the nation to offer a right-to-shelter law, guaranteeing homeless people a place to sleep and the first to legalize gay marriage. If you are voting for Harris, you can’t go wrong with Massachusetts.\nIf you are curious about where your state comes in, a map of conservative versus liberal states can help you identify places you may want to move if Harris is elected president.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "Not only have polls and prediction markets tilted recently toward Donald Trump winning the presidential election, they are also pointing to Republicans flipping the Senate and retaining control of the House.\nA GOP sweep would give Trump a freer hand to enact his agenda. While U.S. presidents have broad authority on immigration and tariffs, changes to tax and spending policies would require congressional approval.\nThe latest polling analysis from 538 gave Trump a 53-in-100 chance of winning the election versus 47 out of 100 for Kamala Harris. It also gave Republicans an 87-in-100 chance of taking the Senate majority away from Democrats and a 53-in-100 chance of holding the House.\nPrediction markets are showing similar odds for Congress and wider odds for the White House. According to Kalshi, Trump has a 62% chance of winning the presidential election, with the GOP's odds of winning the Senate and House at 85% and 52%, respectively.\nMeanwhile, the new IBKR Forecast Trader from Interactive Brokers puts Trump's odds of victory at 63%, while Democrats have just 13% odds of holding the Senate and 48% of flipping the House.\nThat's a sharp reversal of fortune from the summer, when Kamala Harris and Democrats were riding a wave of enthusiasm after she took over the top of the ticket from President Joe Biden. Top pollster Frank Luntz attributed the loss of momentum to her campaign's shift in strategy toward a more anti-Trump message and away from a pro-Harris one.\nFor the economy and financial markets, a Republican sweep in November could raise the stakes even higher.\nThat’s as the former president has teased a range of tax cuts and even eliminating income taxes altogether in favor of replacing revenue with tariffs, which could worsen federal deficits.\nHis promises to hike tariffs across the board and begin mass deportations of undocumented immigrants are also seen as inflationary, potentially adding pressure on the Fed to keep rates higher for longer.\nTrump and his allies have also signaled plans to have more influence over Fed policies and the appointment of Fed policymakers, which require Senate approval.\nThe past week's market selloff was due in part to election jitters as \"red sweep talk is occurring all over Wall Street and Washington,\" wrote José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, in a note on Wednesday.\nIn addition, Yardeni Research also sees \"bond vigilantes\" throwing their weight around in financial markets, pointing to the recent surge in U.S. Treasury yields. While they oppose the Federal Reserve's half-point rate cut last month, investors are also assessing the fiscal outlook.\n“The Bond Vigilantes may also be voting against Washington, figuring that no matter which party wins the White House and the Congress, fiscal policies will bloat the already bloated federal government budget deficit and heat up inflation,” wrote Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, and Eric Wallerstein, the firm’s chief markets strategist. “The next administration will face net interest outlays of over $1 trillion on the ballooning federal debt.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-10-31T14:55:57.000Z",
        "article_content": "We have a treat for you this week: We're going to skip right past the election.\nLooking ahead to the post-November 5th world, three Analyst Days caught our team's attention. NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI), CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) each hold events that may shed light on key cyclical areas of the global economy.\nThere's heightened uncertainty right now, and not just regarding who will be the 47th POTUS. Global demand for semiconductors appears robust - Jensen Huang even used the word insane to describe what's going on at NVIDIA[1] - but that may indeed be due to the secular artificial intelligence story. Other more traditional use areas of chips could be seeing a slowdown. Elsewhere, there are few measures seen more as a macro bellwether than rail freight carload trends.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with DASH.\nNo matter who resides in the White House three months from now, they might inherit a decent economy by most gauges, though some metrics may be losing steam on the margin, along with soft sentiment among households. GDP growth has been solid throughout the year, and the third quarter could print above 3% on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis.[2] As with so many indicators, however, there's nuance here. While the services sector is on the mend the manufacturing sector has its struggles, at least according to the latest set of PMI numbers published by the Institute for Supply Management and S&P Global.[3]\nBut we are now more than three weeks into Q4. Investors and portfolio managers must look ahead to what the macro picture will be. Upcoming Analyst Days may offer such clues.\nShares of the $59 billion market cap tech stock have trodden water for much of 2024 after an intra-year pop and drop. NXPI hit a high just below $300 after notching a bear-market low below $140 24 months ago. Perhaps the biggest highlight was actually a lowlight this past July. NXP issued a generally disappointing Q2 report; non-GAAP EPS of $3.20 nearly hit the street's expectation of $3.21, but the stock fell 7.6% in the session that followed, according to data from Option Research & Technology Services (ORATS).[4]\nDespite broad tailwinds in the semiconductor industry, NXP's second-quarter revenue was down 5% on a year-over-year basis. CEO Kurt Sievers noted that the company navigated a cyclical trough in the industry and that sequential growth is forecast to resume.[5]\nEurope's biggest technology company ASML plunged following the early release of its Q3 report on October 15. Disappointing bookings figures drove home the point that the semis space can go through significant macro-related swings.[6] For NXP, its earnings report confirmed for Monday, November 4 AMC will be closely watched. ORATS reports a consensus EPS forecast of $3.43.[7] It then hosts NXP Semiconductors N.V. Investor Day 2024 the following Thursday.\nWe'll get back to the chips theme in a minute, but let's jump the tracks to CSX. The Jacksonville-based Industrials-sector stock is likewise off its YTD high, perhaps pressured by about-flat rail traffic compared with this time a year ago.[8] It reported disappointing Q3 results on October 16, but the release came after an impressive rally off its October lows.[9]\nTransports as a group have caught a bid lately; Dow Theory would suggest that the development means good things for the overall stock market. The Dow Jones Transportation Index poked to a 52-week high last week on the heels of positive earnings reaction to many airline stocks.[10]The onus remains on transports bulls to lift the index above its all-time high notched in 2021's fourth quarter.\nWe will see how that plays out in the final two-plus months of 2024. Following a weak response to its third quarter report, investors will likely keep an eye on CSX's November 7 Investor Day. It could be the final business update of the year based on our corporate event data deck.\nComments from its management team will be particularly interesting from the standpoint of the significant disruptions following the Southeast's one-two tropical gut-punch from Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\nFrom the transport of goods via trains to the transport of data through semiconductors, ASML de-railed last week. It released Q3 results a day earlier than expected due to a technical error.[11] Last quarter's realized net bookings and the bleak 2025 sales outlook rattled the chip industry. ASML, the stock, fell more than 16% last Tuesday in response to the release, and the losses only mounted on Wednesday, though many of its peers snapped back.[12]\nGeopolitical tensions and uncertainty about what the new year might bring were said to be the driver of the tepid forecast. Export restrictions on China were specifically cited on the earnings call by Roger Dassen, ASML's CEO.[13] It was a reminder that bullish AI sentiment may be long-lasting, but other global economic forces can still assert themselves. Chip companies caught a big bid last Thursday, though, after strong (perhaps reassuring) Q3 results and an upbeat outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).[14]\nInvestors may get more details on ASML's outlook at the company's November 14 Investor Day event. Its management team is then slated to present at five conferences from November 18 through December 3.\nIt's a common media refrain that uncertainty runs high ahead of US elections. That seems to be a reality when scanning trends among economically sensitive industries today. Investors should not only parse earnings reports in the next few weeks, but also pay close attention to insights at Analyst Days on tap.\n1 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Says Demand for Its Chips Is Insane', Investopedia, Kara Greenberg, https://www.investopedia.com2 GDPNow, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, October 18, 2024, https://www.atlantafed.org3 United States Services PMI, Trading Economics, October 16, 2024, https://tradingeconomics.com4 NXPI, ORATS, October 16, 2024, https://dashboard.orats.com5 NXP Semiconductors Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results, NXP Semiconductors, July 22, 2024, https://media.nxp.com6 ASML just gave us a first glimpse into how U.S. chip export curbs will dent its China sales, CNBC, Ryan Browne, October 16, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com7 NXP, ORATS, October 16, 2024, https://dashboard.orats.com8 AAR reports rail traffic for the week ending October 12, 2024.

        "title": "Donald Trump gains the upper hand in the prediction markets—an indicator more accurate than polls, expert claims",
        "date": "2024-10-15T19:29:26.000Z",
        "article_content": "In the words of Yogi Berra, \"it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\" But the Dad-joke favored baseball icon was blissfully unaware of crypto.\nElection day looms, in the spirit of spooky season, like a ghoul or ghost around the corner. But while predicting the future can be a fool’s game, Americans are scrambling for any insight regarding what might be one of the closest elections in recent history—and unprecedented times call for unprecedented sources.\nFor the 2024 presidential election, it might be wise to not just look to the polls, but also check out prediction markets. “The markets tend to be the single best piece of information available out there,” Rutgers professor of statistics, Harry Crane, told Fortune.\nPolls are tight, but Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris is pulling slightly ahead of Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump, according to Morning Consult’s weekly poll, which cites Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight data. The prediction markets paint a different picture, though, and perhaps a more accurate one, Crane claims.\nPrediction markets website PredictIt currently places Trump ahead of Harris—and elsewhere, on the crypto side of the world, Trump is in the lead as well. Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction marketplace, currently shows Trump ahead in the presidential election by 57.7% to 41.9%. Harris, though, is projected by the same site to win the popular vote by 61.9% to 37.8%.\n“Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,” Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune’s Shawn Tully. While they don’t necessarily have a wider scope, these markets can predict the future better than polls as they have an economic incentive, Crane adds. “The poll is asking you who you're going to vote for… nobody cares who you're going to vote for. What people care about is who's going to win,” he said.\nHaving studied the cash markets of PredicIt’s accuracy previously, Crane says “those markets are actually pretty accurate, at least more accurate than polling aggregators at 538 and so on.” But crypto, surprisingly enough, carries even more weight.\nCash prediction markets beat out polls and crypto prediction markets beat out cash \nCrypto might be drying off in terms of public interest, but it's found a particular niche in the prediction market world. As it stands, slightly more than $1.9 billion in crypto has been traded on the site.\nBoth markets have a “skewed demographic,” notes Crane, explaining that they’re often male-dominated and many don’t even have Americans in them. And not everyone is an active trader, as people often place small bets at one point and do not return. Even so, they carry more weight than polls, he says. Of course, Trump has more favor with those in the crypto sector, which could possibly be tilting the scales in his favor on said site. But as Crane points out, other non-crypto prediction markets like Betfair and Kalshi are mostly in line with Polymarket.\n“If I had to pick one market it would be Polymarket to be the closest to the best single estimate,” said Crane, adding that he tries to take a consensus market price. But just as there is a margin of error in polls, there’s a margin of inefficiency in prediction markets, per Crane,\nAccording to his calculations, Polymarket has the smallest margin of inefficiency at 1.33% compared to 11.08% for PredictIt. PredictIt has a 10% commission on profitable trades and also some regulations like limiting betting to $850 per trader and 5,000 participants in any given market. “The markets with higher liquidity, less lower fee structure, and less regulatory restrictions are the ones that tend to be the most accurate,” Crane said, which leads to Polymarket gaining an edge.\nWhile Polymarket hasn’t been around or studied for as long as PredictIt, Crane says if you forced him to bet on it, he’d say the former is shaping up to be more accurate this cycle. But that “doesn't mean Trump's going to win.” Rather, it’s “a good signal, and a more accurate signal than what I would expect from PredictIt,” Crane said.\nJust this past month, prediction markets Kalshi and Interactive Brokers have come online legally in the U.S. These markets, which are restricted to U.S. participants, are less restricted in trading than PredictIt, but still slightly more likely to have a greater margin of inefficiency according to Crane’s calculations. In the long-term, though, these markets might edge out Polymarket as it’s easier to use and perhaps less alienating than crypto, explains Crane.\nFoul play might be possible in these prediction markets though, as the New York Times’ Dealbook points to large bets in favor of Trump from single users as well as Elon Musk’s comments about prediction markets. Acknowledging said allegations, Crane notes there’s a difference between someone who is buying a lot of shares of something and someone who is intentionally trying to manipulate the market. In the latter case, the market will often correct themselves. He doubts this is necessarily the case though since other prediction markets and polls have warmed up to Trump in various ways.\nWho wins is really still “anyone’s guess.” But crypto might be better at adapting to volatility in such a tight race. Either way, Polymarket is shaping up to be a short-term glimpse into the future. “Polls are probably going to continue to be in Trump's favor, at least for the next week. And the reason I say that is because the markets are tending to be about a week ahead of the polls,” adds Crane.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "An individual or entity caused a brief mispricing on Polymarket by buying over 4.5 million Trump contracts for the 2024 Presidential Election, pushing the odds to 99% for a portion of the purchase due to the mechanics of the order book.\nThis anomaly occurred despite the actual market odds being around 63% at the time, highlighting how large trades can temporarily skew betting odds on prediction platforms.\nRepublican Donald Trump’s presidential victory odds on Polymarket spiked to 99% for one entity briefly earlier Friday, data shows, as their constant buying led to a temporary mispricing in the order book.\nThe \"GCorttell93\" account purchased over 4.5 million Trump contracts in the “Presidential Election Winner 2024” market spending over $3 million in a short period. However, due to how the orderbook works, a tranche of $275,000 was filled at 99% odds - a leap from the actual 63% offered odds at the time.\nThe rest of their bets were placed at varying prices, such as a $129,000 tranche at 65.9 cents and a $102,000 tranche at 62.7 cents.\nOn Polymarket, the price of shares in any outcome reflects the market's current belief in the likelihood of that outcome. If a 'Yes' share for an event costs $0.60, the market interprets this as a 60% chance of that event occurring.\nHowever, these odds are dynamic and change with each trade as Polymarket works on a blockchain-based order book that lists all the buy (bids) and sell (asks) orders for shares in an outcome.\nBids represent the highest price someone is willing to pay for a share, while asks are the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell.\nThis system allows for price discovery and provides liquidity. Users can place limit orders, where they specify the price they're willing to buy or sell, which might not execute immediately if there's no match.\nHowever, a market buy may lead to someone's bids getting filled at much higher prices.\nAs such, the order book allows everyone to see the depth of market interest at different price points, showing where other traders are willing to transact. This helps determine any bet’s true market price (compared to a centralized betting marketplace where brokers handle odds).\nThe election winner bet is the largest Polymarket by traded volume as of Friday, with over $2.2 billion in transactions. Trump leads the odds at 63%, while traders have given Democrat Kamala Harris a 36% chance of winning."

        "date": "2024-11-08T13:23:41.000Z",
        "article_content": "With Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election, the US and global renewable energy markets anticipate a potential storm ahead.\nThe election result has already sent tremors through the renewables industry. US solar stocks tumbled on Wednesday, with companies like First Solar dropping 10%, while Sunrun and Sunnova plunged more than 29% and 51%, respectively.\nDespite Trump not having made clear his stance on solar, investors reacted to his broader promise to eliminate green subsidies. The former president has pledged to dismantle the IRA, a cornerstone of Joe Biden’s $369bn clean energy initiative and a legislation that has played a key role in the expansion of renewables deployment in the country.\nOn the other hand, Trump’s disdain for wind power is no secret. He famously declared “I hate wind” and promised to halt offshore wind projects immediately upon returning to office. His Agenda47 policy platform reiterates his vow to “end all Joe Biden policies that disrupt energy markets... including the outrageous subsidies for wind energy”.\nTrump's victory reverberates far beyond US borders, sending shockwaves through global markets and testing international alliances. As his administration prepares to reverse climate policies and reshape the renewables landscape, both domestic and international markets brace for the wider implications for clean energy initiatives and geopolitical stability.\nIn addition to US renewables companies taking the hit, Trump’s victory has shaken global markets. European clean energy stocks fell sharply following the election, with wind turbine manufacturers Vestas and Nordex trading down around 11% and 7.6%, respectively, while Orsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer, saw a decline of up to 14%. \nThe US renewable energy market has long represented a significant growth opportunity for utility companies across the globe. Trump’s shift in policy could dampen this upward trajectory, alongside the global momentum on emission reductions.\n“The likely shift in US policy impacts global climate governance as US climate leadership pushes other major economies toward emission reduction commitments and supports developing countries in their green transitions,” says Paul Hasselbrinck, senior energy analyst at Power Technology’s parent company GlobalData.\nBeyond the stock market, Trump’s stance on renewables could strain alliances with key climate-focused partners such as the EU, Canada and Japan. Hasselbrinck points to US-Europe relations as being particularly vulnerable to “suffering from turbulence on the diplomatic side”, paired with “dwindling support for NATO and the unlikely easing of protectionist policies”.\nHe adds, however, that these geopolitical tensions may be counter-balanced by the US’ willingness to sell liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe and Europe’s demand for it, which could support the need for good relations. \n“However, as a result, European countries may find themselves under increased pressure to reduce overall gas demand, turning to renewables at a quicker pace to avoid being subject to the leverage of an administration that will be – at least partially – at odds with the Union’s stance on Russia-Ukraine conflict resolution, and increasingly, on Israel-Palestine.”\nChina’s control over critical minerals as well as the manufacture of energy-related equipment and infrastructure pose a significant challenge for the US renewables industry.\n“The supply chain vulnerabilities have been spotted: solar and wind-powered electricity generation requires the kind of critical materials that China overwhelmingly dominates,” Hasselbrinck says.\nFor instance, China is responsible for nearly 40% of the global share of processing for copper, which is essential for not only renewables but also nuclear, coal and natural gas. The Asian nation also dominates around 90% of global processing for manganese, used for onshore and offshore wind.\nHasselbrinck claims that Trump’s solution to this conundrum will “look radically different from his opposing candidate and predecessor” as the options of safeguarding a good relationship with China to avoid supply chain disruptions and price-controls, in addition to establishing strong strategic partnerships with other key suppliers, “will seem less enticing to him”.\nRather than fostering international partnerships or diversifying supply chains, Trump is likely to focus on reducing US reliance on imports by boosting domestic production of traditional energy sources, further sidelining renewables. This could exacerbate supply chain vulnerabilities, as clean energy industries remain dependent on critical minerals for which the US lacks immediate alternatives.\n“Trump’s practical – if not simplistic – approach means that renewables investments may decrease even more in response to uncertainty and lack of government support,” Hasselbrinck adds.\nDespite the concerns, all hope is not lost when it comes to the growth of renewables in the US.\nData from the Global Infrastructure Investor Association shows that the IRA has spurred around $115bn in investments and generated roughly 90,000 jobs, the majority of which benefitted Republican-led states.\nWhile this surge in investment and job creation is now in jeopardy considering Trump’s stance of renewables and the IRA, states that the bill has paid off for – many of which politically align with Trump – are likely to push back against his plans to gut the bill. With bipartisan recognition of its economic benefits, there is a strong possibility that at least parts of the IRA will survive his term.\nFurthermore, Trump’s opposition to the IRA conflicts with his fixation on curbing China's influence. \nThe solar industry has been a significant beneficiary of the IRA. According to the US Solar Market Insight Q3 2024 report, US solar module manufacturing capacity has surged nearly fourfold since the enactment of the IRA, rising from around 8GW in 2021 to more than 30GW. While this growth hasn't extended up the supply chain to include cells or wafers, it has helped reduce the US's dependence on China – an achievement that should satisfy the former president.\nThe nation has also almost doubled total installed solar capacity through the IRA’s support. GlobalData projects US cumulative solar capacity will reach 220.95GW by the end of the year, compared with 120.47GW in 2021.\nMeanwhile, China is expected to surpass 850GW of solar capacity by the end of 2024. If Trump’s administration fully enacts its agenda, the nation risks falling even further behind its Asian competitor in the clean energy race.\nIt is possible that this is simply a battle that Trump is willing to lose. Whether the US stalls its renewables growth and widens the gap between itself and global competitors will depend on the degree of resistance his policies face and how far they are implemented.\n\"Trump’s victory: US and global renewable markets brace for storm\" was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n \nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "title": "A mystery Polymarket trader bet major money that Trump would win—and it just paid off to the tune of $40 million",
        "date": "2024-11-06T23:37:11.000Z",
        "article_content": "Prediction markets proved themselves this election season. In the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election, what appeared to be a small group of traders dumped millions of dollars into Polymarket, betting that Donald Trump would win. It turns out it was just one French whale who had pushed tens of millions of dollars into the market, dramatically increasing Trump’s odds of winning—which he did.\nThat “prophecy” as many crypto proponents, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk called it, came true late into Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning. By about midnight EST, Trump’s odds of winning the presidential election according to the Polymarket contract, were above 90%. It’s unsurprising the market reacted so quickly—especially since there is money at stake, Luca Prosperi, CEO and cofounder of M^0, a protocol that allows global institutions to issue stablecoins, told Fortune. \n“While the media have their own reasons to delay or emphasize certain results, traders simply want to make money,” Prosperi said. “It is a bit like what happens in equity markets, where markets rather than research houses and commentaries are the fastest in absorbing new information from events such as earning releases.”\nPolymarket also issued a statement on Wednesday touting its “wisdom of markets over the polls, the media, and the pundits.” Its CEO Shayne Coplan said that, allegedly, the Trump campaign headquarters “literally found out they were winning from Polymarket.”\nRecently, Polymarket had added a provision on its presidential election market suggesting the market might not “resolve” (pay out)  until Inauguration Day. But since the Associated Press, Fox, and NBC all called the election for Trump, the market resolved around 11 a.m. EST on Wednesday. The total U.S. presidential contract, or market, had grown to a whopping $3.6 billion.\nAlthough the news outlets called the election before 11 a.m. EST Wednesday, there was a gap between when the market conditions were met and the market resolved. This was because a resolution had to be proposed on Polymarket’s current oracle and resolution source, UMA. Their dispute resolution system allows anyone to challenge a proposed market outcome by posting a bond during a two-hour challenge period, according to Coindesk. UMA token holders can vote to determine the final resolution if it’s disputed.\nBut now that the market has resolved, it’s time for payday.\nBetween two betting markets (the presidential election winner and who would win the popular vote), the Trump whale, which traded under usernames Fredi9999, PrincessCaro, Theo4, and Michie, netted about $40 million in profit, according to Polymarket Analytics. Alan Orwick, co-founder of blockchain Quai Network, confirmed to Fortune the French whale stands to gain more than $47 million in payouts from his investments in the Polymarket presidential market.\nThe way prediction markets work is by allowing traders to buy and sell shares on the outcome of a given event, and the bet is resolved only when the event actually happens. Polymarket users buy shares depending on which outcome they think is more likely. Share prices or “odds” rise and fall depending on demand. So if the event happens the way the trader predicted, the contract or “bet” will rise to $1 and pay out—or fall to $0 if it does not.\nWhile Polymarket users can theoretically cash out at any time based on the current market price, many held on until the bitter end and raked it in. But as Polymarket continues to grow in popularity, there are opportunities for user experience improvement, Orwick said.\n“Due to unexpectedly high traffic and demand, some have encountered technical difficulties in processing their claims, highlighting both the platform's popularity and the need for robust infrastructure to handle such volumes,” he said.\nEither way, last night and this morning proved prediction markets are likely to become an integral part of future political events.\n“Polymarket changed the political landscape, forever,” Polymarket chief marketing officer Matthew Modabber posted on X. “We’re just getting started.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "If 2023 was the year that AI finally broke into the mainstream, 2024 could be the year it gets fully enmeshed in our lives — or the year the bubble bursts.\nBut whatever happens, the stage is set for another whirlwind 12 months, coming in the wake of Hollywood’s labor backlash against automation; the rise of consumer chatbots, including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Elon Musk’s Grok; a half-baked coup against Sam Altman; early inklings of a regulatory crackdown; and, of course, that viral deepfake of Pope Francis in a puffer jacket.\nTo gauge what we should expect in the new year, The Times asked a slate of experts and stakeholders to send in their 2024 artificial intelligence predictions. The results alternated between enthusiasm, curiosity and skepticism — an appropriate mix of sentiments for a technology that remains both polarizing and unpredictable.\nWhen a surgeon or a stockbroker goes to work, they do so with the backing of a license or certification. Could 2024 be the year we start holding AI to the same standard?\n“In the next year, we may require AI systems to get a professional license,” said Amy Webb, chief executive of the Future Today Institute, a consulting firm. “While certain fields require professional licenses for humans, so far algorithms get to operate without passing a standardized test. You wouldn’t want to see a urologist for surgery who didn’t have a medical license in good standing, right?”\nRead more: A weirdly candid interview with Elon Musk's new AI chatbot, about Elon Musk\nIt’d be a development in line with political changes over the last few months, which saw several efforts to more conscientiously regulate this powerful new technology, including a sweeping executive order from President Biden and a draft Senate policy aimed at reining in deepfakes.\n“I’m particularly concerned about the potential impact [generative AI] could have on our democracy and institutions in the run-up to November’s elections,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who co-sponsored the deepfakes draft, said of the coming year. “Creators, experts and the public are calling for federal safeguards to outline clear policies around the use of generative AI, and it’s imperative that Congress do so.”\nRegulation isn’t just a domestic concern, either. Justin Hughes, a professor of intellectual property and trade law at Loyola Law School, said he expects the European Union will finalize its AI Act next year, triggering a 24-month countdown for broad AI regulations in the EU. Those would include transparency and governance requirements, Hughes said, but also bans on dangerous uses of AI such as to infer someone’s ethnicity and sexual orientation or manipulate their behavior. And as with many European regulations, the effects could trickle down to American firms.\nYet the rising calls for guardrails have already triggered a backlash. In particular, a movement known as effective accelerationism — or “e/acc” — has picked up steam by calling for rapid innovation with limited political oversight.\nJulie Fredrickson, a tech investor aligned with the e/acc movement, said she envisions the new year bringing further tensions around regulation.\n“The biggest challenge we will encounter is that using [tools that] compute IS speech and that raises critical constitutional issues here in the United States that any regulatory framework will need to deal with,” Fredrickson said. “The public must make our government understand that it cannot make trade-offs restricting our fundamental rights like speech.”\nRead more: Sam Altman tells Trevor Noah what he really thinks about his ouster, the dangers of AI and Taylor Swift\nImagine being able to know with certainty whether that vacation photo your friend just posted on Instagram was taken in real life or generated on a server farm somewhere.\nMike Gioia, co-founder of the AI workflow startup Pickaxe, thinks it might soon be possible. Specifically, he predicts Apple will launch a “Photographed on iPhone” stamp next year that would certify AI-free photos.\nOther experts agree that efforts to bolster trust and authenticity will only grow more important as AI floods the internet with synthetic text, photos and videos (not to mention bots aimed at imitating real people). Andy Parsons, senior director of Adobe’s Content Authenticity Initiative, said he anticipates the increased adoption of “Content Credentials,” or metadata embedded in digital media files that, almost like a nutrition label, would record who made something and with what tools.\nSuch stopgaps could prove particularly important as America enters a presidential election year — its first in history that will take place amid a torrent of cheap, viral AI media.\nBill Burton, former deputy press secretary for the Obama administration, predicted: “The most viewed and engaged videos in the 2024 election are generated by AI.”\nRead more: These filmmakers use AI. And they're not ashamed to admit it\nLast year brought substantial advances in AI technology, from the launch of mainstream products — ChatGPT, deemed the fastest-growing consumer app in history, released its fourth version — to continued breakthroughs in AI research and development.\nMany AI insiders think that pace of innovation will continue into the new year.\n“Every business and consumer app user will be using AI and they won’t know it,” said Ted Ross, general manager of the City of Los Angeles Information Technology Agency. “I predict that artificial intelligence features and high-visibility [generative] AI platforms, such as ChatGPT, will rapidly integrate into existing business and consumer applications with the user often unaware.”\nOther developments could be more niche but no less impactful. Some experts predict a rise in leaner and more targeted alternatives to the \"large language models\" that underlie ChatGPT and Grok. The AI itself could get better at self-improvement, too.\n“There hasn’t been a lot of tooling that targets speeding up AI research,” said Anastasis Germanidis, chief technology officer of the synthetic video startup Runway. “We’ll likely see more of those tools emerge in the coming year,” including to help write or debug code.\nRead more: Tom Hanks disavows AI clone amid Hollywood's robot reckoning\nThe AI market is frothy right now, but not everyone thinks the glory days can last.\n“A hyped AI company will go bankrupt or get acquired for a ridiculously low price” at some point in 2024, Clément Delangue, chief executive of the open source AI development community Hugging Face, wrote in a recent tweet.\nEric Siegel, a former Columbia University professor and the author of “The AI Playbook: Mastering the Rare Art of Machine Learning Deployment,” has struck an even warier tone.\n“There will be growing consternation as the lack of a killer [generative] AI app becomes increasingly apparent,” Siegel told The Times, referencing an app that would drive widespread adoption of AI. “Disillusionment will ultimately set in as today’s grandiose expectations fail to be met.”\nEventually, he warned, we could even enter an “AI Winter,” or a period of declining interest — and investment — in the technology.\nRead more: Senators draft policy aimed at deep fakes of Drake, Tom Hanks and noncelebrities\nBut that is probably still a few years away, he added: “The current ‘craze’ has built incredible momentum, and that momentum will continue to be fueled as new impressive-looking and potentially valuable capabilities continue to pop up.”\nEven the skeptics, it seems, anticipate a banner year for AI.\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times."

        "article_content": "Steep inflation has haunted Americans as our number one bogeyman over the last two and a half years.\n“We’ve experienced high inflation over the last three years because of how much money we flooded into our financial system as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” explains CFP and MBA Scott Sturgeon of Oread Wealth. “These include stimulus checks, PPP loans, quantitative easing, and other pandemic-era policies that lingered too long.\n“The more dollars there are pursuing the same goods and services, the more those goods and services will increase in price as a response.”\nCheck Out: I’m an Economist — Here’s My Prediction for Social Security If Trump Wins the 2024 Election\nRead Next: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nTrump’s proposed policies appears to be a mixed bag when it comes to their impact on inflation. Some would likely reduce it, while others would exacerbate it.\nConsider the push and pull of each as you consider future inflation rates.\nYou can also find out what may happen to the housing market if Trump is re-elected in November.\nTrending Now:\nBoomers Have the Wealth--Why Are Thousands Still Homeless?\nSuze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nSara Routhier, finance expert with FreeAdvice.com, sees a slow road ahead.\n“If Trump wins, it will most likely take two to three years to recover from the inflation we have seen over the last few years,” she said. “If [Kamala] Harris wins the election, there is a good chance that inflation will continue to rise.”\nSo which of Trump’s policies will help reduce inflation?\nLearn More: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes — How Would That Impact You If You Are Retired?\n“Trump’s tighter immigration policies should help reduce inflation,” observes Routhier. “The government would spend less on undocumented immigrants’ housing, medical expenses, and other assimilation costs.”\nReduced government spending isn’t the only reason why slower immigration would also slow inflation. Immigration fuels population growth, which in turn fuels economic growth through higher demand for goods and services.\nInflation goes hand in hand with hot economic growth, so reducing population growth and consumer demand should clamp down on inflation.\nAt rally after rally, Trump has promised to “drill baby drill” to increase domestic oil and gas production. Greater energy supply drives down energy prices, helping to reduce inflation.\nMelanie Musson, a finance expert with Clearsurance.com, points to lower US energy prices and fewer foreign imports. “If Trump is elected again, you can expect a shift away from foreign dependence, similar to his first presidency.”\nMore government spending means more money flooding into the economy. Read: inflation.\nHistorically, Republican candidates have proposed slimmer government spending, which can help cut inflation. That said, Donald Trump is by no means a classical conservative.\nTrump’s first administration continued to spend more each year, outspending the Obama Administration in every year, per The American Presidency Project.\nYou could make a case that a second Trump Administration would increase federal spending at a slower pace than a Harris Administration. But that argument rests on the “lesser of two evils” for exacerbating inflation, as opposed to a policy solution.\nMany of Trump’s policy proposals would increase inflation rather than continue taming it.\nDespite appointing Jerome Powell as the chair of the Federal Reserve, Donald Trump has been his fiercest critic. He told Fox Business earlier this year that he wouldn’t reappoint Powell, and accused him of being “political.”\nIn fact, Trump has gone so far as claiming the power to fire a sitting Fed chair, as reported by The Hill. He has repeatedly campaigned this year on lowering interest rates — which of course fuels inflation.\n“Higher interest rates have helped cool inflation by cooling down an overheated economy,” explained Sturgeon. And racing to slash interest rates too quickly can drive inflation rates right back up again.\nIt doesn’t take an economist to see that adding new taxes on imports makes those imported goods more expensive. Retailers don’t just eat those higher costs — they pass them on to consumers.\n“Broad tariffs typically raise prices for everyday goods,” said Paul Tyler from annuity provider Zinnia.\nTrump initially called for a 10% blanket tariff on all imports, which he has more recently raised to 20% as reported by CNBC. On Chinese imports, that rate would jump to 60%.\nThat spells inflation on imports for everyday consumers.\nTax cuts stimulate the economy by leaving consumers and companies more money to spend, grow, and hire.\nTo juice the economy, Trump has proposed extending the provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 indefinitely and reducing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.\nSometimes the economy does need stimulating. But when the economy is overstimulated — like it’s been for the last three years — that stimulus leads to inflation.\nGovernment regulation works like a throttle on the economy. When the government tightens regulation, it squeezes the flow of goods and services, while loosening regulation increases the flow.\nLike reducing taxes, reducing regulation stimulates the economy, which is in turn inflationary.\nDana Miranda, Certified Educator in Personal Finance and author at Healthy Rich, sees regulation as a check on retailers raising prices. “Corporate price gouging can be a major factor in inflation, and it can be addressed with regulation by federal agencies. Harris has proposed regulatory and tax increases on corporations. Trump’s policies favor corporations and likely wouldn’t wrangle inflation any better than it is now.”\nEach candidates’ policies would have a mixed effect on inflation. Don’t expect either candidate to wave a magic wand and make inflation disappear.\nInstead, expect a slow march back to 2% inflation — or a fast drop if the economy falls into recession.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "In September, the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle. However, that hasn’t discouraged investors from pouring money into U.S. money-market funds.\nAccredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\nAccording to Bloomberg, the assets under management in these mutual funds crossed a record $7 trillion last month. So they’re clearly still pretty popular despite the fact that they will deliver lower returns as interest rates are cut.\nIf you're feeling skittish about the economy in the wake of the recent election, you're probably not alone. You may gain some financial security by putting your cash into a money market fund. But you should know that there are some drawbacks to consider, too.\nSome people use the terms money market fund and money market account interchangeably. That's a mistake, since they're not the same thing.\nA money market account combines the features of a savings and checking account so you're able to earn a return on your money while also writing checks and taking cash withdrawals against your balance. Money market accounts get to enjoy FDIC protection of up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.\nA money-market fund (MMF), meanwhile, is a type of ultra low-risk mutual fund that doesn't come with FDIC protection. MMFs consist of relatively safe assets like short-term debt securities. So technically, you can lose money in an MMF, whereas you can't lose money in an FDIC-insured money market account provided your balance is $250,000 or less.\nIt may seem curious that investors are flocking to MMFs at this time. One possible reason is that they aren't expecting interest rates to come down significantly in the near future.\n\"Few people seriously expect a return to ZIRP (zero interest rate policy). Indeed, since the Fed started easing in September, markets have begun pricing in fewer cuts and the implied terminal rate has risen by around a full percentage point, and MMF inflows have accelerated. While there are myriad alternatives to MMFs, all come with downsides,\" explained Jamie McGeever of Reuters. \"Given the high levels of uncertainty surrounding the year ahead — from geopolitical tensions to questions about President-elect Donald Trump's unorthodox policy agenda – the environment is likely to remain cash-friendly.\"\n“There’s little in the data to justify cuts in the current environment of strong growth and sticky inflation, especially with uncertainty around tariffs and the potential for deregulation contributing to animal spirits,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. interest rates strategy at Societe Generale, to Bloomberg. “If that’s the case, what’s the rush to move money out of MMFs and into other assets?”\nRead more: Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2024\nA big part of President-elect Trump's campaign was putting an end to inflation. But with plans to impose tariffs on foreign goods and crack down on migrant workers, the fear is that inflation will pick up rather than slow down. In fact, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists penned a letter earlier this year warning that Trump's plans could cause a surge in inflation and lead to a less stable U.S. economy.\nDuring periods of economic upheaval, the stock market can be volatile. So an MMF may be a safer place to park cash right now. Economic instability could also drive unemployment rates upward. If you’re worried about job loss, choosing a fairly liquid investment like a money market fund could be wise, as you’d be able to expect easy access to your money should you need it in the absence of a paycheck.\nOf course, without a crystal ball, there’s no telling how the economy will fare in the next four years. But if your primary goal is stability, then adding money market funds to your portfolio could be a good bet.\nHowever, you don’t want to get your asset allocation wrong and miss out on potential long-term returns from riskier investments like the stock market. The main rule of investing is to maintain a balanced, diversified portfolio that's appropriate for your investing horizon and financial goals. A popular rule of thumb is that cash and cash equivalents should make up between 2% and 10% of your portfolio.\nMMFs allow you to grow your money in a relatively safe manner. These funds offer the upside of being very liquid, and they’re not as risky as other mutual funds. Depending on market conditions, you may be able to earn a better return in an MMF than from a savings account or CD.\nIf you’re saving for a specific goal that’s four years out, like buying a house or retiring, then an MMF could be an appropriate investment.\nAn MMF might seem like a great place to put your cash if you’re worried about near-term economic volatility. But there are some drawbacks to these funds you should know about.\nFirst, you don't get the same FDIC protection as a savings account or CD, yet you may not get so much of a better return that it’s worth giving that protection up. But perhaps the biggest disadvantage of an MMF is that you may be looking at only modest returns.\nOver a four-year period, playing it safe with your money makes sense if there’s a milestone like retirement coming up at the end of it. Otherwise, you may want to keep your money in an S&P index fund instead.\nSay you put $10,000 into an MMF over the next four years. If you earn 3% a year, you’ve grown your balance to about $11,250. If you put that same $10,000 into an S&P 500 index fund that gives you an 8% return, which is a notch below the stock market’s historical average, you’re looking at $13,600 instead.\nNow to be fair, there’s a flaw in this example. S&P 500 index funds are best suited for people with a longer investment horizon than four years. So if you only want to tie up cash for four years, then again, an MMF may be a sound choice.\nBut if you have a 10-year window before you might need to use your $10,000, then an MMF paying you 3% during that time grows your balance to about $13,400. An S&P 500 index fund paying 8% gets you to almost $21,600.\nThat being said, MMFs are a great way to diversify your portfolio with some safe and stable assets.\nCar insurance in America now costs a stunning $2,329/year on average — but here’s how 2 minutes can save you more than $600 in 2025\nRich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord.

        "article_content": "If you’re looking for a volatile stock to invest in this year, Trump Media and Technology Group, trading under symbol DJT, might fit the bill. The company went public via a special purpose acquisition group merger on March 26, 2024, and provides access to Truth Social, the social media company founded by former President Donald Trump.\nFind Out: If You Bought $1K of Elon Musk’s Favorite Crypto 5 Years Ago, Here’s How Much You Would Have NowRead More: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nThe stock shot up 41% right after it began trading, but it’s already given back all of those gains and more. As a company tied to one of the two candidates in the November presidential election, it’s likely that the stock will continue to be volatile throughout 2024. But is the company a good bet if Trump loses the election? Here’s a look at the financials of Trump Media and Technology Group, how the stock has been trading and the viability of the company as a long-term investment.\nTrending Now:\nBoomers Have the Wealth--Why Are Thousands Still Homeless?\nSuze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nTrump Media and Technology Group is the parent company of Truth Social. Trump created the social media company after being banned from both X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook in the wake of the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol, as reported by the Associated Press. Trump holds approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Truth Social, making him the majority shareholder.\nAfter spiking over 40% immediately after it began trading, DJT has been in a major downtrend. On April 10, 2024, the stock closed at $34.26, down 48% from its closing high of $66 on March 27.\nThe stock is volatile for a number of reasons. First, as it’s closely tied to Donald Trump, there is a lot of emotion attached to the stock. Part of the reason DJT soared on its first day of trading was no doubt in part due to the excitement among the former president’s supporters. But the hard numbers behind the company play a major role as well.\nTrump Media and Technology Group generated $4.1 million in revenue in 2023 but lost $58.2 million — and those losses are likely to continue. Even the company’s CEO, Devin Nunes, said that for the foreseeable future, the company will continue to operate at a loss, and it’s impossible to predict when or even if the company will ever become profitable. The company’s own auditor said that DJT’s losses raise “substantial concern” about whether it can even continue as a going concern. With these types of financial troubles hanging over the stock, it will likely continue to remain volatile.\nBut that’s not all. Short sellers, or those who profit when a company’s stock falls, have gone after the company in a big way, shorting about 12% of all outstanding DJT shares. That’s a high number for any stock, and it could be contributing to the downward trend in the stock. Selling will likely continue unless the share price makes a dramatic reversal.\nCheck Out: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell\nTrump losing the November election may very well put additional pressure on DJT shares. As the company itself is intimately tied to Trump, losing what may turn out to be his last election could cause investors to walk away from the stock. With no earnings to help push the stock up, it will likely remain in the hands of speculators, making its future unpredictable.\nOne of the reasons it’s hard to get a handle on DJT stock is that there aren’t any Wall Street analysts providing research coverage on it as of yet. This is likely to change before the November election, so you may want to wait to get some more information before you make an investment decision on the stock. In the meantime, the stock will likely trade more on emotion than fundamentals until it can get closer to earning a profit. Something else that analysts will likely factor in when they finally issue their research reports is that companies that go public via a special acquisition company, as DJT did, don’t have the best track records.\nIf Trump Media and Technology Group somehow manages to turn a profit earlier than expected, or if Wall Street analysts start slapping buy ratings on the stock, it could have a significant run. Of course, the opposite is also true. If short sellers continue to bet against the stock, if the company continues to lose money, and/or if Trump loses the November election, the selling may very well continue. But at the present time, deciding whether or not DJT can be a long-term winner is more of a speculation than anything else.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Moves For Building Lasting Wealth: What Smart Americans Are Doing Right\n6 2024 Car Models To Stay Away From in Retirement\n4 Ways to Talk to Your Partner About Debt\n5 Groceries Frugal People Buy in Fall\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: What Happens To Your Investment in Trump Stock If He Loses the 2024 Election?"

Wondering whether you’re in America’s middle class? Per Pew Research Center, the middle class has a household income between $39,693 and $119,080.\nCheck Out: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: Here’s What That Would Mean for the Economy and Your Wallet\nFor You: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nIf you fall in that range, here is what economists and political experts say you can expect if Trump wins the election.\nTrending Now:\nBoomers Have the Wealth--Why Are Thousands Still Homeless?\nSuze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nWhen Trump was president, he passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). If Trump is reelected, Republicans will work to extend the TCJA tax cuts, some of which expire in 2025.\nChuck Warren, host of The Breaking Battlegrounds Politics Podcast, said this could impact what the middle class pays come tax season. “[This extension might] also include further personal and corporate tax rate reductions.”\nWarren said time will tell whether the middle class actually experiences the advantages of the tax cuts. “Although these cuts may increase disposable income for some working-class families, there is controversy over whether all the benefits would be shared equally across the entire middle class.”\nBe Aware: 5 Things You Should Stop Wasting Money on if Kamala Harris Wins in November, According to Experts\nDuring Trump’s term as president, he worked hard to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA). At the end of 2023, Trump was still passionate about this issue, posting on social media, “I don’t want to terminate Obamacare, I want to replace it with much better healthcare.”\nIf he’s reelected and successfully repeals the ACA, Warren said, “This could result in different healthcare policies affecting middle-class households, thereby leading to higher out-of-pocket healthcare expenses if pre-existing condition protections and subsidies are rolled back.”\nThe future of retirement programs is a major issue in this election.\n“Economists point out that Trump may pursue changes affecting benefits received by middle-class retirees, concerning future funding needs,” Warren said.\nDuring his presidency, Trump proposed cuts to Social Security and reductions to provider payments on costs covered by Medicare.\nConversely, on his 2024 campaign trail, Trump and his campaign have said he won’t cut those programs. In a campaign video, he said, “Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security.”\nTrump levied large tariffs against China during his presidency and has said he would double down if elected again. He has suggested imposing a 10% tariff on imports and a 60% tax on Chinese goods.\nLandon Pyle, the VP of sales and marketing at R&S Logistics Inc., said this would hit middle-class consumers hard.\n“Everything from furniture and household appliances to cars and computer parts relies on imports, and U.S. manufacturing is not positioned to meet the consumer demand,” Pyle said. “Instead, importers will likely raise prices to offset the tariffs, ultimately impacting middle-class consumers.”\nWhen Trump was campaigning to be president in 2016, he discussed a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that would work to fix highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools and hospitals in the United States. While there were some successes, the promised plan was criticized by some states and largely seen as a disappointment.\nIf Trump wins and follows through on infrastructure promises, it could mean big job growth, Warren said.\n“Economists argue that if these projects were given priority then they would create many jobs,” he said, “especially benefiting those involved in construction and related areas — with the majority being from middle-class families.”\nIn 2018, Trump’s administration rolled out a five-year strategic plan for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. The goal was to teach necessary technical skills to folks in high-tech workplaces.\nIf we have another Trump presidency, Warren said he could continue to focus on these types of training programs, potentially giving more earning power to Americans.\n“These endeavors might equip the middle class with additional skills and more good-paying jobs, especially in scientific and mechanical areas,” Warren said.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n8 Rare Coins Worth Millions That Are Highly Coveted by Coin Collectors\n3 Ways a Balance Transfer Helps You Manage Debt (And How Much it Could Save You)\n6 Items From Costco You Shouldn't Wait To Buy on Black Friday\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 6 Possible Economic Ups and Downs for the Middle Class If Trump Is Elected"

        "article_content": "The future is, as always, up in the air. But it’s possible that some changes to the automotive industry could take place after the next presidential election. If Donald Trump ends up back in office, some experts think that certain vehicles could fluctuate in value.\nSome of this could be due to direct policy changes — like cutting subsidies for electric vehicles or policies that make foreign-made vehicles more expensive. But other factors, like inflation or interest rates, could also play a role.\nRegardless, here are some cars to consider buying now if you think Trump will win the 2024 election, according to automotive and political experts.\nRead Next: I’m an Investor: I’m Making These Money Moves Immediately If Trump Wins\nCheck Out: 6 Subtly Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\n“If Donald Trump wins the 2024 election, there may be a reduction in subsidies for electric vehicles,” said Kateryna Odarchenko, a political strategist and partner of SIC group USA LLC. “Trump’s previous administration focused on rolling back environmental regulations, and a similar approach could lead to decreased incentives for EVs, potentially lowering their market value.”\nIf this happens, Odarchenko said EV companies — such as Tesla, Rivian and Lucid Motors — could become less attractive next year. If you want to buy an electric vehicle, now might be the best time to do so, since you could still potentially get these incentives.\nExamples of electric vehicles to consider buying now include:\n2024 Tesla Model 3\n2024 Rivian R1S\n2024 Lucid Air\nLearn More: These 10 Used Cars Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle\nOdarchenko said that certain vehicles, specifically internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and hybrids, may become more popular if Trump is re-elected. This also means they’re likely to become more expensive.\n“If subsidies for EVs are reduced, there could be an increased demand for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids,” she said. “Brands that are strong in these categories, such as Ford, General Motors and Toyota, might see a rise in value as they become more cost-competitive compared to EVs.”\nSo, if you’re in the market for one of these types of vehicles, getting one now could be more cost-effective than waiting until after the election.\nPopular ICEs to consider include:\nKira Forte\nVolkswagen Jetta\nHyundai Elantra\nNissan Versa\nAs a note, many of these automobile companies also produce hybrids.\n“I believe that Trump’s emphasis on boosting domestic manufacturing could positively affect American car brands,” said Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing at CFR Classic. “Companies like Ford and General Motors, which have a significant manufacturing presence in the U.S., might see an uptick in value.”\nThe reason for this is that a Trump administration is more likely to implement policies that favor domestic production — and domestic automobile makers. Policies, Giranda noted, might include tax incentives that make purchasing one of these vehicles more attractive.\n“In my opinion, if you’re considering purchasing a vehicle before the election to potentially save money, American brands like Ford and General Motors might be a safer bet,” he said. “These brands could benefit from a favorable policy environment that supports domestic manufacturing and economic growth.”\nPossible examples of these vehicles include:\n2024 Ford Mustang\n2024 Chevrolet Equinox\nIf Trump is elected, and if he ends up introducing policies that cause international goods — and cars — to skyrocket in price, you might also want to consider purchasing an international brand vehicle before the election. Just like with electric vehicles, doing this could potentially mean a lower price tag.\n“We might see some volatility with foreign car brands, especially if trade tensions were to escalate,” said Giranda. “Brands like Toyota, Honda and BMW … could be affected by changes in trade policies or tariffs.”\nGiranda did note that any price increases on imported or internationally-made vehicles could be short term only. It all depends on what actually happens with the election and the coming years.\nBased on that, here are a few of these vehicles to get now to save money later:\n2024 Toyota Corolla\n2024 Honda Accord\n2024 BMW 5 Series\n“There is a good chance that if Trump becomes president, car prices could go up significantly,” said Ben Michael, director of auto at Michael & Associates. “One thing he’s been very vocal about wanting to do is impose significant tariffs on imported goods, and since the U.S. imports not only cars but materials for car building, that could lead to a sharp decrease in what auto-related parts and models we bring into the country. This would reduce supply, which would in turn increase prices on what we do have available here in the U.S.”\nRegardless of who wins the election, do your research before purchasing any vehicle. Make sure it fits into your budget and needs. Even if certain brands do increase in price — or drop in value — after this year, what matters is choosing a vehicle that you’re happy with and that doesn’t cause undue pressure on your wallet.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "date": "2024-11-03T11:11:33.000Z",
        "article_content": "We’re now just days away from the ’24 elections, and what a race it’s been. Polls have been all over the place, and both parties can make legitimate claims to holding the advantage as we approach Tuesday’s vote.\nAmidst the political drama, the stock market has remained robust, with the S&P 500 surging 20% year-to-date. Historically, the index tends to perform well in election years, but this year has been exceptional, making it the most bullish election-year market in decades. A mix of macroeconomic factors, especially expectations of further Fed rate cuts, has fueled strong investor confidence.\nMorgan Stanley’s analysts are embracing this momentum, picking out stocks they believe are primed for gains regardless of the election outcome. They’ve zeroed in on two specific stocks poised for substantial growth in the coming year – including one with a potential upside as high as 670%.\nAs if that weren’t compelling enough, according to the TipRanks database, both stocks are also rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s see what’s driving this optimism among market experts.\nTenaya Therapeutics (TNYA)\nWe’ll start with Tenaya Therapeutics, a research-oriented biopharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and producing new therapeutic drugs for the treatment of heart disease. Tenaya is targeting its approach on the underlying causes of heart disease, including rare genetic disorders. The company’s approach includes gene therapies, cellular regeneration, and precision medicines.\nHeart disease is the world’s leading cause of death among adults, making its treatment an important niche. Tenaya currently has two primary drug candidates under investigation, TN-201 and TN-401, for the treatment of MYBPC3-associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and PKP2-associated arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, respectively.\nThe leading candidate, TN-201, is currently undergoing a Phase 1b human clinical trial. The study is focused on safety and tolerability and will enroll up to 24 adults. Data from the first patient cohort in the study are expected to be released in December, presenting a significant milestone for the stock. Meanwhile, enrollment is ongoing for the second cohort.\nThe second candidate, TN-401, entered its Phase 1 RIDGE-1 trial earlier this year. This global, open-label, dose-escalation study, which will continue patient dosing through Q4 2024, aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of a single intravenous dose of TN-401.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Michael Ulz views TNYA as a compelling investment, with TN-201 as the primary value driver. Ulz notes, “Interim Ph1b MyPEAK-1 data for TN-201 in nHCM are expected in [December] and represent a key catalyst for Tenaya’s lead program. We see a favorable risk/reward on initial data, which could provide early de-risking, followed by more robust data in 2025.”\n“We view favorable trends on cardiac biomarkers and uninterpretable protein expression data as the most likely scenario,” Ulz added. “We believe investors would view the data as positive and suggestive of benefit… Under this scenario we would expect TNYA shares to trade up +100%.”\nTo this end, Ulz rates TNYA shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), while his $15 price target offers a whopping ~670% upside from current levels. (To watch Ulz’s track record, click here)\nThe consensus view here shows that Morgan Stanley’s bullish take is no outlier. TNYA stock has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 7 recent positive analyst reviews. The stock’s $1.94 trading price and $20.20 average target price together suggest an impressive upside of 941% on the 12-month horizon. (See TNYA stock forecast)\nRoyalty Pharma (RPRX)\nThe next Morgan Stanley pick we’ll look at is Royalty Pharma, a company that gives investors an interesting way to put money into the biotech sector. Royalty Pharma operates as a royalty company; that is, it purchases ownership rights in biopharmaceutical products and earns royalties on sales and profits. Royalty Pharma has built up a pipeline of such opportunities, designed to generate and maintain a steady stream of revenues.\nThis royalty strategy has led the company to put together a solid portfolio of assets. Royalty Pharma boasts rights in more than 35 approved products, and backs that up with rights in another 17 drug candidates still in the development stage. Of this total lineup, 15 products are considered ‘blockbusters,’ generating more than $1 billion in annual sales. And for the long term, the company’s portfolio has an average duration of 13 years. In the five-year period from 2018 to 2023, Royalty Pharma deployed an average annual capital of $2 billion, and in calendar year 2023, Royalty Pharma brought in $3 billion in total portfolio receipts.\nIn its last reported quarter (2Q24), Royalty Pharma reported portfolio receipts (revenue) of $608 million, marking a 12% year-over-year increase, though this came in $18 million below consensus. The company raised its 2024 portfolio receipts guidance to a range of $2.7 billion to $2.775 billion, up from a previous forecast of $2.6 to $2.7 billion. Additionally, the company posted an EPS of $0.96, reflecting a 13% increase year-over-year, slightly shy of the consensus estimate of $0.99.\nChecking in with the Morgan Stanley view, we find analyst Terence Flynn taking an upbeat view of the company and its prospects for the long-term.\n“RPRX has one of the highest top line growth rates in our coverage and is trading at a discount. In our view the company’s growth profile and diversified portfolio deserves at least an in-line multiple and hence our Overweight rating. We acknowledge that RPRX must continue to deploy capital towards new deals given patent/royalty expiries in order to sustain HSD growth, but management has a strong historical track record on this front. We see two areas of potential upside to estimates that could meaningfully move the needle – AMGN’s Olpasiran/ NOVN’s Pelacarsen for ACVD and JNJ’s Tremfya for psoriasis/IBD,” Flynn opined.\nFlynn’s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating is backed by a $51 price target, suggesting a potential one-year upside of 88%. (To watch Flynn’s track record, click here)\nMorgan Stanley isn’t alone in this positive outlook. Royalty Pharma enjoys unanimous support, with 5 Buy ratings and a Strong Buy consensus. Currently priced at $27.10, the stock’s average price target of $44.40 implies a ~64% upside in the coming months.

        "article_content": "Hurricane Sandy, the 2016 email scandal, and COVID hitting the White House all occurred in October. Other odd events have happened in October throughout the years too.\nSo, this October could be a strange one.\nUnfortunately, election-year Octobers are often bad for stocks too. In fact, since 1928, election year Octobers have seen the S&P 500 drop 0.3%, on average:\nHere’s something perhaps even weirder…when you split up October performance into halves, one half stands out from the other. Despite Halloween being at the end of October, the spooky times for stocks occur in the first half of the month.\nIn analyzing election-year Octobers since 1988, the first half sees the S&P 500 (using the exchange-traded fund SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as a proxy) drag 2.8% before firming up in the back half. This anomaly also exists with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (using the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF as a proxy) and the small-cap Russell 2000 (using the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) as a proxy). But the Novembers and Decembers that follow are often good:\nIn other words, October dips tee up big late-year rips…especially for small-cap stocks. As the chart above shows, in November and December of election years, the Russell 2000 averages a 7.3% gain.\nThat could play out this year too as recent money flows show a heavy appetite for smaller companies (81% of buys targeting market caps below $50 billion):\nOff-the-run small- and mid-cap stocks have been beaming all year in MAPsignals data. When you dive below the surface, there are all sorts of single stock stories working.\nOne is Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN). The heavy equipment maker has had healthy institutional support alongside favorable forward earnings growth for a while now.\nIt’s no surprise ALSN made MAPsignals’ rare Top 20 list six times this year so far. These sorts of recurring inflows power stocks higher.\nElection mudslinging is well underway. Just don’t let anything spook you out of stocks.\nSee, October surprises date back to the 1800s. Heading into presidential elections, unexpected events routinely surface out of the blue.\nSo, expect an October surprise to jitter markets this year. Strap on the helmet and buy any pre-election dip that typically emerges in the first half of October.\nHistory shows that early October weakness is met with back-end October stabilization. Furthermore, November kicks off bullish season for equities.\nThus, it’s wise to focus on quality stocks the media doesn’t cover (like ALSN). That’s where institutional investors find alpha.\nOf course, finding them is easier with a MAP.

        "date": "2024-06-19T19:00:15.000Z",
        "article_content": "According to experts and recent data, Donald Trump’s potential reelection could reshape the U.S. housing market amid soaring mortgage rates and escalating home prices.\nThe current state of the housing market, characterized by two-decade high borrowing costs and record home prices, is straining affordability for many Americans. With the presidential election approaching, industry specialists are examining how Trump’s policies — ranging from deregulation to tax and trade measures — might influence market dynamics, potentially easing some pressures but also introducing new risks.According to a survey issued Monday by National Mortgage News, while many mortgage professionals lean Republican, the consensus suggests that the next presidential term, regardless of the winner, may not alter the course for lenders and mortgage origination activities.\nDon't Miss:\n​​Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" This high-yield real estate fund, offering an 8% yield, makes earning passive income easier than ever. \nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\"We’re not assuming the election changes anything significantly for the mortgage industry,\" Keefe, Bruyette and Woods managing director Bose George said to National Mortgage News.\nHis sentiment reflects a broader skepticism about the presidential influence over key economic levers, notably interest rates, which are controlled by the Federal Reserve rather than any direct political interventions.However, the Wall Street Journal reported in April that members of the Trump campaign were developing a plan that would see the Fed restructured under Trump (should he win in November), and he would be given authority over interest rate decisions.Such a change would be significant for the former president, who, during his last presidency, attempted to influence the Fed on rate decisions.\nTrending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?Outside of interest rates, nuances in policy under Trump’s potential leadership could foster an environment of lesser regulatory burdens, according to the survey. During his previous term, Trump’s administration was known for rolling back regulations, which some argue could again lead to more business-friendly conditions but also raise concerns about the risks of under-regulated financial activities.Critics point to the potential for relaxed lending standards that could increase market volatility.Regarding housing agency leadership, Trump’s appointments could signal a shift toward less aggressive regulatory oversight. Observers like Bill Killmer, the Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) senior vice president for legislative and political affairs, suggest a Trump administration would likely emulate the less interventionist stances of previous Republican appointees, focusing strictly on statutory mandates without extending into the \"gray areas\" often explored by Democratic appointees.The Department of Justice's ongoing probe into Realtor commissions, which was rekindled during Trump's last year in office, is also seen as likely to wane under a Republican administration.A change in that arena could affect the landscape of real estate transactions and potentially ease some of the pressures on Realtor commissions.\"If you saw a change of administration, going back into a Republican regime, I do think that you would see a less active DOJ in this space,\" KBW's George said in the report. \"So that might change how they move things going forward.\"Further, the government’s control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could shift under a second Trump administration. Trump had previously advocated for ending their government conservatorship, signaling potential renewed efforts in that direction.However, experts, including Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) former director Mark Calabria, warn that achieving full privatization would be a complex and lengthy process.Lastly, tax policy. According to the survey, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed by Trump in 2017, expires in 2025. While President Biden is prepared to let the cuts expire, Trump advocates extending them, arguing that their lapse could damage the economy.Killmer pointed to a need for legislative action to maintain incentives encouraging real estate investment, regardless of the election outcome. Extending the cuts, however, would increase the federal deficit by $4.6 trillion, the survey said, citing data from the Congressional Budget Office.\nKeep Reading:\nThe average millionaire has 7 sources of income.

        "article_content": "This November, millions of Americans voted to bring Donald Trump back to the White House. Many of them made their decision based on the belief that he would strengthen the economy. However, many economists and financial experts have been sounding the alarm that Trump’s policies could do more harm than good — potentially a lot more harm.\nBe Aware: The Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Retirees Should Make Before Inauguration Day\nCheck Out: 5 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money That Actually Work\nAnthony Scaramucci occupies a unique position among these critics. He worked in the Trump 1.0 administration as White House communications director for such a brief tenure that the term “a Scarmucci” entered the cultural lexicon as shorthand for “a short period of time.” He spent the 2024 election season as one of Trump’s fiercest foes, largely due to the damage he believes Trump’s policies could inflict on the economy.\nScaramucci has gone on record predicting the stock market could crash during Trump’s second term. He argued that plans for mass deportations and tariffs could spike the prices of consumer goods. On an MSNBC panel before the election, he warned that Trump’s policies could “explode the deficit” and that stripping the Federal Reserve of its independence could lead to “a massacre of the local currency.”\nThat sounds dire. But wringing your hands isn’t as helpful as planning ahead. Best-case scenario, Scaramucci is wrong, and you’ve adopted some positive financial habits. If he’s right — at least you’ll be ready.\nTrending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nYou know what they say about eggs and baskets. Just as you don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket, no matter how big and beautiful it may seem, you don’t want to put all your resources in a single investment. To mitigate risk, especially when it comes to your retirement savings, it’s wise to spread out your savings across individual stocks, stock mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nConsider getting even more creative with your investments. For instance, precious metals can provide protection against market volatility. Other options include real estate, bonds, cash value life insurance, annuities, and even alternative holdings, such as oil and gas.\nIf you sense bad times on the financial horizon, having a diversified portfolio gives you the freedom to adjust. You can allocate funds to investments that seem more secure, even if only temporarily. That way, even if the worst happens, you’ll still have a safety net.\nLearn More: 3 Major Retailers Who Will Raise Prices Immediately Under Trump — Tariffs Play Key Role\nWhen difficult periods arise, it’s tempting to stick your head in the sand. Hearing about the latest downturn and economic panic can be overwhelming. But fear shouldn’t drive your financial decisions.\nThe best way to protect your investments is by being clear-eyed about what you own and why you own it. Research every stock in your portfolio and assess its value to you. When alarming headlines hit, you can resist the urge to make hasty decisions. Instead, you’ll know whether to hold onto or let go of specific assets.\nRegularly reviewing your portfolio and having level-headed conversations with a trusted financial advisor can keep your decision-making grounded. This approach helps you avoid rash and potentially damaging financial decisions.\nClearing your debt, especially high-interest debt like credit card balances, is always a smart move. It becomes even more critical during economic downturns that often follow market crashes. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by debt, it might be time to liquidate certain holdings to pay it down.\nReducing your debt before a bear market comes lumbering out of the financial woods puts you in a stronger position to weather challenging times — and to rebound once the bull market charges back into the picture.\nAccording to Anthony Scaramucci, a second Trump presidency could bring significant economic challenges, including a potential market crash.

        "article_content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nDespite the chatter about the risks surrounding Americans' trip to the polls on Tuesday, election days aren't historically that bad for the stock market.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose on 8 of the 10 election days the stock market has been open since 1980. If we include both the day of and the day after the election combined, the index has been a bit more fussy, falling half of the time.\nA similar story has played out for the month. The S&P 500 has fallen in 5 of the past 10 election Novembers.\nBut zoom out, and the story improves.\nThe S&P 500 has been up an average of 10.68% in the year following elections dating back to 1960. That's right in line with the standard average return for the S&P 500 over time. It's one of many signs that while the election could very well bring some turbulence to markets over the next few days, particularly if there isn't a clear winner, it rarely halts the long-term trend.\n\"We remain mindful that while elections usually spark short-term repricings, the S&P 500 tends to post gains in all balance-of-power scenarios,\" RBC Capital Markets' Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Sunday.\nEssentially, elections are no different than other risks to the market, like tensions in the Middle East, natural disasters, or worker strikes. The key question remains what any risk could mean for future company earnings.\nAnd for elections, that means potential policies that could alter the corporate operating environment. Typically that means a split-party government, where fewer sweeping changes are passed, is the ideal backdrop for stocks.\n\"Checks and balances as a result of differences of opinion at the Congressional level (sometimes dramatically termed 'gridlock') often have served in the past ... to protect what investors care most about — a healthy economy for consumers and for revenue and profit growth for business,\" Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus wrote in a note to clients on Monday morning.\nAnalyzing the past few presidential cycles furthers this point. Research from Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner shows the S&P 500 grew at an annualized rate of 13% from the day President Barack Obama was elected to the night Donald Trump was elected.\nFrom the day of the Trump win to when Joe Biden won in 2020, the index grew at an annualized rate of 14%.\nSince Biden was elected, the index has averaged a 16% annual return. All three returns are well within the normal range.\nInformation Technology (XLK) was either the top- or second-best-performing sector in the S&P 500 through all three regimes. Lerner reasoned this was \"likely because that's where the earnings growth has been.\"\nIn simple terms, who has been in the White House has done little to weigh on the tech bull market of the past 15 years. And no matter what happens Tuesday night, it's not clear that long-term trend is going to end anytime soon.\nAs Baird market strategist Michael Antonelli told Yahoo Finance, the real driver behind the stock market isn't going to change no matter what happens on Tuesday.\n\"The reason the stock market goes up over time [is] that the people that work at the companies go to work, make products and services, and shareholders get to benefit from that,\" Antonelli said. \"No matter what happens, no matter who wins, your neighbors are going to work and they are going to work.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "A lot happens in any given year, but especially in presidential election years. In 2024, inflation came down, Donald Trump won office for a second time (and the market reacted) and some other major economic changes occurred.\nHeading into 2025, it helps to know what’s happened in 2024. While these major changes aren’t necessarily signs of what’s to come, they certainly can be.\nHere are five big things that happened to the economy in 2024.\nCheck Out: The Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Retirees Should Make Before Inauguration Day\nRead Next: Renting vs. Owning a Home: Which Will Be Cheaper in 2025?\nInvestors and individuals alike have been worried about inflation, especially in recent years. In June 2022, inflation reached 9.1%, according to the BLS. A year later, it was around 3%.\nBy September of 2024, it’d fallen to 2.4%. Considering the target inflation rate is between 2% and 3%, this is surprisingly good news for U.S. consumers.\nLearn More: The Salary Needed To Afford America’s 50 Biggest Cities\nWhat happened on Nov. 5, 2024, can’t be overlooked either. After all, it was a pivotal day in American history — and it had quite an impact on markets, at least in the short term.\nIn reaction to Trump’s win, the S&P 500’s earnings grew by 13% over the year. On election day, earnings were at $5,783. Less than a week later, they were at $6,001 and have been steadily increasing since.\nMeanwhile, U.S. Treasury securities (10-year constant maturity) also went up. On Nov. 4, it was at 4.31. The day after the election, it was at 4.42.\nBitcoin has also seen a significant increase. On Nov. 4, it was at $69,122. The day after the election, it’d risen to $74,446 and has continued to rise ever since. This could be for any number of reasons, one of which could be that the cryptocurrency industry is currently anticipating deregulation under the Trump administration.\nNot all major market changes were a direct result of the presidential election, though that’s certainly had an impact on many areas of the economy.\nEarnings for the largest U.S. companies rose by 5.8% over the past 12 months. Wall Street, by comparison, only expected a 3.5% increase. Many industries have continued to outperform their previously anticipated rates but tech in particular has thrived, accounting for 30% of the total S&P 500 index’s earnings growth.\nNotably, commodities like gold (up 4.2%) and oil (up 4%) also rose higher than ever these past few months. Other areas that have seen significant increases this year include multiples (11% expansion), U.S. large cap equities (25% growth), high-yield bonds (8% increase), Bitcoin (12% increase) and private credit (8% growth).\nUnfortunately, it’s not all been good news. In 2024, many major companies saw an increase in mass layoffs.\nAccording to R&D World, 526 major companies across different sectors were impacted by these layoffs. The combined number of layoffs numbers nearly 150,000.\nBreaking this down further, Intel laid off 15,000 people, Tesla laid off 14,000, Dell laid off 12,500 and Cisco laid off 9,900. Even Amazon was affected, having cut its staff by 9,000. Many of these companies have incorporated AI into their business model, which may have had an impact on these increased layoffs.\nWhat’s worth noting is the overall national unemployment rate. U.S. Bureau of Statistics data shows that it was at 14.8% in April 2020 (during the height of the pandemic). By midway through 2022, it’d fallen to 3.7%. It’s risen somewhat since then to 4.2%.\nThe federal funds rate plays a key role in long-term financing interest rates — including mortgages. Generally, a higher rate means lenders will set higher interest rates as well. This in turn leads to increased financing costs and greater overall interest payments.\nAs of November 2024, the federal funds rate is 4.58%. For most of 2024, it was 5.33%. This overall decrease could be a good sign for those seeking a mortgage or other forms of financing.\nThe typical rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.6% as of Dec. 12, 2024. It’s fallen by 0.35% year-over-year. For 15-year fixed-rate mortgage loans, the average rate is 5.84%, a 0.54% one-year decrease.\nAlthough interest rates have gone down slightly, housing prices have not. As per Zillow data, the average U.S. home value is up 2.5% on the year at $357,469. The median existing home sales price is $407,200. A year ago, it was $391,600. During this time, existing home sales also increased by 3.4%.\nBetween the presidential election and ongoing changes in the U.S. economy, there’s also the potential for significant future changes going forward into 2025.\nAccording to JPMorgan, “The new administration is likely to bring significant change that could further support the recovery in deal-making and capital market liquidity. That could include replacing U.S. government agency leadership with personnel less inclined toward heavy regulation.”\nHowever, only time will tell.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nCostco, Walmart and Other Stores With Perks Retirees Need To Be Taking Advantage Of\n8 Common Mistakes Retirees Make With Their Social Security Checks\nThe Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Retirees Should Make Before Inauguration Day\n3 Things Retirees Should Sell To Build Their Retirement Savings\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 2024 Economy Review: 6 Big Things That Happened"

        "date": "2024-01-17T03:44:03.000Z",
        "article_content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has experienced remarkable bullish momentum, rising by an impressive 177% in the past year. Despite undergoing such a tremendous rally, I expect sustained positive sentiment, especially with 2024 being an election year. With an anticipated uptick in ad spending this year, Meta, a giant in the advertising space, stands to reap significant benefits. Coupled with my view that shares appear reasonably valued, my outlook on META remains bullish.\nWith Meta surging by more than 174% over the past year, the stock is undeniably enjoying unstoppable momentum. In my view, several factors are powering this momentum, but the benefits from the 2024 elections have not been priced in yet, leaving plenty of room for upside.\nIn particular, I would attribute the ongoing stock price rally to a mix of FOMO and improving margins following last year’s cost-cutting initiatives. However, the stock seems cheap relative to Meta’s future earnings growth estimates. But let’s look at one thing at a time.\nLooking back to October 2022, only a year and a half ago, the sentiment surrounding Meta stock was quite different. At the time, shares dipped below $90 as the company grappled with perceived instability. Mark Zuckerberg was then attempting to justify Meta’s Reality Labs segment, incurring over $10 billion in annual losses, as a reasonable investment. The company’s attention had shifted entirely to the elusive “Metaverse.” And yet, the Metaverse demos at the time looked worse than Wii Sports released in 2006.\nInvestors, myself included, disapproved of this direction. We had a robust platform of lucrative apps, and instead of focusing on monetization, cost efficiency, and returning capital to shareholders, Zuckerberg redirected the ship toward the unknown. Fortunately, Meta’s management swiftly responded to investors’ concerns, gradually becoming quieter on the Metaverse and starting to focus on implementing cost-cutting measures, including a 13% reduction in the workforce in late 2022.\nThis caused a rapid shift from an ultra-bearish sentiment to an ultra-bullish one, leading to Meta’s swift rally. Such a sudden shift in sentiment likely left many investors behind. Thus, I believe the ongoing momentum continues to be propelled by FOMO.\nBut while some may argue that this FOMO may have led to the stock being overvalued, I think otherwise. In fact, shares remain attractively priced considering Meta’s future growth estimates – especially in the face of upcoming election-related spending. Let’s take a deeper look.\nThe impending U.S. elections should serve as a substantial tailwind for the advertising industry, with industry giants like Meta poised to capitalize significantly. To provide context, in the 2019-2020 election cycle, total political advertising spending reached a staggering $8.5 billion across all mediums, with political digital advertising witnessing a remarkable 4.6x increase from 2018 to 2020.\nResearch stemming from the previous election cycle underscores Facebook’s 12-fold cost-effectiveness compared to TV in less efficient geographical zones. Also, a February 2021 Wesleyan study revealed that over 10 times as many state legislative candidates opted to advertise on Facebook than on television, primarily attributing this choice to the cost-advantaged tradeoff.\nWith politicians increasingly convinced of the effectiveness of digital ad spend, the current election cycle is poised to lead to a substantial surge in political ad spending.\nReuters reports a projected 30% increase in political ad spending in the U.S. this year compared to the last presidential election in 2020, primarily driven by higher expenditures on digital platforms. While TV remains the dominant recipient of ad spending, digital platforms are expected to see the most significant growth in political ads, with revenues forecasted to surge by 156% from 2020 to $3.46 billion in 2024.\nWall Street analysts seem to be catching up to this reality. Last year, the market anticipated Meta to achieve revenues of approximately $137 billion in Fiscal 2024. This figure has since risen to nearly $151 billion, and given the ongoing trajectory of earnings estimate revisions, there is a strong likelihood that this figure will continue to ascend.\nIn the interim, consensus estimates suggest that Meta will post EPS of $17.43 next year. Notably, Wall Street estimates have historically been conservative, with Meta often exceeding expectations by a wide margin. Even if we adopt Wall Street’s estimate, though, Meta’s current valuation stands at a modest 21 times next year’s EPS.\nI believe that this forward P/E is cheap, given the company’s substantial market dominance, consistent double-digit growth, and management’s strategic focus on bolstering profits. Consequently, in spite of Meta’s considerable rally in recent quarters, the combination of relatively subdued forward estimates and a soft valuation should continue to support the ongoing positive momentum.\nRegarding Wall Street’s sentiment on the stock, Meta Platforms retains a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 36 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $397.31, the average META stock price target suggests 8.1% upside potential.\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell META stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Brad Erickson from RBC Capital, with an average return of 58.54% per rating and a 76% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\nMeta Platforms’ crazy surge in the past year reflects its invincible momentum driven by factors like FOMO and improving margins. However, as the 2024 election year approaches, the anticipated uptick in political ad spending positions Meta for further gains.\nReflecting on Meta’s transformative journey from a Metaverse-centric focus to a profit-driven strategy, the current valuation also appears attractive. With a notable increase in political ad spending that only gradually appears priced in by Wall Street estimates, Meta’s ongoing positive momentum seems poised for sustained growth.\nDisclosure"

        "article_content": "Bitcoin is likely to top $100,000 after the U.S. election, if history is any guide.\nBTC is undervalued compared with previous cycles, measuring from either the cycle low or since the halving.\nCrypto markets are likely to remain volatile as we await the result of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election. Over the short term, this will probably dictate crypto’s price movements. However, once the situation settles down, bitcoin {{BTC}} is likely to experience a significant rally if the pattern from previous votes is repeated.\nBitcoin, created in 2009, is about to experience its fourth U.S. election. Data from the three previous times shows the largest cryptocurrency has always rallied subsequently and never dropped back to its election-day price. If this trend reoccurs, the BTC price should peak in about a year's time.\nRead More: Here's Why Today's U.S. Election Matters for Crypto\n2012\nIn the 2012 U.S. election, which also took place on Nov. 5, bitcoin was hovering around $11. The top of the cycle occurred in November 2013, which saw the price rocket by almost 12,000%, with bitcoin climbing to over $1,100.\n2016\nFast-forward four years. During the first week of November, the price of bitcoin was approximately $700. It peaked in December 2017 at around $18,000, appreciating about 3,600%.\n2020\nAfter the most recent vote, the November 2020 election that coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic, bitcoin rallied 478% to a market top of around $69,000 a year later. It hit a record high over $73,000 in March 2024.\nAfter each event, with the price of bitcoin so much higher than four years before, the size of the jump has dropped, providing diminishing returns. The percentage decrease between the first and second number is 70%. Between the second and third it's 87%. If we extend the trend and assume that this time the decrease will be around 90%, that implies a post-election rally of about 47.8%. That would take bitcoin to about $103,500 in fourth-quarter 2025.\nKeep in mind that bitcoin is currently undervalued compared with previous cycles. That's the case whether we measure it from the cycle low, which took place during the collapse of FTX in November 2022, as the graph below shows, or from April's mining-reward halving.\nIn fact, this is the worst-performing cycle from the halving, with bitcoin just 7% higher than when the 50% cut kicked in, which adds to further evidence of the diminishing returns theory."

        "article_content": "A new forecast from Standard Chartered says that the price of bitcoin could spike to a fresh all-time high next month, and that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could hit $100,000 by the time of the 2024 presidential election in November.\nAt the time of writing, bitcoin is hovering around $62,000, according to data from CoinGecko.\nHowever, that’s likely to change, according to the multinational bank. “A fresh all-time for bitcoin in August is likely, then $100,000 by U.S. election day,” said Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered Bank's head of forex and digital assets research.\nLast month, Kendrick forecast that bitcoin’s price at the end of the year would reach $150,000. By 2025, he expects that bitcoin’s price may climb to $200,000.\n\"Notably, a $150,000 price by end-2024 would see bitcoin join the $3 trillion club in terms of market cap, following [Nvidia’s] $3 trillion market cap,” Kendrick said.\nStandard Chartered’s Kendrick also weighed in on how the U.S. presidential contest might impact bitcoin prices, predicting that President Joe Biden’s decision to continue his presidential candidacy would present \"a fantastic buying opportunity” for bitcoin investors.\nHowever, if Biden drops out, the price of bitcoin could drop to $50,000, he said. Kendrick also pointed out that “bitcoin prices will stay soft” if President Joe Biden is supplanted by alternative candidates like former First Lady Michelle Obama.\nGiven former president Donald Trump’s embrace of bitcoin, Kendrick added that \"both regulation and mining would be looked at more favorably under Trump.”\nTrump began accepting campaign donations in crypto in May in a bid to assemble a so-called \"crypto army,\" assailing the Biden administration's more tepid stance toward digital assets."

Per usual, the move seems more obvious than in hindsight than it was in real-time. For example, multiple geopolitical conflicts are occurring in Europe and the Middle East, interest rates remain at elevated levels, and many investors are concerned about valuations and wonder how much fuel the artificial intelligence buildout has left in the tank. That said, there are several reasons to remain bullish equities into year-end, including:\nHistorical seasonality trends have been a fantastic guide for investors. Though trading volumes tend to dip into the Thanksgiving holiday, stocks historically tend to grind higher into the end of November. Meanwhile, Ryan Detrick of Carson Research points out that, “No month is more likely to be higher than December in an election year.” Using data going back to 1950, the month of December is higher 83% of the time during presidential election years.\nA common bearish argument amongst Wall Street investors has been that there is a lack of broad participation, or breadth, in the market.

        "article_content": "At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Alex Soros, son of billionaire George Soros and chairman of the Open Society Foundations, made some striking remarks about former President Donald Trump’s influence on the Republican Party and his potential paths forward.\nAccording to Soros, Trump’s control over the Republican Party is so strong that his political presence is inescapable, suggesting that Trump’s future could either lead to incarceration because of his legal challenges or a return to power. Soros speculated that Trump could remain the Republican candidate for elections well into the future, underscoring the cyclical nature of his political influence​​​​​​.\nDon't Miss:\nCheddar was acquired for $200 million yielding a return of 370.37% for its investors. This startup aims to replicate and potentially surpass this success.\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?\nSoros said the only way to escape Trump is that he \"either winds up in prison or he winds up in power.\" Soros already commented on the sentiment of the 2024 election, noting Davos had already declared Trump would be reelected.\nThis comes at a time when Trump is leading most polls. Trump won the 2016 election despite months of trailing in the polls to former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump was predicted to lose by nearly every poll conducted going into the election.\nTrump lost the 2020 election as all but two polls conducted showed President Joe Biden as a clear winner.\nTrending: Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\nSoros’s comments reflect on Trump’s unique position in American politics, where despite facing numerous legal challenges — including four separate criminal cases with a total of 91 felony counts — his popularity in the national polls remains undiminished. This phenomenon has led to discussions about Trump’s potential to win the 2024 election, even as many business and political leaders at Davos expressed their belief that Trump could outperform Biden​​.\nSoros critiqued Trump’s impact on American democracy, suggesting that Trump’s presidency challenged the country’s foundational checks and balances system. This critique aligns with Soros’s broader observations about the current political cycle, which he describes as dominated by Trump’s enduring influence​​.\nSoros's statements highlight the polarized nature of American political discourse and the ongoing debates about democracy’s resilience in the face of such division.

Smaller tokens like Ether and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin also struggled for traction.\nTrump’s preference for crypto friendly regulations and support for the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve lifted digital assets. But scaled back expectations for interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have cooled the speculative frenzy.\nMore clarity on the US crypto regime is likely to emerge after Trump assumes power on Jan. 20. The Republican’s stance contrasts with President Joe Biden’s administration, which cracked down on the scandal-prone sector.\nChris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, said “the momentum has come out of the post-election move” in Bitcoin, partly due to outflows from exchange-traded funds for the token. The group of a dozen ETFs in the US have seen a net outflow of nearly $1.8 billion since Dec. 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nMeanwhile, software maker turned Bitcoin accumulator MicroStrategy Inc. has been on a buying spree in the past few weeks. Traders are waiting to see if the company — which owns more than $40 billion of the digital asset — will continue a pattern of announcing Bitcoin purchases on Mondays.\nThe original cryptocurrency has climbed roughly 120% this year, outstripping traditional investments such as global stocks and gold.

October sales rose 0.4% month on month, versus 0.3% expected, including a revision higher for September's reading to 0.8% from 0.4%.\nWall Street is back to puzzling over the Fed's path next year, a question already muddied by this week's inflation prints. As of Friday morning, traders are pricing in 62% odds of a rate cut at its December policy meeting, compared with 72% the day before, per CME FedWatch tool. Bets on a January easing stand at 74%, versus the previous 81%.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nAt the same time, investors kept a watchful eye on Trump's preparations for power, after vaccine stocks fell amid reports Robert F. Kennedy Jr will be named top health official. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon made it clear Thursday he won’t be joining the new president's team.\nUS stocks sank on Friday, recording steep weekly losses as investors absorbed Chair Jerome Powell's signal that the Federal Reserve won't hurry to make interest rate cuts.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led declines, falling 2.2%.\nPowell's hawkish comments are dragging the markets lower after initial optimism for President-elect Donald Trump's agenda begins to wear off.\nThe S&P lost more than 2% for the week. The Dow shed 1.2%, and the Nasdaq logged a weekly loss of 3.2%\nEarnings season is winding down but quarterly results from Nvidia scheduled for next week headline an otherwise sparse economic calendar.\nThe company has been at the heart of the explosive growth of AI. Its shares have risen nearly 200% so far this year, making the chip designer the most valuable publicly traded company by market cap. Nvidia's earnings will provide another status update on the strength of the industry and will cap a mixed season for the Magnificent Seven stocks.\nThe following week will also likely bring another flurry of Trump nomination announcements as the president-elect taps business leaders, political figures, and controversial names to fill his proposed cabinet. Two leading contenders for Treasury secretary — Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management investing chief — have been making a case directly to Trump as well as through public signals to perhaps sway markets to their side.\nInvestors will also get a fresh reading on consumer sentiment, existing home sales, and housing starts.\nYahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:\nPresident-elect Trump's reported plans to get rid of the tax credit for electric vehicles is meeting industry pushback.\nOn Friday a group representing major electric vehicle and battery manufacturers urged him to reverse course, Reuters reported, pointing to the negative economic impact that would would come by eliminating the credits.\nThe current $7,500 subsidy has been a key incentive driving consumer adoption of EVs in the US, and its removal could make these vehicles less affordable.\nMeanwhile, Tesla shares rose more than 2% Friday as investors and analysts took the news as an advantage for the EV maker, whose CEO is allied with Trump. \"While this is a clear negative for the EV industry at first look and would particularly hurt GM, Ford, Stellantis, and Rivian ... on the flip side we view this as a net bullish move for Tesla and Musk over time.\" wrote Wedbush analysts in a note on Thursday.\n\"Tesla has a scale and scope that is unmatched and while losing the EV tax credit could also hurt some demand on the margins in the US, this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit,\" they wrote.\nSeveral CEOs aren't adopting an alarmist posture even as economists have warned that if Trump follows through with his promises for stiff new tariffs the new president will unleash economic disruption.\nThat's because executives have adapted their businesses for potential geopolitical turmoil, Bloomberg reports, offering some defense against volatility that might be prompted by Trump's protectionist agenda.\nSome executives have expressed confidence in their operations because of changes they've made in anticipation of new tariffs, and through supply chain shifts honed during the COVID disruptions. They also highlight that what Trump has said on the campaign trail may not directly translate to new policy.\n“There is some natural cover-up against possible tariffs or whatever, but let’s not speculate whether there are tariffs. It might also only be that this is a verbal issue,” said BMW CEO Oliver Zipse during an earnings call. Companies in recent years have also shifted some manufacturing away from China or already have operations domestically.\n“In the United States, I would think we almost have a perfect setup for the time to come,\" Zipse said.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday:\nPalantir (PLTR): Shares of the the software platform Palantir (PLTR) rose more than 8% Friday after the company announced that it would list on the Nasdaq later this month and expects to be eligible to join the Nasdaq 100 index.\nPfizer (PFE): The pharmaceutical company fell 4%, continuing a slide among vaccine makers, including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX), after President-elect Trump named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy is an outspoken skeptic of vaccines.\nPool Corp. (POOL): Shares of the pool equipment distributor of rose nearly 2% Friday afternoon following news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) recently disclosed a stake in the company. The 1% stake in Pool Corp., valued at $152 million, appeared to serve as a green light for other investors who track Berkshire's portfolio and investment decisions.\nApplied Materials (AMAT): The maker of chip-manufacturing equipment tumbled more than 8% Friday following an earnings report that missed expectations for first-quarter sales and that came with a disappointing sales outlook, suggesting a slowdown in customer orders. Other chip and tech stocks have sunk in tandem, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO).\nAll three major gauges were on track to record losses for the week as investors reacted to fresh signals from the Federal Reserve that interest rate cuts won't be fast-tracked.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led declines, falling nearly 2.3%.\nFed Chair Powell's recent hawkish comments have put the brakes on the market, halting what had been optimism over what a second Trump presidency would mean for Wall Street.\nThe S&P is on track to shed 2.2% for the week. The Dow is poised to lose 1.5% , while the Nasdaq is set to give up more than 3%.\nShares of the the software platform Palantir (PLTR) rose more than 9% Friday after the company announced that it would list on the Nasdaq later this month and expects to be eligible to join the Nasdaq 100 index.\nInvestors pounced on the move, pushing the stock to a record high and setting Palantir up to be the best-performing S&P stock so far this year. Shares have climbed nearly 280% year to date, surpassing AI darling Nvidia's gains of almost 190%.\nThe inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index would give the stock a higher profile and prompt investors who use the gauge as a benchmark to purchase Palantir shares to reflect the index.\nPalantir said it would switch its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange and begin trading on Nasdaq on Nov. 26, Reuters reported.\nPrior to the announcement, Palantir gained momentum in recent months as part of the AI play and defense trade.\nVaccine and other healthcare stocks fell Friday after President-elect Donald Trump said Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is his pick to lead the US Health and Human Services Department (HHS). But some analysts think the reaction may overstate the changes RFK might bring to the agency, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani.\n\"Admittedly, it is difficult to evaluate the exact impact this appointment could have on the industry until we have more information on specific policy proposals and priorities of the incoming administration on healthcare and the drug industry,\" wrote JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott in a note to clients Friday.\nRFK Jr., a vocal skeptic of the drug approval process, will be able to select leaders of all the health departments under HHS, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\"We are not surprised the sector has been under pressure on the potential for RFK Jr. having oversight of the various agencies within HHS ... given his previous stated views on the industry,\" Schott wrote.\nBut, like other aspects of future Trump administration policy, it's unclear how much of the political rhetoric will turn into actual policy.\nRead more about the healthcare sector's reaction to RFK Jr. here\nOctober retail sales grew from the prior month, reflecting continued resilience in the American consumer.\nRetail sales rose 0.4% in October, reports Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer.\nEconomists had expected a 0.3% spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in September were revised up to a 0.8% increase from a prior reading that showed a 0.4% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Auto sales drove a majority of the gains in October's reading, with sales in the sector rising 1.6%.\nThe report comes as investors continue to closely monitor the health of the US economy and the Federal Reserve's dials back its restrictive interest rate policy. To date, economic data has largely been better than expected, a welcome sign for investors as markets shift to accept the Fed may not slash interest rates as quickly as initially hoped.\nIn prepared remarks on Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, “The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates.\"\nPowell added, \"The strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the ability to approach our decisions carefully.”\nRead more about the health of the US consumer here.\nUS stocks fell on Friday, on track for weekly losses, as investors absorbed Fed Chair Jerome Powell's signal that the Federal Reserve won't hurry to make interest rate cuts.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped over 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slid roughly 0.4%.

The moves follow sharp declines in shares of the stocks on Thursday, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported.\nWith the premarket tumble, Novavax is now down more than 40% for the month.

The U.S. president earns $400,000 a year, which might be a pay cut for some of these candidates, yet a huge pay bump for others.\nSee: Here’s How Much Every Living US President Is Worth: Where Does Biden Rank?Know: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nLet’s explore the net worth of those who seem to be staying the course.\nNet Worth: $10 Million\nPresident Joe Biden has said he has every intention of running for reelection in 2024. Biden served as former President Barack Obama’s vice president from 2009-2017. Before that, he served as a Delaware senator from 1973 until he took office as VP.\nSince he first took office, his net worth received a boost of $2 million, putting him in the eight-figure range. His income soared in the past few years largely due to his salary as president, rising real estate values, rising interest rates on Biden’s investments, and a bullish stock market. Last year, the president and first lady Jill Biden earned a cumulative $620,000, according to their 2023 tax returns. The president earned a salary of $400,000, while Jill Biden earned $86,000 as a professor at Northern Virginia Community College. Jill Biden also earned $4,000 in book royalties. Together, the couple took in $55,000 in Social Security, $35,000 from pensions and annuities, and $39,000 in interest.\nMost of the Biden’s wealth sits in real estate, with two properties in Delaware worth $4.5 million and $2.5 million.\nDiscover: Grant Cardone Asks How Politicians Making $100K Suddenly Become MultimillionairesLearn: How Much Is Vice President Kamala Harris Worth?\nSponsored: Credit card debt keeping you up at night? Find out if you can reduce your debt with these 3 steps\nNet worth: $6.4 billion\nFormer president Donald Trump’s net worth has been on a roller coaster ride since his presidency in 2016. Forbes quoted his net worth at $6.4 billion as of March 2024, which is an increase of nearly $4 billion since he left office.\nTrump Media & Technology Group, the parent company for Truth Social, the social media platform he launched in 2022, is worth $4.6 billion. The company went public following a merger with Digital World Acquisition Group, a publicly traded shell company, AP News announced in March. Trump owns 79 million shares.\nMost of the rest of Trump’s fortune is in real estate, with holdings totaling $1.1 billion, including condos, hotels, commercial real estate buildings, single-family homes, and residential lots across the U.S.  He also owns profitable clubs and resorts across the world, worth an estimated $810 million according to Forbes.\nHe has pensions worth $2 million, $15 million in private aircraft, and $3 million in cryptocurrency.\nMore: How Big Is Senator Lindsey Graham’s Social Security Check?\nNet Worth: $2.5 million\nBest known as the author of the spiritual self-help book “A Return to Love,” Marianne Williamson may be a long-shot in the presidential race as a Democrat going up against Biden in the primary. But she has a highly successful career as the author of 15 books, including three number one New York Times bestsellers.\nHer work as an author and speaker brought in $7.5 million between 2013 and 2017, according to Forbes. However, Williamson also likes to spend money on clothes and trips. Her tax returns showed write-offs of $41,000 in clothing and $276,000 in travel over five years.\nEven so, her investments are doing well, with $841,000 in mutual funds and shares of stocks like Alphabet, Apple, and The Home Depot, according to Forbes. She also has cash holdings of roughly $250,000.\nFind Out: 25 Richest US Politicians\nNet Worth: $15 million\nAs a member of the famous Kennedy family, you might think Robert Kennedy Jr.’s net worth would number in the billions. The Kennedy family, in total, had a net worth of roughly $1.2 billion in 2015 — and has likely increased since then with the rise in real estate prices and the stock market.\nBut, as one of Bobby Kennedy’s 11 children, RFK Jr. only gets a small portion of that pie. He holds at least $4 million in assets through Kennedy trusts, roughly half a million in investments through the Kennedy family office, Park Financial Holdings, and millions in commercial real estate.\nRecords show that Kennedy also earned more than $5 million between 2022 and 2023 through his law firm, Kennedy & Madonna, and another $1.5 million as a consultant for the Wisner Baum law firm. He also received more than half a million in salary and bonuses for his work with the non-profit Children’s Health Defense.\nHis wife, Cheryl Hines, is wealthy in her own right, earning more than $1 million between 2022 and 2023 as an actress. She has between $600,000 and $1.7 million in retirement accounts that include stocks and bond index funds.\nConsider: How Big Is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Social Security Check?\nNet Worth: $50,000\nCornel West, known as a teacher, author, actor, public speaker and musician, earned more than $15 million over the past 30 years. Yet, he seems to have nothing to show for it, telling Forbes, “I live paycheck to paycheck.”\nThe 70-year-old presidential hopeful, running as an independent, has roughly $483,000 in tax liens for unpaid tax debt. He earned money as a public speaker and author, but, as an independent contractor, did not have any taxes withheld.\nCombined with a lavish lifestyle that included multiple apartments, alleged affairs with many women, and luxury cars, West squandered his earnings. He also had to pay child support following a divorce and was homeless briefly in the 1970s. It would seem he still hasn’t learned money management skills.\nHis entire fortune now rests in a retirement account with roughly $280,000 and a home in Princeton, but these assets don’t cover his debts.\nBrooke Barley contributed to a previous version of this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nMake Yourself Money Smart: 20 ChatGPT Prompts To Increase Your Wealth\n8 Home Items To Avoid Buying at Dollar Tree This Spring\n16 Best Places To Retire in the US That Feel Like Europe\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Rich Are Biden, Trump and These Other Potential 2024 Presidential Candidates?"

        "title": "Polymarket says one French whale is responsible for the lion’s share of bets on a Trump win, to the tune of $28 million worth of crypto",
        "date": "2024-10-24T16:10:53.000Z",
        "article_content": "In the final few weeks of the presidential race, some polls and prediction markets are indicating we could have Donald Trump back in office come January 2025. For the first time since August, the former president overtook Vice President Kamala Harris in The Economist’s statistical model of America’s presidential election, and some other news outlets and political forecasters are predicting the same outcome.\nPrediction markets like Polymarket and PredictIt also show Trump winning the election, but by a much steeper margin than some of the polls. As of Wednesday, Polymarket users have indicated Trump has nearly a 64% chance of winning the election, with Harris trailing at just 36%. PredictIt shows Trump in the lead with a 59% chance and Harris at 43%.\nAlex Marinier, a venture capitalist who was one of the first to invest in Polymarket’s seed round in 2020, told Fortune it’s entirely possible that “some large whale is placing large bets that move the market.”\n“They're either super convinced that Trump would win, or explicitly to influence the market optics in favor of their candidate in an effort to help his odds of being elected,” Marinier said. “However, if the market believes that this whale bettor is, in fact, too optimistic on their candidate, then market forces should bring the market odds back to ‘correct’ market levels.”\nAnd that appears to be exactly what's happening. Starting earlier this month, four Polymarket accounts started pouring millions of dollars' worth of bets that Trump would win the election. And Polymarket just told the New York Times' Dealbook that all four accounts—Polymarket users Fredi9999, Theo4, PrincessCaro, and Michie, which bet a collective $28 million that Trump would win the 2024 presidential election—are all owned by one French national with \"extensive trading experience.\"\nPolymarket said it made contact with the trader and found no evidence of market manipulation, saying the trader was “taking a directional position based on personal views of the election.” The site added the French trader agreed “not to open further accounts without notice.”\nWhat's notable about Polymarket is that it’s a cryptocurrency-based prediction market—and Americans aren’t even allowed to trade on the website. As a result, Polymarket conducts checks to verify that major users on the platform are based outside of the U.S., a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. \nThis could be a key element in cracking the code on why Trump is seemingly pulling so far ahead of Harris, especially since only a handful of Polymarket users appear to be swaying the election odds. \nAnother Polymarket user, zxgngl, has been on a buying spree in recent days, betting more than $5 million worth of crypto on Trump retaking the Oval Office. With more than $35 million in bets being quickly poured into the presidential election market, it’s no wonder Trump appears to be ahead.\nSome political and betting experts have said prediction markets are the most accurate way to foresee election outcomes because people are betting real money on a particular outcome. The way prediction markets work is that traders buy shares depending on which outcome they think is more likely. Share prices or “odds” rise and fall depending on demand, so if the event happens the way the trader predicted, the contract or “bet” will rise to $1 and pay out—or fall to $0 if it does not.\n“Political betting sites are the best at predicting the wisdom of the crowd,” Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Fortune’s Shawn Tully. Miller is known for his accurate calls for the 2020 election, and some of his methodology comes from examining prediction markets.\nBut other experts aren’t so sure, particularly since Polymarket allows users to place bets only using cryptocurrency—and U.S. voters aren’t even allowed to participate.\n“I could not disagree more with that thesis,” George Kailas, CEO of stock-market intelligence tool Prospero.ai, told Fortune. “People are spending money around what they want to happen, not some strong underlying logic or reason.”\nPlus, given that Polymarket is crypto-based and Trump is pro-crypto, “it would seem to be an indicator that Trump supporters are just more willing to bet on him than ‘wisdom,’” Kailas adds.\nTo be sure, Cliff Young, a pollster and president of public affairs for Ipsos, told Fortune betting markets are “about as good as the polls.” Although the “Presidential Election Winner 2024” market shows Trump with a great advantage over Harris, the “Popular Vote Winner 2024” shows Harris in the lead. Young said this could be because Trump appears to be stronger in the swing states.\nWhile “Harris leads in the national race, which has leaned Democrat over the last few decades, the swing states define the election,” Young said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Stocks just had their best week of 2024.\nAll three major indexes pressed to record highs after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election.\nFor the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 4.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose nearly 6%.\nIn the week ahead, a fresh reading on inflation and retail sales will lead the economic calendar.\nIn corporate news, quarterly results from Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), and Disney (DIS) will highlight another week of earnings reports.\nIn a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Thursday. In a press conference following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to comment on the central bank's plans for future rate cuts.\n\"We don’t think it’s a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance,\" Powell said. He later noted that Fed officials will need to gauge the economic data released between now and December before knowing if the central bank will cut interest rates again this year.\nThe first data the Fed will consider ahead of its next meeting will come out on Wednesday with the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 2.6% annually in October, an increase from the 2.4% rise in September. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, in line with the increase seen in September.\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to have risen 3.3% over last year in October, unchanged from September's increase. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the September gain.\n\"The October CPI report will likely support the notion that the last mile of inflation's journey back to target will be the hardest,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday.\nThe final monthly retail sales report before the start of the holiday shopping season is set for release on Thursday. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.3% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.3%.\nEntering the release, several trackers point to the fourth quarter being off to a solid start for economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker currently projects the US economy growing at 2.5%.\nDisney is set to report quarterly results before the bell on Thursday as the media giant looks to continue to improve its streaming business amid further declines in linear television. Investors will also be focused on results within the company's theme park business after the segment fell short in its most recent quarter. \nStreaming profitability should be a bright spot after the company reported its first quarter of profits for that business in August. The segment should get a boost from recent price hikes along with the continued rollout of Disney's password-sharing crackdown across its various platforms.\nShares are up about 9% this year.\nIn a roaring rally over the final three trading sessions of the week, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy.\nBig Tech also saw significant upside. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — hit a fresh record highs on both Thursday and Friday.\nThree of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon, outpaced the S&P 500 on the week, with Alphabet also coming close. Tesla had a unique Trump-related catalyst, with investors banking on CEO Elon Musk's big bet on the president-elect's campaign paying off. \nBroadly, markets seemed to be pricing in the potential for less government regulation over Big Tech in a second Trump term. Perhaps indicative of the tech industry's high hopes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all rushed to congratulate Trump on his victory.\nThe week's stock moves also coincided with a surge in Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nearly hitting 4.5%. Strategists have often cited a \"flight to quality\" environment when yields rise, where money flows to large corporations with solid earnings growth and healthy balance sheets. Big Tech fits this mold and saw a rally when yields rose back in the spring.\nSmall caps were one of the beneficiaries of the post-Trump election rally. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) small-cap index jumped more than 5% on Wednesday for its best day in nearly two years.

        "article_content": "LOS ANGELES, June 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- You've seen the TV commercials. It's called the President/Prison Collection and offers your choice of a pro-Biden or pro-Trump coin. The sales are tracked daily on the website PresidentPrison.com. Marketing experts say the sales are representative of voter enthusiasm and may be an indication of this year's U.S. Presidential Election results.\nFor the first time in history, millions of people want either candidate to get re-elected as President or to go to prison. The President/Prison Collection, designed in intricate detail by skilled American artisans and minted to the exact dimensions of the U.S. Walking Liberty silver dollar, commemorates this unprecedented time in history with a set of two coins.\nOne coin shows a re-elected President Biden being sworn into office on the front and Trump imprisoned on the back. The other coin shows the opposite outcome: a re-elected President Trump being sworn into office on the front and an imprisoned Biden on the back. These keepsake coins are available in both .999 pure silver and an exquisite 24 kt gold edition, come with custom display stands in Democratic blue and Republican red, and a signed certificate of authenticity.\nAlthough these coins have been designed as a satire of the country's extraordinary political landscape, they have sparked outrage among supporters of both the Republican and Democratic parties, so much so that many media outlets have refused to run the advertisements, further demonstrating that this is one of the most polarized elections in U.S. history. Visit PresidentPrison.com to view the TV commercial rejected by major cable networks like CNN and MSNBC.\nFor those eager to own a piece of history or to forecast the future political landscape, visit PresidentPrison.com while supplies last.

        "date": "2024-06-26T18:13:47.000Z",
        "article_content": "Tax policy is one of the biggest differentiators between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, who are slugging it out in the 2024 presidential election. Biden wants to raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy, while Trump wants to cut those taxes.\nSomething will have to change, because the 2017 tax cuts for individuals expire at the end of 2025. If Congress does nothing, tax rates will return to the higher levels they were at before the 2017 cuts. The top federal rate for wealthy filers would rise from 37% to 39.6% and taxes for most middle-income families would rise, as well.\nOne of Trump’s key campaign promises this year is to make all the 2017 tax cuts for individuals permanent. That could only happen if Trump wins, of course. But now it looks like Trump could have difficulty extending those tax cuts even if he takes the White House and Republicans sweep both houses of Congress for complete control of the government, which is how they passed the initial tax cuts in 2017.\nThere’s one huge thing in the way of more tax cuts: the ever-worsening outlook for the national debt. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently boosted its estimate for the 2024 annual deficit from $1.5 trillion to $1.9 trillion. That’s the largest deficit ever outside of a crisis.\nThere’s no relief in sight. The federal debt is due to hit 122% of GDP within 10 years, up from around 100% now, according to the CBO. Since 2000, federal debt has averaged just 62% of GDP.\nThat 10-year forecast is based on the assumption that all the Trump tax cuts expire at the end of 2025, as scheduled. If Congress renews some or all of them, it will only add to annual deficits, making the long-term debt load even larger.\nMany predictions of a federal debt crisis have failed to materialize, but that only means economists have guessed wrong about when the breaking point will occur. Wobbles in the market for Treasury securities during the last 12 months suggest markets are finally growing uneasy with all the debt Washington is issuing to finance deficit spending. When the amount of Treasury debt on offer exceeds demand or investors get jittery about the government’s ability to pay everything it owes, interest rates will rise, pushing the government’s borrowing costs even higher and triggering an elusive debt crisis.\nEven some Republicans who favor tax cuts as the answer to all economic problems are beginning to express doubts about extending income tax cuts that would add another $4.5 trillion to the national debt over a 10-year period.\n“We cannot — as Republicans who claim to have the mantle of fiscal responsibility — have an agenda that produces greater deficits in the out years,” Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), chair of the House Budget Committee, said during a recent interview with the Hill.\nIn 2017, Republicans relied on the dubious supply-side argument that the Trump tax cuts would stimulate so much economic growth that federal tax receipts would go up, not down. Big surprise: They were wrong.\nThe Trump tax cuts have so far added $1.9 trillion to the national debt, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. When Congress passed those tax cuts in 2017, the total national debt was a mere $20 trillion. Now it’s $33 trillion.\n“Whoever wins [in 2024], those massive deficits are likely to make what will be a difficult 2025 fiscal debate even more challenging,” Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center wrote recently.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nWhile there are two major presidential candidates, there are four possible election outcomes that will determine what happens with taxes in 2025. Biden could win with a split Congress or one controlled by his fellow Democrats, and Trump could win with a split Congress or one controlled by his fellow Republicans.\nUp till now, only one of those four scenarios was likely to produce a full extension of the 2017 tax cuts: A GOP sweep of Congress and the White House. Any other outcome would give Democrats at least some leverage to block a full extension or demand concessions in exchange.\nBut runaway deficits may now prevent further tax cuts even if Republicans manage a 2024 sweep. If Congress were to extend all the tax cuts for another decade, it would take more than half of all individual income tax revenue just to pay interest on the debt. That alone would be untenable.\nOther budget squeezes are rapidly approaching. Medicare and Social Security may be on the brink of insolvency by the time the next president’s term ends. That alone will require belt-tightening at some point relatively soon.\nNone of these gloomy budget projections account for the likelihood of a recession that would depress federal tax revenue and generate public pressure for deficit-financed stimulus measures. Since recessions occur every seven years or so, there’s a good chance the 10-year budget outlook will end up much worse than advertised.\nBiden’s stance on the issue is to let all the individual tax cuts expire at the end of 2025, except for those on workers earning $400,000 or less. That’s more realistic, but even that would add to a national debt that’s already teetering.\nBiden wants to raise business taxes to offset renewed tax breaks for individuals, but he couldn’t get that done during his first two years in office, when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. Second time isn’t necessarily a charm. So voters listening to two candidates compete on how much they want to cut taxes should keep in mind the many other possibilities.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "In the final days leading up to the U.S. presidential election, Elon Musk's X suspended the official account of a progressive-donor-backed ballot initiative called SwapYourVote. The volunteer-run website tries to get third-party voters in swing states to cast their ballots for Kamala Harris, matching them with Democrats in solidly blue states who agree to vote for the candidate of the swing state voter's choosing. The X account was reinstated around 11 a.m. PT on Tuesday after being suspended two days earlier, on Sunday, when X labeled it as spam.\n“The account was caught by one of our automated spam defenses and has been reinstated,\" said an X spokesperson in an email to TechCrunch on Tuesday. X's platform manipulation and spam policy prohibits using automation to amplify information.\nVote swapping, also called co-voting or vote pairing, is a controversial practice that dates back to America's 2000 presidential election, where more than 36,000 Ralph Nader and Al Gore supporters traded votes.\nSo far, SwapYourVote says nearly 12,000 voters have signed up to participate in the 2024 election. While that's a small percentage of America's total voters, it could have a meaningful impact in several key swing states -- such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona -- which are often decided by a few thousand votes.\nSwapYourVote organizers are unclear on what they did to break the policy in the first place.\n\"We still don't know what happened,\" said a SwapYourVote spokesperson in an email to TechCrunch. \"Maybe we got caught up by automated spam filters because the account was new and we posted a lot? It still feels suspicious that this will happen so close to the election,\" this person added.\nContent moderation on X has been somewhat inconsistent leading up to the 2024 presidential election, despite Musk's claimed goal to turn X into a free speech platform. Clemson University recently uncovered a network of 686 AI-powered bots operating political influence campaigns on X, many of which spread pro-Trump or pro-GOP propaganda. In September, X suspended a journalist's account who shared leaked vetting documents for JD Vance. It later blocked links to the leaked document, citing the content as harmful.\nWhen visiting a link to the X account for @SwapYourVote on Tuesday morning, users received a message reading \"Account suspended\" and \"X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules.\" SwapYourVote's social media accounts on other platforms, such as TikTok and Instagram, were still active and accessible on Tuesday."

        "date": "2024-11-05T13:26:11.000Z",
        "article_content": "New economic policy promises typically aren't rolled out during the final weeks of a presidential campaign. But that's one more norm Donald Trump and his allies have been upending in recent days.\nThe pledges have been coming fast and furious, including one last escalation of Trump's tariff promises on the final day of campaigning, with the former president pledging to impose new blanket tariffs on Mexico.\n\"You're the first ones I've told it to,\" Trump told a crowd in Raleigh, N.C., on the last full day of campaigning Monday. \"Congratulations, North Carolina.\"\nIt's a pledge that came alongside recent discussions from Trump and his allies of dramatically changing course on a signature Biden-era semiconductor bill that has catalyzed over $400 billion in semiconductor sector investments. There has even been renewed talk of repealing the Affordable Care Act.\nWhether all of this helps Trump's chance in a tossup contest remains to be seen, but it's yet another factor for last-minute voters to consider as the 2024 contest reaches its end.\nThe series of promises is likely to further worry economists who have long noted that Trump's various plans could spur inflation anew or upend key economic sectors if he takes even a fraction of the dramatic actions referenced on the campaign trail.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nWhat was perhaps the last policy unveiling came on Monday when Donald Trump barnstormed across the country and had a new message for America's largest trading partner: Mexico.\n\"If they don't stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country,\" he told the Raleigh crowd, then \"I'm going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the United States of America.\"\nHe added that if that doesn't work, he will go to as high as 100% duties on Mexican goods.\nIt was a new addition to Trump's intense tariff promises, from 60% duties on Chinese goods to 10%-20% blanket duties on trading allies to 200% duties on automobiles from Mexico.\nTrump claimed that he wanted to hold off announcing this last policy because he didn't want Vice President Kamala Harris to copy it. That's unlikely, with Harris and her allies regularly assailing Trump's tariff ideas as akin to a $4,000 sales tax on the American people.\nTariffs are taxes paid by companies at US points of entry as they bring in goods. Those additional costs are largely passed along to consumers.\nThe reference to a 100% tariff on Mexico led Brendan Duke, a left-leaning economist, to increase his estimate of how much Trump's tariffs would cost a typical family.\nHe has previously estimated that a 20% across-the-board tariff plus 60% duties on Chinese goods would cost that family $3,900.\nOn Monday he said a 100% tariff on Mexico would bring the tab up to $5,700.\nWhile many in the business community have dismissed Trump's tariff promises as bluster, Trump's record stretching back to 2016 has shown he tends to keep — or at least try to keep — his tariff promises.\nMany expect he will impose some flavor of historic new duties if he wins, but the key question appears to be whether the courts would intervene to block it.\nAnother last-minute policy debate is over the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which was signed by Biden and is in the process of sending about $50 billion to the semiconductor sector. That has spurred more than $400 billion in new investments by chipmakers.\nLate last month, Trump told podcaster Joe Rogan that the \"chips deal is so bad,\" prompting Vice President Kamala to remind swing states — specifically Michigan and Arizona — that much of the money was headed to them.\nBut the issue got a new level of attention last Friday when House Speaker Mike Johnson responded to a question about whether he would try to repeal the law, which he voted against, saying, \"I expect that we probably will.\"\nIt didn't help that the comment came during a stop in upstate New York, where money in that bill is set to help spur thousands of jobs.\nAn array of lawmakers immediately weighed in to defend the law, and Speaker Johnson immediately backtracked and claimed to have misheard the question. He said he is only looking to reform the law.\nAs for the chance of repeal actually happening, Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon counseled caution in a Yahoo Finance appearance on Monday. She said, \"The CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips.”\nBut Trump's last pre-election word on this issue appears to be that podcast appearance, where he told Rogan, \"When I see us paying a lot of money to have people build chips, that's not the way\" — suggesting that tariffs were a better approach.\nJohnson has also had to clarify remarks in recent days on what he and Trump would do on healthcare after Trump has floated repealing the law while declining to offer a plan for what would replace it.\nJohnson again amplified the issue when a video emerged of him with supporters saying, \"No Obamacare,\" and adding that the program needed massive reform to work.\nIt was yet another comment that Johnson has sought to clarify; it was also seized upon by Democrats and could be a factor for voters in the final days of the 2024 contest.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how US policy and government affect your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "date": "2024-10-22T11:30:30.000Z",
        "article_content": "While opinion polls predict a close race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump, billionaire investor and former hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, the chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office, on Thursday weighed in with his thoughts on the 2024 presidential election.\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $1,000\nWhat Markets Say: While stating that things are still fluid, Druckenmiller said he liked the market indicators for the elections. In an interview with Bloomberg, the billionaire said in 1980, the market was right on former President Ronald Reagan despite what the pundits said.\n“And I must say in the last 12 days, the market and the inside of the market is very convinced Trump is going to win. You can see it in the bank stocks, you can see it in crypto, you can even see it in Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NYSE:DJT), his social media company,” he said.\nIndustries that benefit from deregulation will benefit from a Trump victory and outperform others, Druckenmiller said.\nTrump is the favorite to win the election now, the billionaire said, adding that the polls do not mean much nowadays as no one even responds to them anymore.\nSee Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThe Scenarios: Druckenmiller weighed in four scenarios, namely a blue sweep, a red sweep, the Trump administration with a blue branch of Congress, and a Harris administration with a red branch of Congress.\nA blue sweep is extremely unlikely, the billionaire said, adding that even if Harris wins the presidency looking at state-by-state polls, it looks like the Republicans are going to win the Senate.\nWhere you got a blue sweep, you would have a rough time for equities for three to six months, Druckenmiller said. This will translate into the economy because equity ownership is 25% of financial assets, an all-time high, he added.\n“So that’s a blue sweep. But the good news or the bad news, depending on how you view life is, I think it’s highly unlikely,” the ex-hedge fund manager said.\nA red sweep is probably more likely than a Trump presidency with a blue Congress, he said. This is because anybody who votes for Trump is probably not going to switch their allegiance, he added.\n“A red sweep, I think you get animal spirits in the business community. You get deregulation and there might be some sort of uplift relative to where they were in terms of the business community,” Druckenmiller said. So I think the economy could be potentially stronger for three to six months, he said.\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\nThe only fear is because the bond yields do not reflect a proper economic outlook, there could be a bad response from the fixed-income markets, which could then snuff out the equity rally, the billionaire said. He also thinks the Federal Reserve will be more hawkish under a Trump administration and red Congress.\nOn the contrary, under a Harris administration with a Republican Congress, probably not a lot of change from the landscape that is currently in place is expected, he said.\nTrump Vs. Harris: Regarding his personal preference, Druckenmiller said he hasn’t decided who he would vote for. “I can’t see my voting self voting for either one of them,” he said, adding that they are actually unified on some things like industrial policy.\n“Both of them think apparently the government should have a major role in allocating capital, which I find frankly.... bizarre,” Druckenmiller said. Both have adopted industrial policy, kind of throwing free-market Reagan capitalism to the side and so their policies are equally bad, with Harris’ much worse in terms it being anti-business, he added.\n\nCheck This Out:\n‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "title": "Analysis-Wall Street girds for Trump 2.0: Tariffs, tax cuts and volatility",
        "date": "2024-11-06T11:29:56.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n(Reuters) - With Donald Trump heading back to the White House, Wall Street is anticipating the potential for lower taxes, deregulation and a U.S. president who is quick to sound off on everything from the stock market to the dollar.\nTrump made tariffs and tax cuts key elements of his pitch to voters, many of whom said the economy was the biggest issue of the election. Another important plank of his platform is expected to be deregulation in areas ranging from the banking industry to cryptocurrencies.\nThe promise of those policies appears to have already stirred prices for some assets, including the dollar, shares of regional banks and the price of bitcoin.\nFor a Trump administration, \"markets are basically thinking it's pro-growth, even if it comes with higher inflation and higher interest rates,\" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS Group.\nEdison Research projected on Wednesday that Trump had secured more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency.\nWhile political developments can move markets, investors say they typically tend to take a back seat to macroeconomic forces and the health of corporate profits as well as global events.\nFor example, the S&P 500 rose nearly 70% during Trump's first term as technology shares soared, even as his tariff policies sparked bouts of volatility. Meanwhile, the energy sector notched deep losses after global economies were paralyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, although his administration was friendly to fossil fuel development.\nHISTORY NOT A GUIDE?\nTrump’s election in 2016 sparked a so-called reflation trade, with investors piling into an array of assets such as copper futures and shares of construction companies on the belief that tax cuts and other stimulative policies would boost sluggish U.S. economic growth.\nBut the economic landscape has changed, and some investors believe the moves of 2016 may not offer an accurate roadmap for how stocks, bonds and the dollar might trade in coming months.\nThe U.S. economy grew by an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to just below 2% in 2016. And while months of restrictive monetary policy have helped tamp inflation down from four-decade highs hit in 2022, some investors worry tariffs or tax cuts could send consumer prices higher again. By contrast, sluggish inflation and growth were concerns for the Fed eight years ago.\nSigns of rebounding inflation could also cause a rethink of the Federal Reserve's interest rate trajectory, with the central bank just beginning to ease monetary policy after hiking rates to bring inflation down from 40-year highs.\nAnd while the last weeks of the 2024 presidential race saw betting markets move in favor of Trump over his opponent, Kamala Harris, his 2016 victory \"was a general surprise, the positive market reaction was a surprise too, and the investor positioning in the runup to elections was for a disinflationary backdrop,\" JPMorgan strategists wrote on Monday.\nTARIFFS AND TAX REFORM\nThe potential implementation of tariffs - which Trump has vowed to increase by 10% on imports, and 60% on goods from China - could make a key difference in how investors approach asset markets in coming months.\nA study by Deutsche Bank said a Trump victory would add about half a percentage point to U.S. gross domestic product if tariffs are not implemented. Tariffs would subtract about a quarter of a point from GDP, the study found.\n\"There are still going to be some question marks as to how aggressive Trump does go with tariffs, and that's going to be a story regardless of the composition of Congress, given that can be pushed through via executive action,\" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.\nTrump also wants tax reform, including reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, for those companies that make their products in the U.S., after having cut the rate to 21% from 35% during his 2017-2021 presidency.\nSuch tax cuts - which will need to pass Congress - could support company earnings and sentiment for stocks, although the extent of such a boost remains to be seen.\nCutting the rate to 15% would boost S&P 500 earnings by about 4%, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs strategists.\n\"In the shorter term, equity investors will look upon favorably a Trump victory because the potential for him\" to extend current tax cuts, said Jake Seltz, portfolio manager with Allspring Global Investments.\nAt the same time, broad tax cuts could spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt when investors are becoming increasingly focused on the federal deficit. Deficit worries have helped spark a recent selloff in U.S. government debt, taking the 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to bond prices, to 4.471% on Wednesday, its highest level since July.\nTrump's tax and spending plans would increase the debt by $7.75 trillion over the next decade, according to an Oct. 28 estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a budget-focused think-tank.\nAn added wrinkle is Trump's penchant to speak on a wide swath of potentially market-moving topics, demonstrated during his first term when he frequently commented on everything from the strength of the dollar to trade to the policies of individual companies. Those remarks occasionally sparked asset price moves.\n\"Markets are a little on edge about the idea that a Trump administration will come with a lot of communication that will be difficult to separate the noise from signal,\" said DWS Group's Bianco.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Writing by Ira Iosebashvili; Editing by Anna Driver and Catherine Evans)"

The idea is based on data showing that some food companies have seen record profits even as they’ve blamed inflation for skyrocketing grocery prices.\nRead Next: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes –Here’s What That Would Mean for the Economy and Your Wallet\nFind Out: 7 Reasons You Must Speak to a Financial Advisor To Boost Your Savings in 2024\nAlthough details of Harris’s proposal remain fuzzy, it has already become a lightning rod for criticism.\nThose critics include radio show host and financial guru Dave Ramsey. Appearing on the conservative Fox News talk show “The Ingraham Angle,” Ramsey pointed to price controls in the 1970s as evidence of the failure of such policies.\n“When you insert government in it and artificially try to cramp prices down, it simply does not work because you can only hold that hose for so long until the pressure builds up, and then it blows on you,” Ramsey said.\nRamsey is not the only one who has pushed back against the proposal. Republicans who back ex-President Donald Trump in the 2024 election accuse Harris of pushing “communist price controls,” Politico reported. Food industry officials have also sounded the alarm about the proposal, as have economists who question whether price controls will be effective in battling food inflation.\n“There are lots of reasons for the high inflation we’ve suffered over the past several years, but aggressive or unfair pricing practices are at bottom of list of reasons, if they’re on the list at all,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch. “It may have been more of an issue back when supply chains were being disrupted by the pandemic, but today it’s hard to point to any significant, meaningful examples of price gouging.”\nEven economists who might otherwise back Harris have criticized the price gouging proposal. That includes Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who worked in the Obama administration.\n“This [is] not sensible policy, and I think the biggest hope is that it ends up being a lot of rhetoric and no reality,” Furman told The New York Times.\nIn a blog shared with GOBankingRates, Debbie Jennings of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation wrote that price controls for groceries “won’t actually fix inflation,” but they could lead to shortages or encourage black market activity.\n“Instead, the administration should consider broad anti-inflationary measures to eliminate government barriers to production, repeal harmful tariffs and reduce deficit spending,” Jennings added.\nIn response to the criticism, Harris’s allies say her comments about price gouging have been taken out of context. Not much is known about how the policy would work, though it would likely allow the Federal Trade Commission to impose fines on excessive price hikes, The Washington Post reported.\nBe Aware: Mark Cuban and Many Other Venture Capitalists Are Supporting Harris for President — Here’s Why\nDefenders of the idea say it merely represents a “targeted” expansion of existing state powers rather than new government price controls.\n“Most of the criticism is from well-intentioned but poorly informed people who are interpreting the elevation of state laws to the federal level as price determination, but part of it is just malicious attacks from the other side trying to characterize her as a socialist,” Ben Harris (no relation to Kamala), a Treasury Department official under President Joe Biden, told The Washington Post.\nAmong those who have come to Harris’s defense is billionaire entrepreneur and “Shark Tank” star Mark Cuban, a frequent Trump critic.\nAs Benzinga reported, Cuban used a series of tweets on X (formerly Twitter) to clarify what Harris actually said. In one tweet, Cuban shared the transcript of Harris’s original speech mentioning the price gouging proposal and noted that it included “nothing about price controls or price caps.” Another tweet pointed out that 37 states, including Texas, already “have price gouging laws” on the books.\nAccording to the FindLaw website, many current price-gouging laws are designed to prevent businesses from hiking prices when a state of emergency has been declared. For example, if an area is hit hard by severe weather, the law would ban businesses from hiking prices more than 10% above their normal levels.\nSome states take it a step further by banning “unconscionable” price hikes for commodities, rental facilities, medicine or household essentials even if an emergency has not been declared.\nOther Harris defenders have tried to calm the nerves of critics by suggesting that her proposal probably won’t ever make it into law, anyway. Such a bill “has no chance of passing Congress anytime soon” even if Democrats manage to win the White House and Congress this year, Politico reported, citing comments from six Democratic lawmakers and five Democratic aides.\nInstead, they say, Harris’s proposal is a “messaging tactic” designed to show that she is attuned to the financial burden that high food prices have placed on U.S. households.\n“I think people are reading too much into what has been put out there,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, told the NBC News program “Meet the Press.”\nMeanwhile, not all economic experts think price controls are necessarily a bad idea in the first place.\nDan Scheitrum, a professor of agribusiness at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, told ABC News that Harris’s plan to crack down on potential anti-competitive practices in the food sector could lower prices for some household staples.\n“If price fixing is taking place and it gets addressed, I expect that could undo some of the price increases,” Scheitrum said.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "date": "2024-08-06T21:49:45.000Z",
        "article_content": "The whipsaw 2024 presidential election continues to surprise. It’s been less than a month since Vice President Kamala Harris jumped from the understudy of the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket to the starring role. Now, polls show her tied with Republican nominee Donald Trump, and in some cases ahead, marking a heady turnaround for once-demoralized Democrats who now sense a chance to banish Trump for good.\nAnd just like that, the “Trump trade” has lost all momentum. The Trump trade is a set of investment choices premised on Trump winning a second presidential term, and, just as important, his party capturing both houses of Congress for complete Republican control of government. That would allow Trump to enact his agenda with minimal opposition from Democrats.\nThe basic premises for the Trump trade are that Trump would slash regulation, raise tariffs on imports, keep taxes low or cut them further, and ignore the mushrooming national debt. Higher tariffs are inflationary and might force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher than they would be otherwise. So higher rates are core to the Trump trade. The economy might grow a bit faster once it mounts that inflationary hurdle. The national debt is a wild card because nobody’s sure when the market will start to balk at unprecedented amounts of federal debt. But whenever that happens, rates are likely to go higher still.\nIf there’s one single company that embodies the Trump trade, it’s Trump’s own — Trump Media & Technology Group, which goes by the ticker DJT. Trump Media, whose main product is the Truth Social network, is almost a pure-play bet on Trump’s election odds. If he wins, it could breathe life into a second-rate social network that has barely any revenue, since Trump will once again be the focus of world attention, routinely making news through his own posts on Truth Social. But if Trump loses, his political career will be mostly over, and Truth Social, puny compared with competitors such as Facebook and X, will have little reason to exist.\nSo how’s DJT doing? Not so great. After going public in March, the stock peaked at $66. Then it tanked in the midst of Trump’s New York business fraud trial, bottoming at $22 in mid-April. It yo-yoed after that, regaining ground as polls showed Trump widening his lead against Biden, even after Trump's convictions in New York. Since Biden withdrew on July 21 and Harris became the heir apparent, however, the stock has mostly fallen. It’s now at $27, down 59% from the March peak and just $5 above the April bottom.\nOther Trump trades are less direct but still in retreat. Market watchers began spotting signs of the Trump trade in mid-July, when Biden was at his nadir and Trump’s election odds in betting markets peaked at around 66%. Around that time, economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research wrote that “’Animal spirits’ have taken on a whole new head of steam because of this growing feeling that Donald Trump is going to emerge victorious.”\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nThe S&P 500 stock index hit its last record high on July 16, driven in part by the prospect of Trump winning the election with a Republican Congress that would keep all the Trump tax cuts from 2017 in place and maybe cut business taxes a bit more. Cryptocurrencies rallied, in part because Trump had turned from skeptic to believer, promising to treat crypto much more gently than Biden if elected. Some analysts also thought Trump 2.0 expectations were pushing rates higher than they would otherwise be, especially with the Fed poised to start cutting as early as September.\nThere were victims of the Trump trade too. In a July 16 interview, for instance, Trump suggested he might not intervene if China attacked Taiwan. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, Taiwan’s most important company, promptly fell 7%.\nNow, with Harris on a roll, Trump’s election odds have dropped from the peak of 66% in mid-July to around 52%. Harris’s election odds are 46%, with third-party candidates accounting for the rest. Harris’s rally seems likely to continue for a bit longer, given that she hasn’t yet enjoyed the “convention bump” that typically follows each party’s nominating convention. The Democratic confab begins Aug. 19 in Chicago.\nMarkets, meanwhile, suddenly have a lot to price in other than Trump. New signs of a slowing economy and out-of-sync central bank policies helped trigger a recent sell-off that trimmed the S&P 500 by 5% in one week. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have given back all their summer gains. Interest rates have dropped sharply during the last two weeks, as if everybody has forgotten about the risk of Trumpflation. Taiwan Semiconductor hasn’t fully recovered, but since Trump knocked down the stock in mid-July it has outperformed the broader tech sector, another sign of the Trump trade in reverse.\nIt's obviously an unpredictable election, so the Trump trade could return if Harris’s momentum stalls or something else gives Trump a fresh boost. It’s also possible a Harris trade could develop, based on the prospect of a Harris win with Democratic control of Congress. A month ago, a Democratic sweep looked like the least possible election outcome in 2024. Now, who knows?\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon is in Washington again this week, and once again he didn’t endorse a presidential candidate.\nThe odds of that happening with 11 days left before Election Day are dwindling fast.\nIn a conversation Thursday at a conference hosted by the Institute of International Finance in Washington, Dimon discussed the importance of collaboration in politics. But he said nothing about either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump.\nOne source close to Dimon said he hasn’t given a full-throated endorsement of either presidential candidate publicly or privately but has favored Harris in private conversations, as the New York Times reported earlier this week.\nThat doesn't mean he agrees with the vice president on everything, this source added.\n\"Yelling at each other doesn't work. Stupid policy doesn't work. Coming up with things that sound like virtue signaling but don't work, doesn’t work,\" Dimon said Thursday while discussing politics, echoing a Washington Post op-ed he wrote in August.\nDimon has at least one more public appearance before Election Day, and the scrutiny of his views has intensified as stewardship of the economy remains one of the top issues in a tight election.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nThe Harris and Trump campaigns both declined to comment this week on Dimon and a possible endorsement, but Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes previously told Yahoo Finance in a statement that both Dimon and former President Trump \"share support of commonsense policies.\"\nEarlier this month, Trump's social media account posted a false claim of a Dimon endorsement, which the banker's aides were quick to note was false.\nDimon's differences with Trump go back to his administration. Dimon condemned Trump after Jan. 6 but more recently raised eyebrows when he said, in a January CNBC interview, of Trump: \"Take a step back, be honest. He was kind of right about NATO, kind of right on immigration, [and] he grew the economy quite well.\"\nFurther clouding the dynamic and the question of an endorsement is whether Dimon would be interested in a role in either future administration.\nThe banker’s eventual retirement as top boss of JPMorgan adds another wrinkle to the intense focus on his actions as the bank prepares possible successors once Dimon is ready to leave.\nEarlier this year, he offered some indication that the timetable for his retirement may be nearing. It's \"not five years anymore,\" Dimon said in May at his bank's annual investor day in New York City. In past years, when asked about the topic, his default response was to say he would stay in the job for another five years.\nDimon has acknowledged his desire to work in some kind of public service capacity, and this week's New York Times story said Dimon would consider a role, perhaps Treasury secretary, in Harris's administration.\nDimon has offered advice to both 2024 campaigns, Yahoo Finance has reported, via informal and formal advisers to both candidates.\nThe source close to Dimon told Yahoo Finance that though Dimon will listen to any candidate, Dimon does not intend to serve in either administration. Dimon’s desire to take such a position depends on whether he could do the job without interference, this source said.\nThat's also a refrain Dimon has made publicly. The subject came up two weeks ago when an analyst asked the bank boss on an earnings conference call: \"If you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?\"\nDimon said in response that \"the chance of that is almost nil, and I probably am not going to do it.”\nOn Thursday, when he was asked if he could ever imagine doing anything besides running the country’s largest bank, he said, “Not really. I love what I do.”\n\"I love this perch, and I do think it's important we use our perches, all of us, to further the interests of mankind and for the interests of our countries.\"\nBut even with Dimon's perhaps coyness, the pressure to bring him to D.C. could be growing, especially if Harris wins.\n\"I love Jamie, and I think he’d do an amazing job,\" billionaire entrepreneur and prominent Harris supporter Mark Cuban told Yahoo Finance earlier this week when asked whether it would be good for America for the Wall Street statesman to become Treasury Secretary.\nAnd even if things don't work out in this cycle for the 68-year-old Dimon, the bipartisan interest in his services could also mean he might land in D.C. in a future administration.\n\"He’s created a bank worth $600 billion,\" William Cohan, an author and correspondent for Puck News, pointed out in a live interview with Yahoo Finance.\nThe role of US Treasury Secretary “would be a very good way for him to exit the bank. … He needs something like this to gracefully exit,” Cohan added.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "In financial markets, October is a spooky month, notorious for crashes, increased volatility and geopolitical skullduggery. Election year Octobers are even more tumultuous, as uncertainty rises and investors try to guess which candidate’s policies they’ll be dealing with for the next four years.\nThis October, however, is turning out to be surprisingly benign. Market volatility has dropped since Oct. 7 and is now at roughly normal levels. Corporate earnings are coming in strong, pushing stocks to record highs. Consumers keep spending as the elevated inflation of the last few years drops toward historical averages.\nThis normalness was about the last thing forecasters expected in the final few weeks of the 2024 presidential campaign.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nAt the end of September, there were warnings galore about an October surprise that could disrupt markets, roil an already unprecedented election, or both. Some possible problems included new signs of a US recession or inflation, which could force the Federal Reserve to halt its monetary easing. There were also worries about stocks being overvalued and a bubble that might pop. More worries: cracks in the labor market that might presage a surge in layoffs and a sharp pullback in spending.\nNone of that has happened so far. Job growth continues to trounce forecasts, and shoppers are still spending. “Retail sales show there is no quit in the consumer,” Oxford Economics declared on Oct. 17 after the September retail sales report showed spending up in most categories. Third quarter earnings are off to a strong start, with bullish traders pushing stocks higher.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat pointed out that revenue growth is up while inflation is down, which means businesses are getting ahead of inflation. “Growth adjusted for inflation is surging,” he told clients during an Oct. 17 update. “I think it’s a high-quality earnings season.”\nAnother possible October surprise was an escalation in the Middle East war pitting Israel against Iran and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah. That actually did happen. On Oct. 1, Iran fired roughly 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, causing minimal damage but essentially assuring Israel would strike back. Oil prices rose on worries that Israel could hit Iranian export facilities and trigger a broader oil war. That also raised the prospect that President Biden and his vice president, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, could be managing a dreadful Middle East conflagration right through Election Day.\nThen came the Oct. 17 death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded last year’s Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel, which set in motion the current war. Sinwar's death, in a Gaza skirmish with Israeli troops, doesn’t end the war or let Iran off hook. Israel is still nearly certain to avenge Iran’s Oct. 1 missile attack.\nBut oil markets have calmed down following reports that the United States persuaded Israel not to target oil facilities. Brent crude traded at $72 per barrel right before the Iranian missile attack. Afterward, it jumped to $81 — and could easily have gone above $100 if there were any actual attacks on Middle East oil facilities. It has now settled back to around $73, which is lower than it has been for most of the year. US gasoline prices are around $3.20 per gallon, the lowest level since last December.\nA sanguine economy in the late innings of an election normally benefits the incumbent, since voters are passing judgments on whether they feel they’re getting ahead under current policies. Harris does not seem to be benefiting in any pronounced way. Consumers are still recovering from the shock of inflation and clearly jittery about foreign wars.\nSince Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket this summer, she turned Biden’s deficit against Trump into a dead heat, with most polls showing the candidates essentially tied. By some measures, Harris should be trouncing Trump, whose disconnected stump ramblings have raised concerns about his age and acuity. Yet she can't pull away.\nBetting markets even show that Trump has the upper hand. People gambling on election outcomes now give Trump a 14-percentage-point margin in the RealClearPolitics better average. But that could be a head fake. The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 18 that on one of the leading betting markets, Polymarket, a small number of very large bets on Trump are skewing the odds in his favor. That could be a deliberate effort by Trump allies to create the appearance of momentum or just an anomaly. Whatever the case, betting markets reflect what traders think is going to happen, not what is actually likely to happen.\nA negative October surprise could still happen, of course, providing a decisive advantage to either Trump or Harris. But it won't be an economic surprise. The US economy will be sound on Election Day, no matter who wins.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

That’s roughly on par with where it started the year at $248 on Jan. 2.\nThose who got in at the start of 2024 spent most of the year watching their investment dwindle, even as the larger stock market delivered impressive gains. Investors who purchased a simple S&P 500 index fund watched their dollars gain 24% since the start of 2024.\nHowever, the year brought many more disappointing days for Tesla investors than joyous ones.\nAfter starting the year at just under $250, TSLA crept toward the basement before bottoming out at a frustrating $142 on April 22. It then reversed course and ticked up to its peak of $263.26 on July 10.\nFrom there, it was down, then up, then down again, then up some more until TSLA managed to lead investors right back to where they began the year — at around $243 per share on Monday, Nov. 4 — one day before Election Day.\nInvestors who got in on the action that day, however, experienced a much different ride in a much shorter time.\nExplore More: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell\nThe markets responded to Trump’s victory with jubilance and optimism, but few companies did better than Tesla, whose market cap hit $1 trillion by the end of election week as Musk’s massive fortune swelled to a new record high.\nMusk was already the richest person in the world when he emerged as a top surrogate and donor for Trump, who vowed to place Musk in a high-profile and highly influential position in his administration if he won a second term.\nMusk’s big bet paid off in spades.\nForbes reported on Nov. 8 that Musk had become the first centi-billionaire whose net worth crossed the $300 billion mark — and Tesla investors saw their fortunes rise right alongside Musk’s. Those who read the tea leaves and plunked down $1,000 on Tesla in the hopes that they could join Musk in riding a red political wave to green dollars did exactly that.\nTesla stock jumped from $251.44 on Nov. 5 to $321.22 at the end of the week on Nov. 8 — and just kept climbing. On Dec. 2, it opened at $352.52.\nThat’s a gain of more than 45%, which would have turned $1,000 on Nov. 4 into $1,450 on Dec. 2 — not bad for a one-month ride with Tesla.\nEditor’s note: Stock prices were sourced from Yahoo Finance and Google Finance and are accurate as of Dec. 2, 2024.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n12 Old Navy Clothing Items You Should Buy in November To Maximize Savings\nThe 5 Most Expensive End-of-Year Money Mistakes, According to Financial Advisors\n3 Major Retailers Who Will Raise Prices Immediately Under Trump -- Tariffs Play Key Role\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Here’s How Much $1,000 Invested In Tesla the Day Before the Election Would Be Worth Today"

        "article_content": "The next presidential election is set to take place in just a few months and Donald Trump is once again a candidate for the position. What this means for you and your retirement savings is still unknown. But one thing’s for sure: There’s bound to be some changes on the horizon.\nLearn Now: Here Are All the Promises Trump Has Made About Social Security If He’s Reelected\nRead Next: 9 Easy Ways To Build Wealth That Will Last Through Retirement\nTo find out what these changes might be, GOBankingRates spoke with two financial planners, Robert Persichitte and Ben Klesinger.\nThese are their predictions for what a Trump win could mean for your retirement savings.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nThe stock market has always been volatile. However, Persichitte (CPA, CFP, CFE), an affiliate professor at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, predicts more volatility in foreign stocks if Trump gets reelected.\n“Trump repeatedly promises to have more control over the Federal Reserve as president. This could seriously destabilize U.S. exchange rates,” he said. “Even if foreign markets are unaffected, a weaker U.S. dollar could mean more expensive imports but also big gains on foreign investments. Trade policies could hurt operations, so there are no guarantees of how the market would react.”\nCheck Out: I’m an Economist: Here’s My Prediction for Social Security if Trump Wins the 2024 Election\nThere’s something to be said about learning from history as well.\n“I also wanted to include a relevant anecdote about the 2016 election. In 2016, you could see that the more popular Trump was, the worse the U.S. dollar performed,” said Persichitte. “On the night of the election, the Dow was down 5% on the surprising news Clinton lost. Before the market opened, my office called an emergency meeting at 8:30 a.m. ET. We discussed how to respond to panicked investors about the immediate hit to the market. To everyone’s surprise, the markets were up. Investors thought the election as a whole was a net positive.”\nUltimately, as Persichitte pointed out, it’s hard to predict what the markets will do — especially in the short term. His advice to those who’ve invested in the stock market is to do so for the long term.\nDuring Trump’s first term, he initiated several tax policies — like the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It was also designed to lower the tax burden on personal income taxes.\nThe TCJA is set to expire in 2025, but whether it does or not depends on many factors, including who wins the next election.\n“If Trump gets reelected, one impact we might expect is the continuation of his administration’s tax policies,” said Klesinger, a financial planner and CEO of Reliant Insurance Group. “The TCJA … could remain in place.”\nIf it does, Klesinger predicts it will impact how people choose to fund their retirement accounts. In particular, he believes traditional IRAs may become more attractive due to the tax-deductible contributions that match the lower tax rates. Roth IRAs, meanwhile, could become less attractive if tax rates increase in the future.\nAs the reelection nears, it’s important to review your investment portfolio, current and expected tax bracket and retirement plan to determine whether everything is on track. Depending on your situation and the results of the presidential election, you might need to make some adjustments.\nOver the past couple of decades, Trump’s views on Social Security and Medicare seem to have changed quite a bit. Back in the early 2000s, he was recorded saying that he believed the Social Security system needed a massive overhaul and cutbacks on funding. More recently, however, he’s promised to protect the system as it is and leave the program as unchanged as possible in the event of a reelection.\nGiven the back and forth, it’s a little unclear what a Trump win could mean for those who rely on these social programs as part of their retirement income.\n“Changes in social safety nets like Social Security could also be on the table,” Klesinger said. He went on to say that any proposals that might cause a Social Security reform or major changes to Medicare could affect retirement planning on a broader scale.\n“If Trump proposes a payroll tax cut funding Social Security, there could be long-term implications for the program’s sustainability,” he said as an example. “Individuals may need to save more in their IRAs or 401(k)s to compensate for any potential shortfall in future Social Security benefits.”\nDuring his initial term as president, Trump made great strides in his deregulation efforts, to promote economic growth and reduce the financial burden many Americans face. One particular deregulatory effort was estimated to save American households around $3,100 a year. Another led to the creation of over 6 million new jobs, lower unemployment rates and increased wages across industries.\nIf he’s reelected, he could continue with these deregulatory efforts. This could be a double-edged sword, according to Klesinger. Deregulation, he said, tends to push stock market valuations higher.\n“This could be beneficial for those holding 401(k)s and other retirement accounts invested in equities. However, stock market volatility is also a risk, especially in sectors like real estate and energy, which can oscillate with policy changes.” Klesinger said.\n“Whoever gets elected will have a massive impact on both financial plans and your account balances,” Persichitte said.\nA Trump win could mean more deregulation, possible changes to social programs and more volatility in the foreign stock market. Each of these could be either positive or negative for retirees.\nBut even if Joe Biden wins, there’s bound to be some changes coming.\n“If Biden wins, we can expect big changes to social programs that ripple through investments. Biden’s big policies are all inflationary measures,” said Persichitte. “Infrastructure investment, student loan forgiveness, healthcare access and education are expected to drive up inflation, which will keep interest rates higher for longer.”\n“If your assets are earning no interest or low interest, you are at risk of your money not keeping up with higher inflation,” he continued. “On the plus side, those types of stimulus tend to prop up the stock market. If inflation is hot, don’t get left behind. Consider risks before investing because the stock market is considered a higher risk than a bank account.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Moves For Building Lasting Wealth: What Smart Americans Are Doing Right\n7 Best New Items To Buy at Dollar Tree Ahead of Halloween 2024\nThe Average Consumer Has $6,329 in Credit Card Debt.

        "date": "2024-12-02T13:25:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Wall Street climbed to new record levels to close out November 2024. It was the best month of 2024 for the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 courtesy of optimism over potential tax cuts and a post-Presidential election rally triggered by Donald Trump’s victory.\nThe S&P 500, the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq recorded 5%, 6% and 7.5% gains in November. The Russell 2000, which focuses on small-cap stocks, outperformed with a monthly surge of 10.8%. Note that the year 2024 has been stellar for equities, with the S&P 500 up over 26%, putting it on track for its best performance since 2021.\nThe year has seen no market correction (a pullback of 10% or more). Historically, the S&P 500 averages a correction once every 346 days, but recent years have been stronger. Since 2000, half of all years have avoided corrections entirely, highlighting the resilience of the current bull market, per CNBC.\n“The prevailing takeaway from November, to me, is that what was true before the election has remained true after the election,” noted Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird Private Wealth Management. He added that the bull market has strong momentum heading into December, buoyed by seasonal tailwinds and a post-election boost, as quoted on CNBC.\nExpectations for lower interest rates have further fueled the stock market rally. Fed funds futures now indicate a 66% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting next month, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool.\nAgainst the above-mentioned backdrop, below we highlight a few winning exchange-traded fund (ETF) areas of the month of November.\nThe Tesla TSLA stock has risen 38.2% in the past month (as of Nov. 29, 2024). With potential benefits from Trump’s pro-manufacturing and deregulatory policies, Tesla seems uniquely positioned for growth. Its leadership position in the EV business should help it weather Trump’s promised abolition of EV tax credits (a move that is likely to hurt smaller players more).\nTesla CEO Elon Musk also joined the incoming administration to end government bureaucracy. Musk will be one of the heads of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tesla shares take a 30% share of the Simplify Volt TSLA Revolution ETF VCAR (which was up about 69% in November), while the bullish Tesla ETF Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares TSLL occupies 60% share of the fund VCAR. In fact, all Tesla-heavy ETFs rallied in November (read: Tesla ETFs Soar on Trump Win: Should You Buy, Hold or Sell?).\niShares Bitcoin Trust ETF IBIT and VanEck Bitcoin ETF HODL each gained more than 38% in the past month. The cryptocurrency Bitcoin flirted with a price tag of $99K last month thanks to Trump’s proposed Bitcoin reserve and domestic mining focus.\nTrump’s crypto-friendly stance to make the United States the crypto capital, the resignation of the current SEC chair and hopes for more deregulation turbocharged the entire cryptocurrency space in November. Options on BlackRock’s popular iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF IBIT also began trading in November (read: Bitcoin to Hit $2,00,000 in 2025? ETFs in Focus).\nARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF ARKX rose 24.5% past month. Shares of Rocket Lab USA RKLB, a key competitor to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, skyrocketed over 154% in November. The surge followed the release of the company’s third-quarter earnings, which surpassed expectations, and the announcement of a new contract with a commercial satellite constellation operator.\nIn any case, the space industry is thriving.  According to a report by McKinsey, the global space economy is estimated to reach a valuation of $1.8 trillion by 2035 (read: Space ETFs Soar on Rocket Lab's Q3 Earnings Beat and New Deal).\nInfraCap MLP ETF AMZA jumped 19.6% past month.The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is driving up gas-pipeline stocks because AI applications, particularly in data centers, require vast amounts of electricity. Natural gas is emerging as a reliable energy source for these data centers. Pipeline operators benefit from this boom as they transport the fuel needed to power these centers.\nMLPs catch investors’ eyes as these do not pay taxes at the entity level and are thus able to pay out most of their income (more than 90%) in the form of dividends like the REIT firms. AMZA ETF yields as high as 6.72% annually.\nWisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund WCLD was up about 18.8% past month. Cloud computing has been at the forefront of the growth in technology for the past few years, offering efficient solutions to businesses and consumers (read: Cloud Computing ETFs That Won Past Month and Have More Room to Run).\nThe widespread adoption of remote work and e-commerce has continued to fuel the need for scalable and reliable cloud solutions. Moreover, advancements in cloud technologies, including AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity enhancements, have expanded the use cases for cloud services, attracting a broader customer base.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "date": "2024-11-22T20:22:27.000Z",
        "article_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Bitcoin extended its streak of record highs after ticking above $99,000 for the first time. The cryptocurrency has rocketed more than 40% in just two weeks.\nNow, bitcoin is at the doorstep of $100,000, just two years after dropping below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The dramatic rally rolls on as industry players expect the incoming Trump administration to bring a more “crypto-friendly” approach toward regulating the digital currency.\nBitcoin was trading at $99,526 Friday afternoon, according to CoinDesk.\nAs with everything in the volatile crypto markets, the future is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts continue to warn of investment risks.\nHere’s what you need to know.\nBack up. What is cryptocurrency again?\nCryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But, chances are, you've heard about it more and more over the last few years.\nIn basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority — meaning it’s typically not backed by any government or banking institution — and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.\nBitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a “digital alternative” to traditional money, but the large majority of daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.\nWhy is bitcoin soaring?\nA lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\nCrypto industry players have welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for — which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape.\nTrump, who was once a crypto skeptic, recently pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.\nHow of this will actually pan out — and whether or not Trump will successfully act quickly on these promises — has yet to be seen.\n“This is not necessarily a short-term story, it’s likely a much longer-term story,\" Citi macro strategist David Glass told The Associated Press last week. \"And there is the question of how quickly can U.S. crypto policy make a serious impact on (wider adoption).”\nOne step Trump must take in the short-term is name a new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which shares oversight of cryptocurrencies.\nGary Gensler, current chair of the SEC, has led the U.S. government’s crackdown on crypto over recent years, penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. But he's also faced criticism from industry players in the process, like the chief legal officer of Robinhood, who described Gensler's approach toward crypto as “rigid” and \"hostile.” Gensler will step down in January when Trump takes office.\nAdam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko, thinks the industry is craving “just some sort of clarity.” Much of the approach to regulating crypto in the past has been “enforcement based,” he notes, which has been helpful in weeding out some bad actors — but legislation might fill in other key gaps.\nDespite crypto’s recent excitement around Trump, McCarthy said that 2024 has already been a “hugely consequential year for regulation in the U.S.” — pointing to January’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, for example, which mark a new way to invest in the asset.\nSpot ETFs have been the dominant driver of bitcoin for some time now — but, like much of the crypto’s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection. According to Kaiko, bitcoin ETFs recorded $6 billion in trade volume for the week of the election alone.\nIn April, bitcoin also saw its fourth “halving” — a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. In theory, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this “supply shock” can also help propel the price long term. Others note it may be too early to tell.\nWhat are the risks?\nHistory shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you’ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.\nInvestors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool — and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. But experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors. And lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could mean less guardrails.\n“I would say, keep it simple. And don’t take on more risk than you can afford to,\" McCarthy said — adding that there isn't a “magic eight ball” to know for certain what comes next.\nWhat about the climate impact?\nAssets like bitcoin are produced through a process called “mining,” which consumes a lot of energy. Operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.\nRecent research published by the United Nations University and Earth’s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin’s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).\nEnvironmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections"

        "title": "Polymarket favors Trump to win the election. Can the site—and its 26-year-old founder—really offer reliable predictions?",
        "date": "2024-11-06T04:36:19.000Z",
        "article_content": "Presidential elections elevate new faces to the national stage. That includes the candidates, of course, but also figures like CNN’s John King or stats guru Nate Silver who have taken on a special oracle status each election. In 2024, the latest to join their ranks is Shayne Coplan, a shaggy-haired 26-year-old whose site Polymarket has become a fixture of political news and whose boosters claim it offers the most accurate signal of the election’s outcome.\nCoplan’s site—which is a prediction market that invites users to bet money on a given outcome—foreshadowed major developments in the election. Those include Polymarket predicting President Joe Biden dropping out and Donald Trump selecting JD Vance as his running mate. On election night, the site received the ultimate vindication when, after weeks of signaling a Trump victory, the Republican candidate appeared headed for victory.\nThis will further burnish the site’s reputation, which had already grown to such a degree that Silver himself agreed to join the company as an adviser. Not everyone, though, is convinced that Polymarket, which has raised $70 million is a reliable election barometer. Skeptics point out that the bettors on the site are not representative of the American public and, more seriously, that a large percentage of transactions on Polymarket are fake “wash trades.”\nSo far, Polymarket’s creator has mostly stayed out of the limelight even as he runs one of the most influential sites in contemporary politics. But that is likely to change in coming weeks as the outcome of the race either cements Coplan’s status as a leading election oracle—or exposes him as a flash in the pan.\nThis is an updated version of this story, which originally published July 31, 2024.\nCoplan grew up in New York City and his appearance and demeanor is closer to an alt-rock band member than a pencil-twirling political nerd. At a dinner party in Manhattan earlier this year, Coplan arrived in jeans and a leather jacket. He had come at the behest of a venture capital firm that had convened startups in its portfolio to network and meet members of the media. Coplan was easy to spot by the unruly basket of curls framing his head, and a casual demeanor that set him apart from the other founders.\nWhile venture capitalists like to say they don’t have a favorite child among their portfolio companies, the organizer discreetly identified “the Polymarket guy” as the one most worth meeting. Coplan, however, appeared in no rush to make the rounds and, after some polite conversing, he left during the main course, apologetically telling the table he had to get to a concert in Brooklyn.\nNew York is a place Coplan knows well. He was raised on the Upper West Side by his mother and attended public school in Hell’s Kitchen near the theater district. As a teenager, he learned to code and, according to crypto lore, became the youngest participant in the initial sale of Ethereum in 2014—a time when the token, which trades for around $2,400 in early November 2024, could be purchased for 30 cents. Coplan would go on to pursue a computer science degree at New York University, but then leave before graduating in order to pursue a growing obsession: crypto and prediction markets.\n“He wants to be able to talk about it forever. This is his life. He lives it,” says Rob Hadick, a partner at the venture capital firm Dragonfly, one of Polymarket’s investors. He added that, at an initial meeting, Coplan eschewed a formal pitch in a conference room and instead proposed a walk, which turned into a two-hour stroll around New York, during which Coplan talked Hadick’s ear off about prediction markets.\nAs books like The Wisdom of Crowds explain, using collective predictions to determine the likelihood of future events is often more reliable than consulting experts. The concept is hardly new, and indeed variations of it—including market-based prediction markets—have been around for centuries. And while there are other online betting platforms like Ireland’s Paddy Power, which lets users wager on everything from sports to politics, Coplan says Polymarket is different.\n“It’s much more categorized as a derivatives platform, where the pricing of such derivatives becomes invaluable real-time info,” Coplan said by text message—pointing to the fact that odds are determined on a continuous basis by a pool of bettors, rather than by a centralized oddsmaker. (Polymarket is also notable for settling and paying out wagers using smart contracts—specifically via a sub-layer of the Ethereum blockchain known as Polygon.)\nIn recent months, Coplan has had the opportunity to talk up the benefits of his site directly with politicians, including at a breakfast with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In July, he also posted a retweet that shows images from the site displayed around RNC headquarters—but so far has been careful not to reveal his own political leanings.\nAsked for a formal interview—something he has not done since 2020 when Polymarket first came to attention—Coplan politely demurs, citing a busy schedule.\nCoplan’s online footprint is a shallow one. There are a handful of pictures online showing a 20-year-old Coplan, sans curls, addressing a crypto gathering and partaking in a boat cruise at the Bitcoin Miami conference in 2018.\nAnd while he has proved adept at avoiding media scrutiny, he may not be able to do so much longer in light of recent evidence that not everything on Polymarket is what it seems.\nMost people are familiar with online betting sites, including U.S. ones for sports betting or overseas ones that let punters wager on everything from elections to probability of aliens landing. Polymarket offers all these bets too, but under the hood it works very differently.\nInstead of a central oddsmaker, the probability of a given event is determined by Polymarket users who can buy “shares” in a given outcome. For instance, on Oct. 31, those who think Donald Trump will win every swing state could pay 26 cents, and if that comes to pass, the value of their contract will rise to $1. (If it doesn’t by election time, it will drop to zero). And, of course, the price will fluctuate in response to news events.\nIn theory, prediction markets like Polymarket are more reliable than polls because people have a financial income in the outcome, which gives them an incentive to be as accurate and truthful as they can. The trouble is that not all the bets on the site are on the level.\nA recent investigation by Fortune drew on blockchain data to reveal that around a third or more of the bets on Polymarket are in fact “wash trades”—a term that describes someone surreptitiously taking both sides of a trade. Doing so can manipulate markets by creating an artificial sense of trading volume or momentum in a given direction. This obviously has big implications concerning the integrity of Polymarket’s betting odds, and for the political process more generally. Polymarket declined to comment on the findings.\nAs for how it plans to make money, Polymarket has resisted tapping into the most obvious source of potential revenue: taking a cut of the wagers on the site. Instead, its evolving business model—which includes a forthcoming feature that will let users pay with credit cards instead of just crypto—appears to involve a media, and possibly a consulting, operation. Semafor reported that Polymarket is in the process of rolling out a series of newsletters, while also pairing with major media outlets that will include its data in their coverage (charts from the site have already turned up in the Wall Street Journal). The company has not disclosed how much, if any, revenue it will earn from these ventures.\nThere is also the potential for Polymarket to charge for given bets to appear on its sites. Currently, the company fields suggestions on its Discord platform, and then informs its community which ones will be added. Some of the most recent additions include whether the AP will call certain states by 8 p.m. and whether Israel will strike Iran’s nuclear facilities by the end of the year. For now, though, there is no indication Polymarket plans to let companies pay to list a bet.\nPolymarket is not the first site of its kind. Earlier crypto projects like Augur and Gnosis likewise offered a decentralized betting platform, but they never got traction. Polymarket, by contrast, has become a fixture of political Twitter and, according to Nick Tomaino—whose venture fund 1confirmation has invested in all of these projects—is the go-to site for 85% of all online wagers on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\nThe site’s rapid growth—it attracted a record 42,000 bettors on July 1, up from 4,000 in January—is perhaps surprising given that bettors in the U.S., where wagers on elections are illegal, are barred from using the platform, and that Polymarket requires users to connect a crypto wallet and pay using the USDC stablecoin. These barriers also raise the question of whether Polymarket bettors—who are mostly non-Americans steeped in crypto culture—can offer reliable predictions of U.S. election events.\nTomaino acknowledges that it would result in a better sample if Americans could participate, but says Polymarket nonetheless offers a very strong signal. This is because, like other prediction markets, it reflects not just the “wisdom of crowds” but is based on a group of people with a financial stake in an outcome, and who are likely to be more knowledgeable.\nIn assessing Polymarket and betting markets of all sorts, it’s also useful to recall that the probable outcomes they display are just that—probabilities. In 2016, most pollsters and betting sites said that Hillary Clinton had a 75% to 85% chance of victory. The fact that she lost does not discredit those predictions, but rather reflects there was a smaller—but very real—probability that Donald Trump would win, and that is the probability that materialized.\nPolymarket is not just an intriguing new fixture of the U.S. election scene. It is also a hot startup whose $70 million raised so far, including a $45 million funding round in May, comes from influential investors. They include not only crypto royalty including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and early Coinbase employees, but also prominent venture capitalists such as Peter Thiel.\nStill, it remains unclear how exactly Polymarket intends to make money. According to Tomaino, the site’s revenue is currently “very low” even as it pays for overhead like an office in New York City and a staff of somewhere between 25 and 30.\nAnd Polymarket’s biggest challenge may be persuading regulators to let it operate in the U.S. at all. In 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, pursuant to the financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank, banned derivatives or so-called event contracts that involve terrorism and other illegal activities, including “gaming.” While the CFTC—which fined Polymarket $1.2 million in 2021 for operating in the U.S.—didn’t define gaming at the time, it is currently crafting new regulations to explicitly ban election wagers.\nThe investor Tomaino is unfazed by all this. He views concerns that election wagers could corrupt the political process as misguided, noting that such wagers have provided insight for over a century and that super PACs—which allow anonymous donors to spend millions of dollars on behalf of candidates—would seem to be a bigger threat to election integrity. As for Coplan, Tomaino says, he will likely become more visible in coming months. But for now he is “just head-down focused on the product.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Microsoft founder Bill Gates is supporting Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race, according to The New York Times.\nSources close to Gates reportedly told the outlet that the billionaire, long known for staying out of politics publicly, had donated about $50 million to a nonprofit supporting Harris's run.\nIn a statement to the Times, Gates did not confirm or deny the donation but said, “this election is different.” Fortune has reached out to Gates for comment.\nAccording to The Times report, Gates is concerned about former President Donald Trump's economic policies and potential cuts to family planning and global health programs.\nNews of Gates’ donation supporting the Democratic nominee comes as sentiment has shifted in recent days about Harris’ chances to defeat Trump in the presidential election. Crypto prediction platform Polymarket, which has $2.3 billion in wagers on the election outcome, is tilted heavily in favor of Trump with 64% odds on the Republican as the victor. PredictIt has similar odds favoring a Trump win next month.\nBillionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, known for his clear-sighted navigation through geopolitical uncertainty, suggested last week in an interview with Bloomberg that market insiders are banking on a Trump win. In that scenario, there would be a “red sweep” of Republican candidates, he said.\n“Personally, I think anybody that votes for Trump is probably not going to change their ballot for a Democrat in Congress,” he added.\nOn the other hand, Harris has continued to attract backers with deep pockets.\nFellow billionaire and philanthropist Melinda French Gates endorsed Harris in July and made a big donation to her campaign. “I feel like Kamala, I was happy to endorse,” French Gates told Stephen Colbert on The Late Show in July. “I’ve worked with her before, she knows what we need in society and she’s using her voice against those issues already on the campaign trail, and I knew she would.”\nFrench Gates previously endorsed President Biden in June—her first time ever declaring for a presidential candidate.\nSimilarly, billionaire and philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs donated to Harris, who is one of her longtime close friends.\nPowell Jobs and her philanthropy and investment firm Emerson Collective have been heavily funding democratic politics for the past several years. Since 2020, Powell Jobs and Emerson Collective have donated more than $3.4 million to democratic nominees and other funds, according to Federal Election Commission filings collected by Fortune.\nUpdated to add details about Gates's political history and other major political donors in the 2024 election cycle.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-11-05T16:15:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "As voters in the world’s largest economy prepare to head to the polls, Wall Street is experiencing huge volatility. This is especially true as the polls indicate a tight race between Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump. Neither candidate holds a meaningful edge in enough states to win 270 electoral votes, reflecting one of the closest presidential races in American politics. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.3% each in Monday’s trading session, a day before the elections, while the Dow Jones declined 0.6%. Meanwhile, the small-cap index — Russell 2000 — outperformed, gaining 0.4%. The U.S. dollar, Treasury yields and bitcoin dropped as investors pared bets on a Donald Trump victory. A weekend poll showed Harris, the Democratic Vice President, leading in Iowa. However, Polymarket continues to show Trump as the favorite (read: Election Strategy: How to Position Your Stock Portfolio).This resulted in enough liquidity in the ETF world ahead of Election Day.

        "date": "2024-11-04T17:00:48.000Z",
        "article_content": "On Election Day, centi-billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos get the same number of votes as you — one. However, during the campaign season run-up to Nov. 5, their voices are much, much louder than yours.\nTrump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: How Would That Impact You If You Are Retired?\nExplore More: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nThat’s because the Supreme Court’s controversial 2010 Citizens United decision determined that political contributions count as constitutionally protected speech — and the impact of that decision is driving the race to purchase the presidency in 2024.\nNo American corporation has donated company funds directly to the Trump or Harris campaigns. Federal law prohibits campaigns from accepting contributions directly from the treasury funds of corporations, labor organizations or national banks. Company employees can donate limited amounts as individuals, but more impactfully, companies and their billionaire CEOs can give as much as they want to affiliated political action committees (PACs) and so-called super PACs.\nThat indirect access to corporate wealth has helped former President Donald Trump raise nearly $382 million for his candidacy. Vice President Kamala Harris has raked in more than $1 billion since entering the race just three months ago, according to Open Secrets.\nHere’s a look at how much America’s biggest companies and wealthiest CEOs are donating, which candidates and parties they favor, and how some hedge their bets and cover their bases by kicking in cash to both.\nTrending Now:\nBoomers Have the Wealth--Why Are Thousands Still Homeless?\nSuze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nHarris: $56,504\nTrump: $16,810\nTotal: $210,267\nIn the world of corporate political activity, Tesla is a virtual non-entity — at least on paper. It donated paltry five-figure sums to both presidential contenders and even less to down-ballot candidates and party campaign committees.\nBut as OpenSecrets points out, “The organization itself did not donate, rather the money came from the organization’s individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals’ immediate family members. Organizations themselves cannot contribute to candidates and party committees.”\nIn terms of donations, Tesla’s rank-and-file support Harris by a margin of more than three to one. But if money is speech, then no voice can drown out that of the richest person in the world. That person happens to be their boss, and no corporate titan has flexed his wealth and influence harder in 2024 than Elon Musk, who Forbes says is worth $268.7 billion.\nOpenSecrets says Musk has funneled more than $118 million into his pro-Trump America PAC, a super PAC dedicated to mobilizing voters in crucial swing states. His all-in commitment and headline-grabbing stunts have have garnered plenty of attention, not all of it positive. CNN reports that the Philadelphia D.A. is suing Musk over a highly publicized sweepstakes that gives $1 million to a different battleground state voter every day who agreed to sign a Musk petition.\nMusk has direct personal and business interests in government policies, including federal EV tax credits, transportation spending, defense and aerospace contracts, corporate oversight and social media regulation. OpenSecrets says his emergence as a principal Trump surrogate represents a sharp break from Musk’s history of making smaller contributions to both parties. It ranks Tesla and SpaceX “in the top 10% of organizations tracked by OpenSecrets for lobbying and political contributions from their affiliates.”\nBarack Obama’s Net Worth in 2024: How He Made His Money\nHarris: $1,233,011\nTrump: $67,847\nTotal: $5,553,740\nLike Tesla, Amazon’s employee donations slant toward Harris’ candidacy. Its founder, Jeff Bezos, joins Musk in the elite $200 billion club, and he similarly has high-stakes personal and corporate interests hitched to government policies and programs. His Blue Origin aerospace company is a direct rival of Musk’s SpaceX.\nHowever, Bezos appears more inclined to hedge his bets than he is to gamble on a winning horse.\nHis Amazon.com PAC has donated a relatively modest $769,000, nearly evenly split, with $386,000 going to Democrats and $383,000 going to Republicans in this year’s federal elections, according to Open Secrets.\nHowever, when you own major media platforms, the most valuable contributions aren’t always financial. Just as Musk’s detractors say he wields his X social media channel as a mouthpiece for right-wing voices, Bezos is currently in damage-control mode after he prevented his Washington Post newspaper from publishing a traditional editorial endorsement, which it was poised to give to Harris.\nHarris: $228,490\nTrump: N/A\nTotal: $15,587,066\nMore than 99% of the $526,819 that the Netflix rank and file gave to federal candidates in 2024 went to Democrats, but in modern politics, a half-million dollars or so is a drop in the bucket. Following a familiar trend, the real Netflix money came not from people, but from PACs.\nOn Sept. 30, media outlets reported that the MAGA faithful were canceling their Netflix subscriptions after the company’s chairman, Reed Hastings, announced a $7 million donation to Harris’ campaign. Fact-checkers quickly debunked those reports. Hastings — a Democratic mega-donor who the New York Times says contributed more than $20 million to party causes in the last few years alone — didn’t give $7 million to Harris. He gave it to the pro-Harris Republican Accountability PAC. That was the largest single donation ascribed to Netflix in 2024, but Democratic Senate and House PACs also enjoyed seven-figure contributions.\nHarris: $1,104,286\nTrump: $22,731\nTotal: $3,660,846\nMore than 89% of political contributions from Meta, the parent company of Facebook, went to Democratic causes and candidates so far in 2024. Although Harris’ political campaign took top billing with more than $1.1 million — nearly one-third of all donations stemming from the company’s employees — GOP causes took the No. 2 and No. 3 spots.\nConsidering the substantial past contributions of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, $3.66 million is an anemic number. On Sept. 27, the New York Times reported that “Mark Zuckerberg is done with politics.” The article spelled out how Zuckerberg stopped funding the many liberal-leaning causes he has long supported with his awesome wealth. His detractors accuse him of the same thing they charged Jeff Bezos with when he pulled the Washington Post endorsement — acquiescing to intimidation from Trump. However, donations are only one way that billionaire bosses of multinational corporations pull the levers of power in their favor.\nWhile Meta gave just $3.66 million in individual and PAC donations, it spent $13.56 million on lobbying in 2024 and $19.3 million in 2023.\nDisclaimer: Unless otherwise noted, all figures are from the nonpartisan, nonprofit campaign finance transparency watchdog OpenSecrets.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n16 Best Tech Deals at Costco This November\n3 Ways a Balance Transfer Helps You Manage Debt (And How Much it Could Save You)\n5 Forms of Stimulus That Americans Can Expect If Harris Wins the Election\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: The Biggest Companies Donating to Trump and Harris’ 2024 Campaigns — How They Impact Elections"

        "title": "Trump warns Mark Zuckerberg could ‘spend the rest of his life in prison’",
        "date": "2024-09-04T20:39:07.000Z",
        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump escalated his longstanding feud with Mark Zuckerberg by threatening the Meta CEO with prison time.\nTrump accused Zuckerberg of “plotting” against him during the 2020 election by “steering” Facebook against his campaign. Trump warned that if Zuckerberg were to do so again in the 2024 election, he would “spend the rest of his life in prison.”\nThe comments come in a new book authored by Trump called Save America. The book features photos from Trump’s term in office with captions describing the events. Trump’s threat against Zuckerberg was in a caption depicting a meeting between the two in the Oval Office.\nTrump began by noting that Zuckerberg would visit him at the Oval Office. “He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes [sic] in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. ”\nHe then accused Zuckerberg of acting disingenuously by praising him and then turning Facebook against his unsuccessful 2020 reelection campaign.\n“He told me there was nobody like Trump on Facebook. But at the same time, and for whatever reason, steered it against me,” Trump’s caption continues. “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison—as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.”\nMeta and Winning Team Publishing, the publisher of Save America, did not respond to a request for comment.\nOver the years Trump has made similar threats to other perceived enemies. During a debate in the 2016 election he memorably told former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton she’d “be in jail” if he was elected. Trump campaign rallies often featured the chant “lock her up” in reference to Clinton. At another rally in October 2022 Trump advocated for jailing a journalist in order to get them to reveal a source.\nThere is no evidence that Zuckerberg was involved in a plot against Trump while he was in office. Nor did Trump’s allegations cite any specific law that Zuckerberg may have broken. The mention of “Lock Boxes” appears to be a reference to a $420 million donation Zuckerberg’s charity made to fund election infrastructure during in 2020.\nTrump has repeatedly feuded with Zuckerberg over the years. In July, Trump made the same accusations that Zuckerberg was interfering in elections.\n“All I can say is that if I’m elected President, we will pursue Election Fraudsters at levels never seen before, and they will be sent to prison for long periods of time,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We already know who you are. DON’T DO IT! ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!”\nZuckerberg attempted to extend an olive branch to Trump after the failed assassination attempt against him in July, praising his bravery. “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life,” Zuckerberg said a few days after the shooting.\nDuring an interview with Fox Business, Trump said Zuckerberg called him several times after the assassination attempt, including to tell him he wouldn’t be endorsing a Democrat. Meta noted he has refrained from endorsing either candidate, as he's done in prior elections.\nEarlier this week, Zuckerberg waded further into politics, writing a letter to the House Judiciary Committee about Meta’s handling of government requests about COVID-19-related content in 2021. Senior officials from the Biden administration “repeatedly pressured” Meta to remove some types of COVID-19 content, “including humor and satire,” according to the letter.\n“I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it,” Zuckerberg wrote.\nIn the letter, he also mentioned the donations he made that provided things like staffing and training for local poll workers during the 2020 election which was severely impacted by the pandemic. In 2020, Zuckerberg’s philanthropic organization that he co-runs with his wife Priscilla Chan, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, made donations to the Center for Election Innovation & Research and the Center for Tech and Civic Life.\n“We are doubling down on our commitment to ensuring that every qualified jurisdiction has the resources it needs to allow every eligible citizen to vote safely and have their vote counted,” Chan and Zuckerberg said in a statement at the time of their donation.\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe donations received backlash from conservative groups that mistook them as support for Joe Biden’s candidacy. For that reason, Zuckerberg said he would not make such donations in the 2024 election.\n“Despite the analyses I've seen showing otherwise, I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other,” Zuckerberg wrote. “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another—or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
