        "title": "Donald Trump’s flip-flopping on early voting isn’t the only reason Republicans are flocking to the polls, election expert says",
        "date": "2024-10-24T09:45:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "After years of begging voters not to cast ballots early or through mail for fear of unfounded voter fraud, Donald Trump has changed his tune on early voting, with his campaign now telling supporters to head to the polls before Election Day.\n“I need you to vote, and I need you to go to the polls before Election Day because they will try on Election Day to keep you home,” Trump told North Carolina voters on Monday.\nRepublican voters have appeared to respond. Early voting among registered Republicans has ballooned, particularly in pivotal swing states. In Nevada, where Biden won in 2020 by a margin of 33,500 votes, 1,000 more Republicans than Democrats have voted early this year. In North Carolina, Democrats lead early voting by just 1%. Last year at this time, they led by more than 30% of the early voting ballots cast.\nWith polling in a dead heat between Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris—with Trump beginning to eke ahead—early voting has become a valuable, yet dubiously reliable metric to try and ascertain the favored candidate ahead of Nov 5. According to longtime political journalist Mark Halperin, early voting is of such consequence that if the rate of Republican early voting continues at its current pace, Trump would win the election.\nBut for a party that has historically opposed early voting and voting by mail and absentee ballots, why are Republicans now turning out in droves to their polling places in October? Experts say it’s not just Trump’s changing narratives on early voting, it’s also a changing Republican party.\nAhead of the 2020 election, Trump was vehemently opposed to early and mail-in voting. His view reflected that of Republicans, who have for decades opposed non-traditional voting measures, spinning the unfounded narrative that more ample voting opportunities compromise election security.\n“Because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to ‘voters’, or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want,” Trump wrote on Twitter in September 2020.\nBut the disruptions of the pandemic made early voting ubiquitous, and Democrats—who have embraced early and mail-in voting as part of their platform, historically advocating for civil rights and fewer voting barriers—benefitted. By mid-October 2020, Democrats had an 18% lead over Republicans among 1.1 million “sporadic” voters who voted early, according to Democratic data firm TargetSmart.\nMichael Traugott, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Michigan, said having seen the Democrat’s success with early voting in 2020, Trump was more willing to depart from his party’s stance eschewing the practice.\n“Donald Trump is not an experienced policy maker or politician with a set of consistent, logical, constrained opinions,” he told Fortune. “I think initially he adopted what he thought was the party's position—which opposed early voting—and then he or the people advising him saw the number of votes that were being cast by Democrats, and they realized they were at a disadvantage.”\nTo be sure, Trump’s change of stance on early voting doesn’t necessarily mean a fundamental shift in Republican belief on early voting, Traugott said. With the practice becoming more common after COVID, more voters, regardless of party, may just be more comfortable with early voting.\n“It’s a little surprising it took the Republicans—individual Republicans, if not the party—[a while] to realize the advantages of early voting and convenience, but now they're catching up,” he said.\nBut beyond changing attitudes toward early voting, Republican demographics are shifting toward the racial and socioeconomic makeup of Democratic voters in past elections, who have favored early voting.\nThe U.S. electorate has increasingly diversified, with more Asian American voters aligning with Democrats, and more Hispanic voters favoring Republicans. Over the past decade, working-class and blue-collar Americans have begun more dramatically shifting red, while white, college-educated voters skew blue. For the emerging blue-collar Republicans, for whom remote work may not be readily available, early voting is suddenly not just appealing, but practical, Traugott suggested.\n“These are people who work regular hours, sometimes long hours,” he said. “Being able to vote at home, at the kitchen table, or in the living room, and to have a couple of weeks to do it is just meaningful in the convenience sense to them.”\nBut there’s still one massive unknown about early voting that won’t be revealed until deep into the night of Nov. 5, Traugott said. Just because an individual is registered as a Republican doesn’t translate to a vote for Trump, particularly as traditionally Democratic demographics shift red and as many registered Republicans pledge to vote for Harris.\n“What we're seeing primarily is the tabulation of returns by registration status,” Traugott said. “It doesn't mean that every Democratic ballot is being cast for Kamala Harris or every Republican ballot is being cast for Donald Trump.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "title": "Trump criticizes ‘rich as hell’ pharmacy benefit managers",
        "date": "2024-12-18T17:32:53.000Z",
        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump criticized pharmacy benefit managers, calling them “rich as hell” and accused them of being responsible for raising drug prices at a Monday press conference. Shares of health care companies with those subsidiaries faltered overnight, an indication of Trump’s power over the stock market, even before he takes office next month.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s continued criticism of pharmacy benefit managers has sent health insurers’ stocks slumping.\nIn a Monday press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump criticized pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who negotiate drug prices between drug makers and insurance companies, calling them “middlemen” who make more money than drug companies. He lamented the high prices of U.S. drugs, which are 2.78 times as expensive as 33 other countries, according to February data from policy think tank RAND Institute.\n\"We're going to knock out the middleman,” Trump said during the press conference. “We're going to get drug costs down at levels that nobody has ever seen before.\n\"I don't know who these middlemen are, but they are rich as hell,\" he added.\nTrump’s comments had an almost immediate effect on the respective parent companies behind Caremark, Optum, and Express Scripts, the three of which make up nearly 60% of the market share of pharmacy benefit managers. Share prices of CVS Health faltered about 1% overnight following the press conference, while UnitedHealth Group’s dropped about 2.5%, and Cigna’s fell more than 4.5%.\nInvestors’ reaction to Trump’s press conference is another example of the president-elect’s influence on the stock market, even before he returns to the Oval Office next year. Following news of Trump’s plan to appoint vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head of the Department of Health and Human Services, vaccine makers saw a $8 billion hit to their market capitalizations overnight; Moderna’s stock dropped 5% following Trump’s decision, and Novavax fell 7%.\nPBMs’ presence remains a sticky subject in the health care world. These third-party companies claim they are often able to lower drug prices for patients by negotiating the presence of drugs on coverage lists, which by extension gives drug companies greater market access. Though Trump claimed pharmacy benefit managers make more money than drug companies, research from the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics found that gross margins for drug companies average about 71% compared to only 6% for pharmacy benefit managers.\n“Any policy that limits the use of PBM negotiating tools would leave American patients, taxpayers, and businesses at the mercy of the prices drugmakers set,” a CVS Caremark spokesperson told Fortune in a statement. “We welcome additional engagement with any federal or state official interested in learning more about the value we deliver.”\nThe Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, whose members include many major pharmacy benefit managers, said in a statement it looks forward to working with the Trump administration to lower drug prices. \n“Whether it’s through negotiations to lower costs, partnerships with pharmacies, or clinical care programs, our value is in helping patients conveniently, safely, and affordably access prescription drugs,” the statement said.\nBut how pharmacy benefit managers are able to negotiate the prices of drugs are shrouded in secrecy. The Federal Trade commission filed a lawsuit against the three largest pharmacy benefit managers in September, alleging they artificially inflating profits by limiting access to more affordable insulin medications and instead guiding them toward more expensive options. The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability released a report in July arguing intermediaries essentially operate in a black box to increase prices or overcharge patients.\nAlthough billionaire investor Mark Cuban frequently butts heads with Trump, he aligns with the president-elect’s stance on cutting out middlemen to lower drug prices. In January 2022, he launched Cost Plug Drugs as an online pharmacy selling generic drugs that discloses price markups, shipping costs, and other fees.\n“It’s impossible to find the price of a drug,” Cuban said in a presentation at the University of Pennsylvania Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics last week. “I don’t mean that they make it too hard to find. I mean, you simply cannot find the price or cost of drugs.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump is making it clear he doesn't intend to ease up on the nation's technology giants once he is back in the Oval Office.\nThe latest sign came Wednesday when he said he would nominate Gail Slater, an aide to Vice President-elect JD Vance, to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division.\n\"Big Tech has run wild for years,\" Trump said in a statement announcing the appointment on his Truth Social platform, \"stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!\"\n\"I was proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice’s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail’s leadership,\" he added.\nThe appointment and comments from the president-elect offer a new signal that his administration could press forward with a series of investigations and lawsuits challenging the way the biggest companies in the technology industry, including Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), maintain their dominance.\nIt was Trump’s first administration that initially sued Google over antitrust concerns, which led to a ruling by a district court judge in August that the tech giant illegally monopolized the search engine market. The DOJ has asked a judge to consider breaking up the company in a separate phase of the trial that won't wrap up until 2025.\nIt was also during Trump’s first administration that the Federal Trade Commission sought to unwind Meta’s (META) acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in a case set for trial in April. Trump's first administration also launched an antitrust investigation into Apple (APPL), leading the Biden administration to sue the iPhone maker earlier this year.\nAnother ominous sign for Big Tech is that last month Trump nominated Brendan Carr as Federal Communications Commission chair.\nJust days before he got that chairmanship appointment, Carr sent letters to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook predicting \"broad ranging actions to restore Americans’ First Amendment rights\" once Trump takes office.\nThat might include \"a review of your companies’ activities as well as third-party organizations and groups that have acted to curtail those rights,\" according to a copy of the letter Carr posted to X.\nThe appointment of Slater to run the DOJ's antitrust division elevates a figure who was a tech policy adviser at the National Economic Council during Trump’s first term. She previously spent a decade at the Federal Trade Commission, including as an adviser to former Democratic FTC commissioner Julie Brill during President Barack Obama's administration.\nThe FTC shares responsibility with the DOJ for enforcing the nation's antitrust laws.\nIn the private sector, Slater held positions at Fox Corp. and Roku. She also worked for the since-dismantled lobbying organization Internet Association, which advocated for the country's most powerful tech firms.\nThe companies included Amazon (AMZN), Airbnb (ABNB), Facebook (META), Google, eBay (EBAY), Microsoft (MSFT), Spotify (SPOT), Uber (UBER), X, and Zillow (Z).\nSlater's boss, Vance, has expressed admiration for the approach of FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has gained a reputation for aggressively pursuing lawsuits and investigations targeting the biggest tech giants.\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that Khan had launched a wide-ranging antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.\nIt is still not known whether Trump will seek to replace Khan and with whom. Slater has acted as an adviser to the administration on that subject.\nThere is also no guarantee Khan’s replacement will hold a similar point of view, or continue her pursuits.\n“We don't know who's going to succeed Lina Khan, but you can bet it's not going to be anyone with the philosophy of Lina Khan,\" said former FTC member and University of Baltimore Law School antitrust professor Robert Lande.\nTrump has sent some mixed messages about how far he wants to go to hold tech firms accountable.\nWhile campaigning, he was asked whether he supported a breakup of Google as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market. Trump suggested that Google’s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\n\"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it’s more fair,\" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview. The former president described Google’s search engine as \"rigged\" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nOn Wednesday, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said of Trump that \"in my conversations with him, he’s definitely very focused on American competitiveness, particularly in technology, including AI.\"\nWhen asked at a New York Times DealBook summit in New York if Trump's election changes the dynamic for Google's antitrust case, he said, \"This is a DOJ case, and the case is already in court,\" noting that it started under Trump's first term.\n\"So I don’t have any particular insights into that.\" The company, he added, will \"defend ourselves there.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Donald Trump has had a surprisingly solid summer, raising the odds, for now, that he’ll win a second presidential term.\nThat's why financial markets are reawakening to the “Trump trade,” with varying implications for stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, interest rates, and inflation.\nTrump’s upturn began with the June 27 presidential debate in which President Joe Biden’s bumbling raised more questions than ever about the incumbent’s age and stamina. Ever since, a swelling chorus of Democrats has been calling for Biden to withdraw and let Vice President Kamala Harris or another younger Democrat take on Trump.\nTrump survived a July 13 assassination attempt and appointed the first millennial to a national ticket by choosing J.D. Vance as his vice presidential running mate. Former Trump challengers lined up behind the former president at the Republican convention, an uncharacteristic show of unity in an otherwise fractious party.\nTrump himself seems to be steering to the center, perhaps in a bid to win swing voters and mainstream business backers. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, he sought to assuage Wall Street fears of chaos in a second term. He said he’d probably keep Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the job through the end of his term in 2026, “especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.” That means lowering interest rates, but only during a Trump presidency—not in the fall, when it might help Biden.\nTrump tried to assure investors there would be no unusual inflation caused by new tariffs without explaining how he’d work that magic. He even suggested he’d consider JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary, which would put a Wall Street eminence in the job, should Dimon accept.\nElection scenarios are now nudging earnings and inflation off the radar screen as top investor concerns. “‘Animal spirits’ have taken on a whole new head of steam because of this growing feeling that Donald Trump is going to emerge victorious,” economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research wrote to clients on July 17. “No wonder investors are foaming at the mouth.”\nBetting markets — which can be spurious — now give Trump 66% odds of winning, according to the RealClearPolitics average. That suggests rising odds of not just a Trump win, but of a Republican sweep in which the GOP wins both houses of Congress too, giving it unified control of the government.\nThat would open the door to more corporate tax cuts, which Democrats would likely block if they controlled at least one chamber of Congress. Rosenberg views the GOP sweep scenario as a contributor to the recent investor rotation out of tech stocks into smaller companies deemed value stocks on the theory that more tax cuts would help smaller shares catch up in value to the so-called Magnificent Seven.\nCryptocurrencies have been another beneficiary of Trump’s rising fortunes. Trump, once a crypto skeptic, now pledges to end government efforts to regulate crypto in a bid to capture younger voters smitten with the trend. The value of bitcoin jumped by $1,000 during the first hour after Trump survived the July 13 shooting as buyers bet the failed assassination would boost Trump’s election odds. During the next four days, bitcoin rose by another $4,500. Most other cryptos followed bitcoin higher.\nBut the outlook for a second Trump presidency isn’t entirely bullish.\nFor instance, Trump’s plans to boost import tariffs and roust undocumented immigrants out of the country are both inflationary, since they would raise the prices of imported goods on their face and probably also boost labor costs by making workers in some industries more scarce.\nThat could undo the considerable progress of the last two years, with inflation falling sharply from its 2022 peak, prompting hope that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates as soon as September. Any sign of resurgent inflation — including possible Trump policies — could interfere with that and keep interest rates elevated. Some analysts think interest rates are already higher than they would otherwise be because investors are beginning to price in the effect of inflationary Trump policies.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nInvestors are also sniffing around for specific sectors or companies that could benefit or suffer under a second Trump term. During the Bloomberg interview, for instance, Trump suggested he wouldn’t aid Taiwan if China attacked, even though Taiwan is a key source of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, which are fundamental to the US economy and to the artificial intelligence boom. Or, he said, Taiwan should pay the United States for its protection.\nTech stocks promptly sold off, leading to a 2.5% one-day drop in the Nasdaq stock index on July 17. “Some of the pressure on big tech stocks today seems to be tied to [Trump] remarks that Taiwan should pay for US defense,” Capital Economics explained on July 17, the day Bloomberg published the Trump interview. Shares of TSMC, Taiwan’s semiconductor giant, fell by 7% on the news.\nThough he’s having a good run, Trump is not a shoo-in.\nFor all of Biden’s woes, he’s less than three points behind Trump in the Cook Political Report polling average.\nAnd an already unpredictable race could get woolier still. Biden could still withdraw, with a less familiar Democrat taking his place. Trump is also due to be sentenced on 34 felony convictions in the New York City fraud trial on Sept. 18, just six weeks before the election. And both candidates are elderly and frail in their way, elevating the odds of a health emergency in the home stretch of the election.\nWhatever markets price in today they could price out tomorrow.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-10-06T13:00:07.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump has spent considerable time on the campaign trail this year invoking a president who has been dead for more than 123 years: William McKinley.\nThe reason: McKinley and Trump's shared affinity for tariffs.\nMcKinley, who served as president from 1896 to 1901, was an ultra-protectionist politician who arrived at the White House having already pushed through a key piece of legislation that boosted tariffs on many American products. The \"McKinley Tariff of 1890\" was even named after him.\nNow, Trump wants to return America to McKinley's era, with tariffs at the center of government policy and the US budget.\n\"In the 1890s, our country was probably the wealthiest it ever was because it was a system of tariffs,\" Trump told a Michigan crowd recently.\nThe 45th president added just this Friday in a Fox Business interview that McKinley, the 25th president, \"was a big tariff guy.\"\nBut the story that Trump has repeatedly told is one that, according to historians, overlooks key details of that era.\nThey note that the shortcomings of tariffs became evident in McKinley's time and began to forge a free-trade consensus that eventually pushed tariffs out of vogue for nearly a century — basically until Trump arrived on the scene.\nThe story Trump tells also overlooks McKinley's own journey on the issue.\n\"Ultimately, Trump is missing the McKinley point,\" said McKinley biographer Robert Merry in a recent interview.\nMerry notes that McKinley indeed built his reputation on protectionist policies but began to see the limits of tariffs near the end of his presidency. He concluded that for US success to continue, it would need a freer flow of goods and reciprocity with global trading partners.\n\"And he was absolutely right about that,\" Merry added.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nMcKinley died in 1901 at the hands of an assassin. And he was in Buffalo, N.Y., that September in part to give a speech prodding the nation in a more free-trade direction.\n\"It was the high-water mark because once you start to get to the 20th century, many Americans have now said enough is enough,\" added tariff historian William Bolt in an interview.\nHigh duties made more reappearances after McKinley, to be sure — notably when President Herbert Hoover signed into law the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930.\nHoover is another president who comes up frequently in 2024, with the Kamala Harris campaign often noting that both Trump and Hoover ended their terms with fewer jobs in the US economy than when they began.\nBut a lasting legacy of McKinley is that protectionism was increasingly seen by the public as raising prices, leading to monopolies, and making depressions worse.\n\"Really ever since then, from the mid-1930s up until 2016 with President Trump, we had been on an unaltered path of lower tariffs and basically free trade in this country,\" Bolt added.\nYet the era remains one of focus and lionization for both Trump and his top aides.\nRobert Lighthizer, the former trade representative who could be up for another run in power if Trump wins, wrote in his own book that McKinley “achieved national fame through his strong and successful support of high tariffs.\"\nPart of Trump's fascination with McKinley also stems from the fact that his era was the last one where tariffs were a significant source of revenue for US coffers.\n\"He made this country so rich,\" Trump said of McKinley this summer in an interview with Bloomberg. \"All he did was tariffs; we didn't have an income tax.\"\nIndeed, in the 1890s, according to White House calculations, the revenue from tariffs constituted about half of federal revenue.\nThat figure is now below 2%.\nTrump has floated scrapping the entire US income tax system in favor of higher tariffs. He has also suggested tariffs could pay for a wide array of programs, from cutting taxes to childcare.\nBut experts say the math simply doesn't add up in the modern economy and with the vastly more expansive federal government of the present.\nSuch a move conservatively would require across-the-board tariffs of at least 70%, according to the White House. Other estimates peg the figure much higher — if not out of reach completely — if such historically high duties ground global trade to a near or complete halt.\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that Trump's highly ambitious plans for a 10% tariff on all imports plus 60% on imports from China would raise $225 billion a year, before taking into account retaliatory steps taken by other countries.\nThat's far less than Trump's promises on the campaign trail, which have been pegged at costing around $5.2 trillion and $6.9 trillion over the next decade.\nThere are other reasons some say it may not make sense to return to the 1890s, an era that also came before the Federal Reserve and other economic tools at the government's disposal to smooth out boom and bust cycles.\n\"There was a US depression from 1893-1897 and another national recession from 1899-1900,\" Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell noted online in response to one recent example of Trump lionizing the 1890s. \"Other than that, pretty great.\"\nDetails like that are ones Trump never mentions in his retellings of the McKinley era.\n\"In the words of a great but highly underrated president, William McKinley,\" Trump said at a recent stop at the Economic Club of New York, \"The protective tariff policy of the Republicans has been made and made the lives of our countrymen sweeter and brighter.\n\"History tells us that there are times when tariffs work,\" said Merry. But he added that McKinley began to recognize the era was over, positing that America needed to begin focusing on lowering tariffs as long as other nations reciprocated.\n\"And that's what that speech [in Buffalo] is all about.\"\nMcKinley did deliver that speech on Sept. 5, 1901, but it turned out to be his last. He was shot in the abdomen the next morning by an anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, and he succumbed to his wounds 12 days later.\nIn the years that followed, McKinley’s message was haltingly heeded, with his immediate successor Theodore Roosevelt largely content to keep protectionist policies in place and Republicans maintaining a protectionist streak.\nBut critics of tariffs grew and reached a crescendo with the historic failure of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. It was signed into law by Hoover in the early stages of the Great Depression and then blamed for making the downturn worse.\nTrump aides like Lighthizer acknowledge that the 1930 law was unpopular but contend “as a matter of economic policy, it seems clear that the new tariff law had little if any impact on the economic crisis of the early 1930s.”\nPerhaps one thing the current Trump fascination with McKinley proves is that protectionist impulses run strong in America, especially in manufacturing-dependent states like Pennsylvania, where the politics of tariffs were almost as complex in the 1890s as they are today.\n\"Trump, whether you like it or not, has tapped into that,\" said Bolt, adding that Trump has succeeded in putting forth \"a brand-new issue we haven't really talked about probably in close to a hundred years.\"\nBut at the end of the day, Bolts warned, the McKinley era \"is a cautionary tale.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-11-20T20:25:25.000Z",
        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump has named Howard Lutnick—the CEO known for his sharp-elbowed ascent to Wall Street’s upper echelon, as well as his resilience after the 9/11 attacks devastated his company—as his pick for secretary of commerce.\nIn the new role, Lutnick, who has cochaired Trump’s transition team, will lead the incoming administration’s strategy on tariffs and trade and maintain direct responsibility over the Office of the United States Trade Representative, Trump announced in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday.\nLutnick, a longtime New York power player, became president and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street investment banking and financial services firm, in the early 1990s at just 29 years old.\nThroughout Trump’s 2024 campaign, Lutnick—who has donated over $1 million to Trump’s super PAC and hosted a $15 million fundraiser at his Hamptons house this summer—has served as a top economic advisor.\nLutnick was one of the primary voices in Trump’s camp advocating for higher tariffs, in a bid to slash corporate taxes stateside and insulate U.S.-based business from competition overseas.\nFor months, many suspected Trump would tap Lutnick for Treasury secretary, a role that remains unfilled.\nA representative for Lutnick did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nLutnick, 63, climbed the business ladder quickly, but he didn’t have an easy start: Both his parents had died by the time he was 18, leaving him and his two siblings to fend for themselves.\nThe New York native joined Cantor Fitzgerald as a bond trader shortly after graduating college and quickly formed a close mentor-mentee relationship with the firm’s founder, Bernard Cantor.\nEight years after joining, Lutnick was named Cantor Fitzgerald’s president and CEO—having reportedly “elbowed his way to the top” as Cantor was on his deathbed—and five years after that, he became chairman.\n“There is no sugarcoating the fact that before, and even after, Sept. 11, Mr. Lutnick was widely disliked in the industry,” Susanne Craig wrote in the New York Times in 2011. “A ruthless competitor even by Wall Street standards, he has made more than a few enemies over the years. In 1996, as Mr. Cantor, his mentor, lay dying, Mr. Lutnick fought with Mr. Cantor’s wife, Iris, for control of Cantor Fitzgerald. She later barred him from the funeral.”\nCantor Fitzgerald was brutalized by the 9/11 attacks. The firm was headquartered on the 101st through 105th floors of the World Trade Center’s North Tower; the hijacked flight hit floors 93 through 99, leaving those on the Cantor floors with no way of escaping.\nEvery single worker who had been in the office—658 employees—died that morning, representing nearly 70% of the firm’s headcount. Lutnick was dropping his son off at kindergarten that morning and wasn’t in the office, but his younger brother, Gary, also a Cantor employee, was killed. Cantor employees represented nearly one in four of the victims killed in New York that day.\nWithin a week, Lutnick returned to the trading desk and, amid widespread criticism, announced the firm would be cutting off paychecks to its deceased employees. He later pledged 25% of the firm’s profits over the next decade to their next of kin, along with ongoing health insurance coverage. He also gave them $90 million from his own personal savings.\nToday, Lutnick stands as one of Wall Street’s longest-serving CEOs, with 41 years at the helm of Cantor Fitzgerald. During his tenure, Lutnick has overseen the $1.3 billion merger of BGC Partners, a financial services company, with eSpeed, an electronic bond trading platform, as well as taken Rumble, a video platform, public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Earlier this year, through BGC Group—of which Lutnick is also CEO—he unveiled a futures exchange called FMX, which counts Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Goldman Sachs among its equity partners. Meanwhile, his economic stake in the company is about 60%, up from 25% two decades ago.\nOver the past few months, Lutnick has balanced his CEO duties with his Trump campaign leadership by working for Cantor between 6:30 a.m. and 9 a.m., and then from 4 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., with Trump time in between, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nOne of Trump’s primary talking points throughout his campaign has been his commitment to raising tariffs. As commerce secretary, Lutnick will be closer to that promise than any other appointee.\n“Tariffs are an amazing tool [for] the president to use,” Lutnick told CNBC in October, arguing that the Trump administration will use tariffs to “build.”\n“If we want to make it in America, tariff it, or if we’re competing with it, tariff it,” he added.\nLutnick has become increasingly close to Elon Musk, another key Trump advisor, the New York Times pointed out, “and, given the Commerce Department’s role in expanding broadband internet access, [Lutnick] could provide the tech mogul’s Starlink with a significant boost.”\nAs part of the transition team, Lutnick has been instrumental in recruiting and hiring. He has promised to do the same as a member of the administration, NPR reported—exclusively “stacking” the team with “loyalists.”\nMany, however, have voiced concern over Lutnick’s potential conflicts of interest, including regarding cryptocurrency; Cantor Fitzgerald manages a handful of reserve funds for Tether, a stablecoin.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "American voters have chosen Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, handing him a commanding victory against Vice President Kamala Harris.\nA call in the state of Wisconsin in favor of Trump by the Associated Press on Wednesday morning put him over the top, with Trump now set to have the distinction of being the 45th and the 47th US president.\n\"This was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,\" he told supporters early Wednesday morning as he neared victory. \"And now it's going to reach a new level of importance.\"\nThe former president was powered by strong support among men and an intense voter focus on inflation that has been evident in nearly every poll in the years since consumer inflation peaked at a 9.1% annual rate in June 2022.\n\"America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,\" Trump also said on Wednesday, noting his win in the electoral college and his lead, as of Wednesday morning, in the popular vote.\nInflation has moderated in recent years, but it has nonetheless remained front and center in voters' minds, which Trump proved able to use to win Joe Biden voters back to his side and bring new voters who sat out previous contests to the polls.\n“We are going to turn our country around,” he promised voters in his final rally late Monday night in Grand Rapids, Michigan. “I will end inflation very quickly.”\nIt was a refrain he repeated at nearly every campaign stop, including on Wednesday morning, where his podium read, \"Trump will fix it.\"\nTrump's main campaign promises — a new wave of tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants — could put new upward pressure on prices, many economists say.\nA note from Capital Economics late Tuesday night crystallized some of the macroeconomic worries. The authors wrote that they expected Trump to push forward on his proposed immigration curbs and tariffs and, as a result, “we are minded to reduce our GDP growth forecast ... by roughly 1% and add 1% to our inflation forecast over the same period.”\nRead more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?\nTrump has remained undeterred on the campaign trail, pledging to impose new blanket tariffs on Mexico during a stop in North Carolina on the final day of campaigning.\n\"You're the first ones I've told it to,\" Trump told a crowd in Raleigh. \"Congratulations, North Carolina.\"\nTrump has also promised things like 60% tariffs on China and 20% tariffs on America's other trading partners in addition to his promises of duties on Mexico.\nAn analysis from Goldman Sachs projected that a Trump win would negatively impact US GDP growth by 50 basis points, in large part because of a \"hit to growth from tariffs.\"\nWhile economists may be skeptical, voters clearly weren’t in the aggregate, as Trump carried the Tar Heel State by a healthy margin and found new levels of support above his previous runs for the presidency in 2016 and 2020.\nTrump will also immediately be at the center of a fierce tax debate set to consume Washington in 2025 over whether to extend tax cuts that Trump himself signed into law in 2017.\nWhat Trump has promised is a complete extension of the cuts for individuals of all income levels, alongside a dizzying array of additional promises from no taxes on tips and overtime to lowering taxes for big business.\nAll told, a complete Trump tax agenda comes with a price tag in the neighborhood of $9 trillion over the coming decade, according to the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). And he has laid out a few concrete ways to pay for it all.\nBut how far he will be able to go there is largely dependent on Congress, where Republicans have taken control of the Senate but control of the US House is still unclear.\nTrump is also set to have a guiding hand on a wide range of issues from the selection of the next Federal Reserve Chairman (perhaps the only certainty there is that Jerome Powell will not be nominated to a third term) to energy (where Trump may attempt to roll back green energy subsidies).\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how US policy and government affect your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "article_content": "It took almost three weeks for Donald Trump to provide an unmistakable signal that he is serious about fulfilling his tariff promises, setting up a likely flurry of diplomatic and legal maneuverings in the months to come.\nThe president-elect on Monday night announced plans for a 25% blanket tariff on Mexico and Canada and new 10% duties on China \"above any additional tariffs.\"\nThe stated reasons for these new proposed duties are drugs and illegal immigration, with the president-elect surprising many observers by targeting all three of the top US trading partners even before he takes the oath of office.\nThe move was met with immediate resistance, with a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US posting that \"no one will win a trade war.\"\nBut as even Trump himself signaled, there are a lot of steps to come between those dinnertime posts and these duties actually being in place.\n\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,\" Trump noted of his North American plans.\nHere's what could be coming in the weeks ahead:\nThe first order of business is likely to be an intense bout of back-and-forth between these three nations and Trump's transition team.\nOn Thursday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she's confident that a tariff war with the US can be averted after her earlier threats of retaliation were followed by a friendly phone call with Trump.\nReuters reported on Tuesday that Trump quickly held a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after issuing the threat in an apparent opening of talks.\nTalks look certain to be in the offing soon, and that's a moment global nations appear to have been preparing for since Trump's victory.\nAdam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted in a recent digital event before the announcement that many governments \"are making plans to sort of preemptively make offers of various kinds to the Trump administration\" as a way to lessen tariffs threats.\nPosen listed Canada in his talk as one of the nations \"likely lining up offers\" and suggested things like increased energy purchases or moving production inside the US could be on the table. It was a strategy that some nations also employed, to some success, the last time Trump was in office.\nThe question is whether any smaller concessions satisfy Trump and his team and allow them to declare victory and back away from the larger threat.\nRead more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them?\nThe incoming president's initial demand is for all drugs and illegal immigration to cease from the three countries. That is likely impossible.\nAnd the stakes are high, with China, Mexico, and Canada representing America's largest trading partners by far.\nThe top three exporters to the US in 2022 were China ($536.3 billion), Mexico ($454.8 billion), and Canada ($436.6 billion), according to the US Trade Representative.\nIn addition, the top three purchasers of American goods are those same three countries, just in a different order. Canada alone receives 17.3% of total US goods exports.\nJoseph Lavorgna, a former Trump economic aide who remains allied with the president-elect as a senior fellow at the America First Policy Institute, added in a Yahoo Finance appearance Tuesday morning that \"there's certainly a transactional component\" to Trump's announcement.\nHe also suggested some countries, specifically China, may need to offer more concessions to avoid the duties, adding that tariffs are \"a key tool in getting the next administration's agenda done.\"\nPerhaps the next question — if Trump doesn't extract concessions to his liking — will be whether the US political and legal system would allow him to proceed.\nWhat Trump promised in this week's post is to move to implement those tariffs on day one but stopped short of promising they would be in effect immediately\nOn Inauguration Day, \"I will sign all necessary documents,\" he said.\nHis likely authority for such a move is a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump aides have long discussed as a means to move quickly.\nThe law could be notably well suited to actions against specific countries. William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a recent interview that the law gives extensive powers and \"it works better when there's a targeted offender.\"\nBut there's a catch.\n\"No matter what he does, he'll be sued,\" Reinsch added, suggesting that companies would immediately try to block the move through the courts.\nThe legal challenges around duties on Mexico and Canada could be even more complex because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Trump himself signed into law in 2020.\nNew tariffs would appear to violate that pact, which aimed to continue the largely free flow of goods between the three nations. A tariff move could give companies greater grounds to sue.\nBut new tariffs aimed at specific nations (as opposed to blanket duties) could have significant legal protections. Another analysis from Alan Wolff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics explained the president has considerable powers and \"the courts could go along with additional retaliation but not tariffs on everything from everywhere.\"\nYet if any duties come into effect, the impact would surely be dramatic for a range of industries, from automakers and manufacturers to farmers.\nThe effect on energy could also be deeply felt, with new tariffs on Canada likely to impact energy imports from the north unless exceptions are made.\n\"A 25% tariff on Canadian oil would have huge impacts,\" energy analyst Patrick De Haan noted on Monday night.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how U.S. policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump already appears to have a good idea of who might be on his economic team if he wins this November.\nThe ongoing semipublic floating of candidates from the former president is new in that it is starting much earlier than in elections past.\nWhat's familiar is that Donald Trump is once again embracing both loyalists and the wealthiest and most well-known figures from the worlds of Wall Street and Washington.\n\"I love all people, rich or poor, but in those particular positions, I just don't want a poor person,\" Trump memorably said in 2017 of his criteria for selecting officials to oversee the economy.\nMore recently, a picture of Trump's possible economic team has begun to emerge through public comments and signals as well as leaks to the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.\nBillionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson appears to hold, for now at least, a prime position in the effort to become Treasury Secretary among a variety of finance figures.\nOn the Fed, an array of Trump loyalists appear to be in the mix for the multiple slots that could become open in a second Trump term.\nIt's a process that — so far at least — has evoked Trump job searches of the past with a similar mix of evergreen Trump loyalists and a special focus on billionaires, some of whom may not even want the job.\nMuch of the process so far has been distinctly Trump, but other dynamics offer echoes of years past. The Treasury, for example, has often been open to D.C. outsiders — such as Robert Rubin and Henry Paulson — who are able to jump straight from Wall Street to the Treasury's headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue.\nFed chairs, by contrast, have often required years of time in D.C. or academia before they can steer the economy from that side.\nTrump aides have often tried to publicly downplay the validity of the various names being bandied about and didn't respond to a Yahoo Finance request to confirm who might be under consideration.\nHere is a deeper look at some of the most oft-mentioned names and how the process has played out similarly or differently than Trump job searches of years past:\nApparently atop the list at the moment is John Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund billionaire who recently co-hosted a massive fundraiser for Trump at his Florida home. Trump has even publicly floated Paulson for the job.\nIn January, Trump told a New Hampshire crowd that Paulson \"makes a hell of a lot of money,\" adding: \"You know what? Put him at Treasury. You want to make a little money?\"\nReporters at the recent fundraiser — which Trump said raised $50.5 million — even asked for an update on Paulson's likelihood as Treasury Secretary to no avail.\nPaulson appears to be far from the only finance-world figure under consideration.\nThere is Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management investing chief, who co-hosted the recent fundraiser. Also on the various lists are Stephen A. Schwarzman, the Blackstone CEO, and Jeff Yass, the billionaire known for his giant stake in TikTok.\nAll have crossed paths with Trump over the years but have not had extended working relationships with the former president.\n\"I said hello to him, and his wife was lovely,\" Trump recently said of a meeting with Yass that he said was about education.\nThe pattern was similar in 2016, with Trump largely focusing on high finance names when it came to filling that job. Former BB&T CEO John Allison was reportedly in the running back then, as was Jonathan Gray of Blackstone.\nTrump ultimately settled, of course, on Steven Mnuchin, with his resume that included 17 years at Goldman Sachs.\nThe one name on lists both then and now is someone who has said repeatedly he would never take the job: JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon.\nThe powerful CEO did raise some eyebrows with recent comments that Trump was right on some key issues, but the longtime Democrat has repeatedly ruled himself out of consideration.\nHe also released a shareholder letter recently that was notable for doubling down on the politically contentious issue of diversity, equity, and inclusion and outlining a foreign policy that appeared more aligned with Biden than Trump.\nFor Trump, perhaps the main difference between then and now is timing.\nHis most aggressive name-dropping for Treasury in 2016 occurred right as that campaign wound down, with a political reaction evident to a candidate who ran as a populist outsider looking to rich financiers for his most prominent economic positions.\n\"It is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,\" Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky noted to POLITICO at the time about Mnuchin, who indeed ended up getting the job.\nThis time around, Trump is apparently more comfortable floating these names, while these figures are, not incidentally, able to help fund his cash-starved campaign.\nWhen it comes to the Fed, the most oft-mentioned names in news reports and elsewhere have tended to be Washington insiders and loyalists who have worked more closely with Trump over the years.\nOne is former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. He appears to be on the shortlist and was reportedly in contention last time to be Fed chair, but the then-47-year-old was hampered — according to a 2017 Wall Street Journal account — by seeming \"too young.\"\nIt was a process back in 2017 that ended with Trump picking Jerome Powell for the spot.\nThis time around, all the names floated so far are very familiar to Trump. In addition to Warsh, names that have come up include Kevin Hassett, who worked as a senior adviser to Trump, and David Malpass, whom Trump picked to head the World Bank.\nTwo other names include Arthur Laffer, whom Trump awarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Judy Shelton, whom Trump unsuccessfully tried to nominate to the Fed in 2020.\nAs with the Treasury deliberations, Trump's Fed trial balloons have come much earlier this time around in contrast to 2016 and 2017, when lists were apparently narrowed down only once Trump was in office.\nLikely accelerating the timeline is Trump's now-antagonistic relationship with Chair Powell.\nAs for his deliberations, Trump has been clear on only one thing: He won't reappoint Powell, though he hasn't signaled whether he'd look to oust Powell before his term as chair expires in May 2026.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-03-22T15:03:05.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump could net a $3 billion paper windfall after shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) voted Friday to merge with his media business.\nIt comes at a critical time for the former president as he struggles with hundreds of millions in legal judgments and a 2024 campaign fundraising shortfall ahead of his rematch with President Joe Biden this fall.\nThe deal may not, however, solve that immediate cash crunch for Trump, who may not be able to quickly convert his shares to cash.\nStakeholders are likely to be subject to a lock-up period of about six months where they are not allowed to sell or transfer shares unless the company's board votes to make a special dispensation.\nThe vote to merge the blank check company with the Trump Media & Technology Group came during a special meeting of DWAC stockholders. The now-approved plan will allow Trump's company, which operates the Truth Social social media site, to take over DWAC's listing on the Nasdaq within days or weeks.\nThe combined company is set to be renamed after Trump’s company and change its ticker symbol from DWAC to DJT, the former president's initials.\nTrump himself is set to receive a stake in the combined company valued at over $3 billion. Digital World's current stock price, which ticked down Friday, has nonetheless more than doubled this year as Trump has become the presumptive GOP presidential nominee for the third time in a row.\nFriday’s meeting was led by Eric Swider, the chief executive officer at Digital World Acquisition Corp., who said he was excited to see the combined company \"provide a home for free speech and a platform to promote those values.\"\nTrump himself didn't immediately react to the decision but posts dozens of times daily on his social media site and often touts the business's prospects. He said just yesterday that Truth Social is \"the real voice of America!!\"\nWhat remains to be seen is how much access Trump will have to the cash during the coming campaign season. The New York Attorney General is taking steps to seize his assets if he fails to pay $464 million, plus interest, to appeal the recent financial fraud conviction of his company.\nTrump could see assets at risk of seizure as early as next Monday if he doesn't have the cash by then.\nThe expected windfall also comes as the latest 2024 campaign filings from the Federal Election Commission show Biden's reelection campaign significantly out-raising Trump. As of the end of February, the current president has raised $71.2 million in cash on hand versus Trump’s $33.5 million.\nOne option for Trump to get at the cash more quickly would be for the company's board votes to make a special dispensation.\nSuch a move could be possible with the seven board members of the combined company set to be populated by close Trump allies like Devin Nunes, the former congressman and current CEO of the Trump Media & Technology Group; Linda McMahon, a former Trump cabinet official; and Donald Trump Jr., his son.\nTrump could also try to use the expected forthcoming windfall to secure a loan before the lockup period ends. That's seen as a more complicated option, as it would require a bank to offer him the money up front.\nThe two companies first announced their merger plans back in October 2021 but the merger was long delayed by issues such as investigations into the deal by the SEC and a federal grand jury investigation.\nThe merger also faced a lawsuit from the founders of Trump's media group, who alleged a scheme to water down the value of their shares.\nBut with these hurdles apparently cleared, Friday’s vote also marks a return to Wall Street, which Trump has courted throughout his career with mixed success.\nIn 1995, Donald Trump bought 40 Wall St., down the street from the New York Stock Exchange, but the property has proven to be his most durable connection to public markets in recent decades.\nOne Trump foray into public markets began in 1995 when Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts began to trade.\n\"This is such a big day for us, it's the New York Stock Exchange,\" Trump said at the time.\nBut the adventure was short-lived, with the stock falling below its IPO price by 1997 and being delisted a few years later.\nBut one legacy of that effort could live on. The ticker symbol for Trump's company in the 1990s and early 2000s?

        "date": "2024-12-02T18:57:25.000Z",
        "article_content": "Mere minutes after the Associated Press declared the U.S. presidential election for Donald Trump, Singapore’s prime minister, Lawrence Wong, took to the social media platform X to offer his congratulations.\n“I look forward to taking our partnership to even greater heights,” Wong’s official account posted. “We hope to welcome you back to Singapore soon!”\nThe past few years have been good for Singapore, and things stand to get better. The island nation occupies a key position in the region, maintaining close ties to China and the U.S. even as the two powers decouple their economies amid rising tensions.\nSingapore’s recent growth as a financial center has often come at the expense of Hong Kong, its longtime peer and rival that has been pulled closer to Beijing in recent years. And the return of Trump to the White House could tip the scales even further toward Singapore, as the incoming president threatens to tighten the screws on China.\nTrump’s election is a “net positive for Singapore, net negative for Hong Kong,” says Devadas Krishnadas, a former Singapore government official and CEO of the Future-Moves Group, a consulting firm. He predicts U.S. funds will shy away from Hong Kong and its close links to China, and instead continue their march to Singapore: “Singapore will be seen as the only safe place in Asia for U.S. and European capital.”\nForeign capital from around the world is rushing into Singapore’s financial institutions, attracted by political stability, a lenient tax regime, and relative neutrality. Assets under management in Singapore rose to $4.1 trillion in 2023, ahead of the $3.9 trillion managed in Hong Kong.\nSingapore’s race with Hong Kong to be the preeminent financial center of Asia is led by its Big Three banks: DBS Bank, United Overseas Bank (UOB), and OverseaChinese Banking Corp. (OCBC).\nLed by CEO Helen Wong, OCBC—the oldest of the Big Three—perhaps best characterizes the country’s banking sector and best reveals how Singapore navigates this new future.\n“OCBC is maybe the most representative of the Singapore banking sector,” says Michael Makdad, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. “DBS is larger in Greater China, but less outside Singapore, whereas UOB has a larger presence outside Singapore but less in Greater China. OCBC has both.”\nChinese capital remains a major part of OCBC’s business. Southeast Asia is China’s largest trading partner, having replaced the EU in 2020. Bilateral trade between China and Southeast Asian countries reached $912 billion in 2023.\nBut China’s investment in Southeast Asia is changing, says Tommy Xie, OCBC’s chief China economist. “Mining used to be the largest sector receiving investment from China around 10 years ago,” Xie says. “But now the share has really diminished. Manufacturing is one of the largest right now.” And much of the money is in Singapore, which Xie says accounts for just over half of the Chinese money flowing into the region.\nSingapore has also become a safe haven for Chinese companies navigating an increasingly unfriendly world. The Southeast Asian country is a good launching point for Chinese companies trying to diversify their supply chains throughout the region in a “China Plus One” strategy. And some startups, like fast-fashion platform Shein, have quietly established headquarters in Singapore due, at least in part, to hopes that a non Chinese home base might be more palatable to Western investors.\nIf Singapore is going to surpass Hong Kong as a financial hub, core to its strategy is wealth management. The government offers tax incentives to single-family offices that set up shop in the city. As of August, there are now 1,650 such offices receiving these tax breaks, up from 400 at the end of 2020.\nWealth management generated $2.9 billion for OCBC in the first nine months of the year. The company has designated “Asian wealth” as one of its four business areas; just over a third of the bank’s income is derived from wealth management. Earlier this year, Wong pledged to invest an additional $192 million in the cities of Hong Kong and Macau, and its private bank unveiled a target to grow Hong Kong assets under management by 50% by the end of 2026.\nThat could be challenged by the new Trump administration. Both the first Trump administration and the Biden administration imposed sanctions and financial controls on China—first on individual companies, then on entire sectors. Expanded controls under a new Trump White House will force Singapore’s banks to stop working with certain customers and sectors.\nOCBC sees the pullback of U.S. banks from Hong Kong as an opportunity to win new customers. During a trip to the Chinese city earlier this year, Wong noted that “more and more of the Hong Kong customers choose to talk to us, instead of talking to their Western counterparts.”\nOCBC’s official founding dates to 1932, when three local banks merged amid the Great Depression. The oldest of those predecessor banks dates to 1912, giving OCBC over a century’s worth of history in the Southeast Asian city.\nThat same bank, Chinese Commercial Bank, opened a bank branch in Xiamen—then known as Amoy—in China’s Fujian province in 1925. That branch survived through the civil war and the Communist takeover, giving OCBC almost a century of uninterrupted operations in China, rare for a foreign bank.\nFor decades, OCBC was the largest of Singapore’s banks, but it’s since been eclipsed by DBS Bank; today DBS holds around $587 billion in total assets, compared with $448 billion for OCBC.\nWith $18.4 billion in revenue in 2023, OCBC ranks No. 12 on Fortune’s inaugural Southeast Asia 500 list, which ranks the region’s largest companies by revenue. (DBS, with $25.6 billion in 2023 revenue, sits at No. 10, while UOB is No. 11 with $19.7 billion.)\nOCBC also holds a majority stake in Great Eastern, the city’s largest life insurance provider, and offers private banking through the Bank of Singapore, acquired from ING in 2009. In 2014, OCBC also snapped up Wing Hang Bank, a Hong Kong bank, giving it a foothold in both the Chinese city and the Greater Bay Area, a Chinese project to knit together the cities of the Pearl River Delta.\nSixty-two percent of OCBC’s revenue is generated in its home base of Singapore. Much of its non-Singaporean revenue comes from two major sources. Southeast Asian markets, primarily Malaysia and Indonesia, contribute 19% of the bank’s revenue; Greater China, a catch-all term that encapsulates mainland China, Hong Kong, and the island of Taiwan, generates an additional 13%.\nHelen Wong took over as OCBC’s CEO in 2021, the first female chief executive in the bank’s history and the first woman to lead a Singaporean bank. She is No. 17 on the Fortune Most Powerful Women list for 2024: the second-highest-ranking executive from Asia, after Luxshare Precision Industry founder Grace Wang. Wong is also on the inaugural Fortune Most Powerful People list, at No. 71.\nYet Wong’s roots lie in Hong Kong. Born there in 1961, she graduated from St. Paul’s College, one of the city’s most prestigious schools, then from the University of Hong Kong.\nWong’s first banking job was with OCBC, as a management trainee, in 1981; she quickly became the bank’s first China desk manager. She eventually moved to HSBC, starting a decades-long career that culminated in becoming the bank’s chief executive for Greater China in 2015.\nShe returned to OCBC five years later, joining as its deputy president and head of global wholesale banking in 2020. A year later, the board gave her the nod to become the next chief executive, specifically pointing to her China experience.\nHong Kong remains Singapore’s closest competition. The Chinese city has struggled in recent years owing to the aftereffects of its tough COVID-zero policy, concerns over Beijing’s encroaching jurisdiction, and a sluggish Chinese economy.\nBut Hong Kong officials now think they’ve turned a corner and are offering new incentives to attract the world’s wealthy, with a goal of luring 200 more family offices by the end of 2025. UBS predicts Hong Kong could overtake Switzerland as the world’s largest hub for cross-border finance as early as 2026.\nHong Kong’s IPO pipeline, while far from the highs of just a few years ago, is also showing signs of a revival as Chinese companies like appliance manufacturer Midea launch bumper listings in the city.\nSingapore’s capital markets, by comparison, are “a complete joke,” says Devadas, the consultant. Singapore “is not even in the same ballpark as Hong Kong,” even after the latter’s stock market took a beating in the wake of the pandemic. In the first three quarters of the year, Singapore drew just one IPO; Hong Kong drew 45. Singapore’s government has now set up an official task force to tackle the problem.\nHong Kong’s recovering stock market helped the city overtake Singapore as Asia’s leading financial center on a ranking from the China Development Institute, a China-based think tank.\nYet Singapore’s government is “unconcerned” about potential competition from Hong Kong, Devadas says. “They don’t see it as a zero-sum game.”\n“What’s good for Hong Kong is good for Singapore,” Devadas says, noting that the things that support a healthy Hong Kong economy—like a healthy Chinese economy—benefit Singapore, too.\n“But the reverse isn’t necessarily true,” he says. Singapore can tap into other regions much more easily than Hong Kong can, without the baggage of being tied to China.\nOCBC, for its part, isn’t picking between the two. “They are both resilient, international financial centers attractive to international investors and businesses,” Wong writes to Fortune. Hong Kong is key to the bank’s China plans; Singapore to its ASEAN expansion.\nStill, geopolitics could make life trickier for Singapore, even if Washington doesn’t pressure the Southeast Asia country directly. Trump’s promise to impose broad tariffs on all imports entering the U.S. could upend the global trading system, hitting a trade-focused economy like Singapore’s.\nBut Trump’s election also brings opportunities. Greater pressure on China will encourage more Chinese companies to invest in Southeast Asia—and provide even more opportunities for Singapore’s banks, like OCBC, to benefit from those flows. “With more Chinese manufacturing coming [to the region], it must benefit a bank like us,” Wong told analysts during OCBC’s earnings call on Nov. 8, when the bank unveiled record net profits for the year thus far.\n“Everyone comes to Singapore first to start a company,” she said.\nThis article appears in the December 2024/January 2025: Asia issue of Fortune with the headline \"Shifting fortunes.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "US bank stocks rallied following a decisive win by President-elect Donald Trump, a sign that big Wall Street financial institutions expect to have an easier time in Washington under a new Republican administration.\n\"This should aid all banks\" and especially the biggest ones, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo wrote in a Wednesday note.\nTrump's win starts a \"new era after 15 years of harsher regulation\" that followed the 2008 financial crisis, he added.\nBig banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) rose between 11% and 13% Wednesday while Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) each rose more than 8%.\nThe country’s largest lenders have had a great year thanks to the economy's resilience during a period of elevated interest rates and a rebound in their investment banking and trading operations.\n\"I congratulate President Trump and we look forward to working with the new administration,\" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in a statement shared with Yahoo Finance. \"It’s clear that a new administration will bring policy changes potentially important to our business and clients,\" he added.\nAn index tracking 24 of the largest domestically chartered US commercial banks (^BKX) rose 10.7% Wednesday. Its is up 40.5% so far this year, outperforming the broader financial sector and major stock indexes.\nThe hope is next year could be even better if lending and Wall Street dealmaking churn higher while a new Republican administration loosens some rules for big banks and applies more leniency in approving the sort of corporate mergers that produce big profits for Wall Street giants.\nOne big lender that may benefit from such leniency is major credit card lender Capital One (COF), which is trying to get regulatory approval to merge with credit card lender and network Discover Financial Services (DFS).\nThe stock of the McLean, Va.-based Capital One was up 15% Wednesday.\nCapital One CEO Richard Fairbank told analysts two weeks ago that the tie-up was expected to be completed \"early in 2025 subject to regulatory and shareholder\" approvals.\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods predicts that on day one a Trump administration could make as many as eight leadership changes at the federal regulatory agencies that supervise banks or other financial services giants.\nThat includes the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which oversee antitrust concerns, as well as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Securities and Exchange Commission, and potentially even the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nWhat banks are hoping is that a new administration would also loosen a new set of controversial capital rules proposed by top bank regulators that would require lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses.\nThe requirements are based on an international set of capital requirements known as Basel III imposed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis.\nBanks have been fighting this US proposal for the last year in an aggressive public campaign and even dropped hints about suing regulators if they don’t get their way.\nThey won a big victory in September when some regulators said they would water down those requirements. But not all regulators appear to be on board with that plan, putting the final version in doubt.\nSome in the industry expect regulators to scrap the proposal if Trump wins.\n\"If you're looking at how Trump views the world, I think you see less cooperation with international standard setters,\" Allen Puwalski, chief investment officer at Cybiont Capital, told Yahoo Finance.\n“And I think you see the US back out of Basel III.”\nTrump's victory comes at a time when some big bank executives have grown louder about their dislike of Biden-era regulators.\n\"It's time to fight back,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said while speaking at an American Bankers Association convention in New York City last week. \"I've had it with this shit.\"\nThere are some risks, however.\nTrump said little on the campaign trail about how he wants regulators to oversee the sector. That means traders are largely betting on the former president's track record.\nAnd it isn't yet clear what the net impact of Trump's wider economic agenda could mean for the industry.\nFor instance, the fiscal impact of Trump's economic policies are expected to increase the federal deficit by $7.75 trillion through the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nMayo said that a combination of a higher deficit and looser regulation under Trump could create a \"longer-term issue\" leading to a more exaggerated boom-and-bust cycle in markets and the economy.\n\"Nobody wants a repeat of the\" 2008 financial crisis, he added.\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Donald Trump and his allies have floated ideas suggesting that Federal Reserve independence could be compromised if the GOP nominee wins, from firing Chairman Jerome Powell to the president having a \"say\" in setting interest rates.\nBut even as Trump has tried to distance himself from some of those suggestions, a range of other options remain on the table that could fundamentally change the White House relationship with the central bank if the former president wins.\nThese range from the notion of a \"shadow\" Fed chair to ideas laid out in a document known as \"Project 2025\" to an effort to upend D.C. (and possibly the Fed's) bureaucracy.\nAnd these options are circulating as Trump renews his critiques of the Fed following a hotter-than-expected inflation reading this past week.\n\"The fact is that the Federal Reserve brought the interest rates down a little too quickly,\" he told the Detroit Economic Club Thursday. \"Everyone knows that was a political maneuver that they tried to do before the election,\" he added.\nThe issue has also emerged as a clear dividing line in the 2024 campaign, with Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris saying in August that she disagrees with Trump's approach and that \"the Fed is an independent entity, and as president, I would never interfere in the decisions that the Fed makes.\"\nThe Biden White House has also weighed in on \"the importance of an independent central bank.\"\nTrump downplayed the notion of firing Powell directly, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing,\" and has also partially walked back a previous comment about having \"a say\" in interest rate decisions.\nThe idea of a \"shadow\" Fed chair that emerged this past week came from top Trump economic adviser Scott Bessent, the former Soros Fund Management investing chief (and a possible Trump pick for Treasury Secretary).\nHe floated the notion in a Barron's interview that Trump could nominate that \"shadow\" chair to essentially make Powell a lame duck long before his term ends.\nPowell's full term as a member of the Fed's board of governors doesn't end until 2028, but his time atop the Federal Reserve as chair ends sooner, in 2026.\nThis idea would lay out a post-Powell Fed path even while he's still in office, and \"based on the concept of forward guidance, no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore,\" Bessent told the outlet.\nTrump has also already promised he wouldn't nominate Powell to a third term as chair and is already floating possible successors.\nTrump hasn't expressed an opinion on the idea — and a Trump official cautioned that anything not endorsed by Trump himself shouldn't be deemed as official second-term policy — but Bessent himself is clearly top of mind for Trump, who brings him up often at his rallies.\nHe called him \"one of the top analysts on Wall Street\" during the Detroit Economic Club stop this week.\nThe 900+ page \"Project 2025\" blueprint produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation also posits a series of ideas for the Fed.\nThey range from changes to how the Fed intervenes in the economy to institutional changes \"to take the monetary steering wheel out of the Federal Reserve's hands and return it to the people.\"\nTrump has sought to distance himself from the ideas in the book, but it was authored by many of his former aides. The 13-page Federal Reserve chapter was penned by Paul Winfree, who previously served in the Trump White House as deputy assistant for domestic policy.\nMany of the ideas Winfree proposes are focused on paring back the Fed's powers that, according to the book, have overly broadened since the central bank was created in 1913.\nIt would, for example, abolish the Fed's \"dual mandate,\" focusing instead solely on inflation.\nWinfree is also critical of the central bank's ability to influence commercial banks' capital requirements. It's a critique that overlaps directly with a raging current debate in Washington around the \"Basel III endgame\" capital requirements.\nThe chapter weighs in on another ongoing debate: the Fed's policy of \"quantitative easing,\" where the central bank has used purchases of securities to impact the money supply.\nThe Project 2025 proposal would force a winding down of the Fed's balance sheet and also limit future purchases.\nWinfree's biggest idea — and perhaps his least politically realistic one — would replace the central bank with more diffuse banks committed to a concept he calls \"free banking\" — overlooking that the Federal Reserve was created largely in response to the failures of a similarly diffuse system.\nA third area where a second Trump White House and the Fed could clash is Trump's priority of asserting greater control over the federal bureaucracy and independent government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission.\nIt's an effort Trump hasn't said would include the Fed, but Powell and his colleagues could be in his sights. On his campaign website, Trump promises \"a top-to-bottom overhaul of the federal bureaucracies.\"\nThis is an effort to lessen the protections that thousands of government employees have enjoyed from changing political winds. When taking office, presidents typically have around 4,000 so-called \"political\" appointments to make. But Trump and his allies want to balloon that number to more than 50,000.\nAgencies like the Fed and FTC also currently operate at arm's length from the White House, in a structure the GOP nominee has long critiqued.\n\"We need to make it much easier to fire rogue bureaucrats who are deliberately undermining democracy,\" Trump said back in 2022.\nIf his proposed reforms are enacted, he added, \"Washington will be an entirely different place.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Donald Trump is making dramatic new tariff pronouncements almost daily that one could be tempted to dismiss as bluster, but it is increasingly clear that he needs a titanic level of duties to fulfill the promises of his second-term agenda.\n\"I'm gonna put a 100, 200, 2000% tariff,\" he proclaimed last Tuesday in Chicago on the subject of auto imports, promising \"the highest tariff in history.\"\nIt was at that event at the Economic Club of Chicago where he also floated the idea of across-the-board tariffs as high as 50% in order to immediately force companies to relocate.\nBut a significant fraction of that bravado may actually be needed if he wins in November and wants to pay for everything else he wants.\n\"There's actually a logic to the tariffs for his other policy goals,\" said Brendan Duke, a left-leaning economist at the Center for American Progress who has studied the potential economic effects of the tariffs.\n\"It helps him with his math problem\" on issues like paying for his wide array of tax cut promises, he added.\nIndeed, a detailed analysis of Trump's plans from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that one of the only sizable offsets to his over $10 trillion in campaign trail promises is tariffs — which are projected to raise about $2.7 trillion.\nAnd in the report's rosiest possibility — with Trump's tariffs raising more and his programs costing less than many expect — a Trump agenda adds a relatively manageable $1.45 trillion to the national debt because of that tariff revenue. More likely is a shortfall in the neighborhood of $7.5 trillion.\nAll scenarios point to a likelihood that Trump may have little to no motivation to veer away from tariffs in office.\n\"People think he's a dealmaker,\" added Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has done her own deep dives on the economic ripples of renewed trade tensions.\nLovely adds that some common assumptions — such as that Trump is using bluster as a negotiating tactic or that he doesn't really mean much of what he says — rely on a \"really revisionist history\" of how Trump has tended to approach trade issues.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nTariffs are, of course, taxes that are paid by importers at points of entry, with the additional costs levied on these companies often passed on to consumers in the US.\nLovely and a colleague, Kimberly Clausing, have run the numbers and found that even a partial implementation of Trump's ideas — 60% duties on China and 10% on other trading partners — could cost a typical middle-class household at least $1,700 each year in the form of higher-priced goods.\nOther estimates come in even higher (Duke pegs the annual number at $2,500 for a typical family in that scenario and $7,500 if across-the-board tariffs reach 50%), but that has done little to dissuade Trump, who doubles down on tariffs at nearly every opportunity. \nTariffs are \"perhaps the most important element of my plan to make America extraordinarily wealthy again,\" Trump said during a recent speech in Detroit, suggesting that duties should be raised to create reciprocity with other countries' higher duties.\n\"We generally don't charge tariffs,\" he added, promising that would soon change and that his extensive trade wars during his first term in office simply \"started the process.\"\nDuke calculates that what Trump is proposing now is at least 10 times what he levied last time. He said Trump's plans are \"very real\" in large part because of a coming debate on taxes that is likely to consume Washington in 2025, ahead of the expiration of major parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\"What I could imagine happening is Trump makes a bunch of tariff announcements,\" Duke noted, followed by his economic team claiming the duties would raise an outsized amount of revenue in the coming years.\n\"And what's really appealing about that for congressional Republicans,\" he added, is \"they can just cite the offset [and vote for tax cuts], but they don't have to enrage the businesses in their district\" by voting for the tariffs themselves.\nIf such a scenario comes to pass, Duke and Lovely and an array of other experts calculate that the economic effects would be sizable.\nA research note from Goldman Sachs recently crystallized the macroeconomic worries of Trump's plans.\nTrump aides have dismissed the analysis as overly influenced by politics, but the Goldman analysts based their analysis on Trump only actually implementing a sliver of his promises. They suggested his tariff increases on China would amount to 20 percentage points (Trump has repeatedly promised 60%) and that a universal tariff is not their base case.\nThey nonetheless project a Trump win would impact GDP growth by -0.5 percentage points in large part because of a \"hit to growth from tariffs.\"\nLovely, going further, said tariffs in place anywhere near the levels Trump is discussing would mean a massive fall in imports and widespread trade disruptions to the point where \"you're likely to have a recession.\"\nTrump's approach to that topic on the campaign trail has been simply to wave away the concerns.\n\"It's going to have a massive effect, a positive effect,\" he declared Tuesday during his stop in Chicago. He added an attack on his skeptical questioner during that event, Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, calling him \"totally wrong.\"\nThe question is whether it will all be factored into voter decisions.\n\"It seems to me that the point for the Harris campaign will be talking about just how monumental the changes are that Trump is talking about,\" conservative radio host (and Trump critic) Michael Medved said on a recent episode of Yahoo Finance's Capital Gains podcast during a discussion of Trump plans from tariffs to the mass deportation of migrants.\nFurther clouding the waters are complicated issues around tariff implementation. But there is a bottom line that is often obscured: Trump may be able to levy much of his tariff plans without outside input.\nTrump aides have spent years exploring new avenues to help a reelected Trump implement tariffs without Congress, where many tariff-skeptical Republicans still reside.\nFormer Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and other Trump allies have publicly discussed options such as a little-known 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act that could implement at least some of his tariffs quickly — and at higher levels than in his previous term.\nThe main question if he takes that route, trade experts have told Yahoo Finance, is whether the courts intervene.\nTrump could also use national security tariff authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 or Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Those provisions are more legally tested means to levy tariffs without Congress (and both Trump and Biden have done exactly that in recent years).\nIndeed, at a recent roundtable Trump offered of his tariff plans, \"I don't need Congress, but they will approve it.\"\n\"I'll have the right to impose them myself if they don't,\" he added at the event in Pennsylvania.\nThis post has been updated.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how U.S. policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "article_content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\nAnother four-year stay at the White House confirmed.\nFormer President Donald Trump has won a second term as president of the United States after a strong showing at the polls. He will be the nation’s 47th president.\nImportantly, Trump won the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. A confirmed win in Wisconsin — another swing state — put Trump over the top, with 277 electoral college votes as of early Wednesday.\nRepublicans are also set to take control of the Senate for the first time in four years following key wins in West Virginia and Ohio. Control of the House remained in the balance on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) skyrocketed more than 1,300 points to a record 43,569 by midday as investors raced to price in tax cuts, among other policies Trump has floated. Strong gains were also notched on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).\n\"I don't know that it's too much too soon,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). \"If you think about it coming into this [election], there was a real contention between the [outcomes]. So once you gain some clarity, and it looks like this won't extend or be a contested election, there's a relief rally.\"\nTrump's round two has unleashed a host of key trades too.\nTesla stock (TSLA) surged 14% to $286 during the session. The company's ticker page was the most active on Yahoo Finance through midday.\nThe win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the pole position to shape electric vehicles' future given his strong backing of Trump.\n“Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years,” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a client note.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) prices are also moving higher, with Trump promising during his campaign to make the US a digital currency superpower. The move also likely reflects an investor bet on an SEC shakeup that could result in a more digital asset-friendly chairman.\n“With Trump leading the US presidential race and GOP likely to flip the Senate, we believe the regulatory headwind for crypto has turned into a tailwind and the market is nowhere close to factoring in this shift,” Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said.\nMeanwhile, the 10-year Treasury is climbing. Pros believe Trump’s desire to jack up tariffs on imports and cut taxes could push up inflation, which could reduce the pace of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\"Overall though we think that a Trump win means higher inflation in the near-term versus the status quo with Harris, but slower growth (potentially shaving up to 0.5pp off of GDP in 2025 and 2026),\" TD’s head of global strategy Rich Kelley wrote. \"For FOMC policy, we think the Fed will continue to ease this year, but likely take a pause in the first half of 2025 as it waits to get a better sense of the impact of the new administration's policies on inflation and growth.\"\nHere's what Wall Street said on Opening Bid about a couple of key topics in the wake of Trump's historic win.\n\"The Fed is important, but it's probably not as important as it has been. Markets are still pricing in above 90% chance of a rate cut. I think what happens really is more about the policies that compound and what does that mean for growth? What does it mean for inflation and interest rates? If we look at all this together, it likely means whatever path the Fed was on before, they're probably going to move a little bit slower if we have a little bit stronger growth, a little bit more inflation. But overall, I would prefer an economy that's strong, that supports earnings, to an economy that needs more rate cuts because it's weakening.\"\n\"Tesla was one of the shorts that I was proposing last week if Harris had won. Clearly, that's not going to happen. It's all about Musk and what Musk's going to get. And if Musk does get this role at a Department of Government Efficiency, you regulate the whole thing about self-driving, and then that is finally going to be something you can say is really different and valuable about Tesla.\n\"I suspect that this is probably boosterism, and it's not going to be long-term. There are some fantastic things that could well happen for Musk in a new government. And one of the things I sort of jokingly commented about last week, is imagine in Trump's second year that Musk comes in with his undoubted skills and rescues the ailing Boeing. Boeing joins with Musk's SpaceX and creates something new and really exciting.\"\n\"Definitely buy [the \"Magnificent 7,\" which consists of Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla], absolutely 100%. I mean, that's pretty much the one area which has strong earnings growth anywhere in the world. I just don't see earnings power anywhere else in the world.

        "date": "2024-10-19T00:26:13.000Z",
        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has nothing but nice things to say about Apple CEO Tim Cook.\nIn a new interview, Trump revealed the two spoke on the phone earlier this week and said he credits Cook with the tech giant’s success.\n“I believe that if Tim Cook didn’t run Apple, if Steve Jobs did, it wouldn’t be nearly as successful as it is now,” Trump said, referencing the Apple founder and former CEO who died in 2011 from cancer. “I think Tim Cook’s done an amazing job. And I’m not knocking Steve Jobs.”\nTrump made the comments during a podcast interview with Patrick Bet-David released on Thursday. Bet-David asked Trump about his relationship with Cook, after Trump revealed the two had spoken just “two hours” prior to recording.\n“Then two hours ago, three hours ago, he called me,” Trump said during his interview. “He said, ‘I’d like to talk to you about something.’ ‘What?’ He said, ‘The European Union has just fined us $15 billion.’ That’s a lot.”\nIn September a top EU court found that Apple owed Ireland back taxes worth €13 billion, or roughly $14.4 billion. Earlier this year, in March, the EU hit Apple with a $2 billion antitrust fine for allegedly throttling rivals to its streaming service Apple Music in its iOS App Store.\nTrump marveled at the size of the fines the EU levied against Apple, saying they were “a lot.”\n“I even said about Apple, can you pay that? I mean, do you have that kind—that’s a lot of money,” Trump said.\nTrump then drew parallels with his own legal troubles in the U.S., where he was convicted of 34 felony counts in one criminal case, while still awaiting trial in three others.\n“I know the feeling because I get fined, too, and fake cases. But I don’t know if his case is fake yet, but it’s a lot,” Trump said.\nTrump went on to detail his relationship with Cook, which he said had been productive. In 2019, when Trump was in the White House, he had implemented a series of tariffs on certain imports from China. Among the products subject to those tariffs were certain parts needed to make Apple products, which Cook had sought a waiver to avoid. Cook then met with Trump to press his case in person. The former president granted Cook the waiver upon the condition that Apple would invest in U.S. manufacturing for its Mac Pro. In reality, Apple already made the computers in Texas.\nCook would later gift Trump a Mac Pro made at the Texas manufacturing facility.\nRegarding the discussions with Cook, Trump said he appreciated the Apple CEO’s personal involvement in the matter.\n“Most companies send in lobbyists that get paid millions and millions of dollars to talk for them,” Trump said. “And they probably say, ‘We know Trump. We can talk.’ But they don’t. For the most part, they don’t. Tim Cook called me up directly, and he did it himself. [He] didn’t have to pay 10 cents. I gave him 100% of what he wanted because he was right.”\nCook’s argument regarding the 2019 tariffs, according to Trump, was that they would make it too difficult for Apple to compete with Samsung because it didn’t have to import components from China.\nOver the years Trump has always spoken fondly of Cook. “Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly,” Trump said in August 2019. “That’s why he’s a great executive, because he calls me, and others don’t.”\nDuring the interview with Bet-David, Trump recounted how excited he was to receive a call from Cook back in 2019. “He calls. ‘Could I see you, sir?’ He’s the head of Apple. And I was born in Queens, and I said, ‘Oh, the head of Apple wants to see me. Let’s go.’ Even though I’m president I was born in Queens and the head of Apple’s calling.”\nTrump’s fondness for tariffs have featured heavily on the campaign trail during his third bid for the White House. They are now part of a major policy proposal in which Trump aims to level blanket tariffs of 20% on all imported products and 60% to 100% tariffs on goods from China. Economists say the policy would be broadly inflationary and that it would raise costs for consumers.\nWhen reached for comment about whether a future Trump administration would intervene with the EU on behalf of Apple, Trump campaign senior advisor Brian Hughes cited support from “industry leaders like Elon Musk and David Sacks” as evidence of the strength of his economic policies. “President Trump’s agenda includes economic, energy, and regulatory policies that will allow the U.S. to reclaim its global dominance of innovation and technology,” Hughes said in a statement.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

The fact that it's an issue at all is a reflection of the chain's unmatched resonance, with the company previously estimating it is patronized by nearly 9 in 10 Americans at least once a year.\nThe restaurant is a perennial focus for presidential campaigns. This year is no different, from a recent Bill Clinton stop in Georgia, where he hugged a McDonald's worker, to the promised visit from Trump.\nThe attention is unlikely to impact the company's bottom line, experts have previously told Yahoo Finance, with the company tallying up a long record of navigating ever-changing political winds.\nAnd McDonald's stock also reflects the limited downsides of all the attention, with traders recently pushing it to a new all-time high, topping $315.\nRepresentatives for McDonald's itself didn't respond to a request for comment from Yahoo Finance this week on an array of issues, from the impact of the campaign trail attention to the vice president's employment history there.\nVice President Harris helped to first raise McDonald’s as a campaign trail issue this year when (as she has for years) she brought up her time working at the chain and even included a mention in a campaign ad.\nIt was a summer job for Harris that she said helped her better understand less well-off Americans.\n\"Some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck,\" she noted to a North Carolina crowd.\nIt's a relatable anecdote for millions of Americans. According to the company, 1 in 8 Americans have worked at a McDonald's at some point in their life.\nTrump’s response has been to charge again and again and again that Harris never actually worked there.\n\"If I work there for 10 minutes, I'll have worked there for longer than her,\" he told a recent crowd in Reno, Nev., in just one of many examples.\nIt’s a charge that appears to have begun with a Washington Free Beacon story that noted how Harris’s stint at McDonald’s didn’t appear on her résumé. Trump then elaborated on that detail to now flatly claiming she never worked there.\nHarris has chosen to largely ignore Trump's taunts so far but the general topic has spilled over into the wider culture and sparked renewed media fascination.\nRecent stories have delved into subjects ranging from leadership lessons learned working at the chain (Washington Post) and how a stint at the chain is now a “badge of honor” for high-powered officials (Wall Street Journal) to even how much presidential campaigns spend there.\nMcDonald’s is, at the very least, getting plenty of business.\nTrump himself has continued his habit of McDonald’s consumption, putting two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches with cheese atop his requests during a recent stop at a college football game, reported AL.com.\nAll told, according to a Washington Post analysis of campaign finance records, Trump’s campaign has spent roughly $31,000 at the chain since January 2023.\nAnd Bill Clinton’s recent stop came during a visit to Georgia to support Harris and was memorialized by an aide with a video that showed the former president getting a hug from an employee.\n\"This is Bill, y'all,\" the woman said, after first appearing to confuse him with current President Joe Biden.\nThe moment was a throwback to an earlier era when Clinton’s embrace of McDonald's was even more unabashed. The former president loved the chain to the point that a plaque even reportedly adorned the Little Rock, Ark., location he frequented during his time as governor.\n“I've had the best time the last two days,” Clinton then joked at a rally with supporters in Columbus, Ga., last Monday.\nWhat’s unclear is what the (now-vegan) Clinton ordered, if anything.\nThis post has been updated with additional developments.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how U.S. policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "title": "Trump was poised to inherit a strong economy. Then things got rocky and he added to the uncertainty",
        "date": "2024-12-21T13:34:09.000Z",
        "article_content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The smooth economy that Donald Trump was poised to inherit suddenly looks a bit rockier — with critics saying the president-elect is contributing to the uncertainty.\nThe Dow Jones stock index essentially ended Thursday flat after having posted 10 days of losses. The Federal Reserve now sees inflation as staying stubbornly elevated as it has become cautious about further interest rate cuts planned for next year.\nOn Wednesday, Trump blew up a bipartisan budget deal. He then promoted a deal reached with Republicans on Thursday that Democratic lawmakers and President Joe Biden see as unacceptable. It failed to get the two-thirds threshold needed for House passage. This comes on top of a spate of tariff threats by Trump that the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday would raise prices and hurt growth without raising enough revenues to cover the rest of his planned tax cuts.\nAs Trump prepares for a second term in the White House, his actions to undo a deal and replace it in under 24 hours test the proposition that markets — a favored Trump barometer of success — will accept his mix of uncertainty and reality TV drama.\nBut from the vantage of Trump world, the economy was already a mess. That's because of inflation, which is currently 2.7%, and public dissatisfaction with Biden.\n“On day one, President Trump will get to work to launch the largest deregulatory agenda in history, cut taxes, and expedite permitting for drilling and fracking to lower energy costs and inflation for all Americans,” said Karoline Leavitt, the transition spokeswoman and incoming press secretary.\nTurbulence already starting\nThe past few days are a reminder that the economic growth in the Republican’s first term was often accompanied by turmoil. It remains to be seen if voters already exhausted by inflation are ready for another round of blame games and uncertainty that the past few days have foreshadowed.\nTrump vowed on social media Wednesday to “fight ’till the end” unless Democrats agreed to lift the debt ceiling as a condition for the short-term funding to keep the federal government open. He and his billionaire friend and adviser Elon Musk also promised to fund challengers in the 2026 primary elections to any Republican lawmaker who opposed the president-elect.\nHis social media postings came after Musk blasted the bipartisan package reached by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to fund the government through March 14. When the government last had a partial shutdown for five weeks starting at the end of 2018, the CBO estimated it cut economic growth by $3 billion, a small but symbolic sum.\nBy Thursday, Trump was claiming on social media that a new deal reached among Republicans was a “SUCCESS” because it would push the debt ceiling out until January 30, 2027. He insisted that Democrats “do what is best for Country,” but the White House and leading Democratic lawmakers came out against the proposal.\nDemocrats were also quick to seize on the seeming Republican dysfunction, with Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., saying, ”Trump’s made a lot of promises, but he’s also going to be accountable for the impact he’s having on families.”\n“I guess Elon Musk is making the decisions now, because Republicans in Congress are incapable of making decisions on their own,\" DelBene said in an interview. \"They just wait for someone to tell them what to do.”\nTrump won the election, but public still wary\nTrump's ability to project strength and assure voters that he would reduce inflation helped him win November's election. Stocks initially climbed on the prospect of tax and regulatory cuts, but Trump still faces a skeptical public and appears to be starting his presidency from a more delicate position than Biden did four years ago.\nMost U.S. adults — 54% — have an unfavorable view of Trump, according to the latest survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey found that small majorities have slight to no confidence in his ability to manage the White House or government spending. By contrast, Biden began his presidency with an approval rating above 60% only to see it steadily decline as inflation worsened.\nIn a sense, Trump has to preserve the momentum of an economy still recovering from pandemic-era distortions while going through a series of tough policy choices. First, there is the need to increase the government's legal borrowing authority that he insists be part of any short-term funding bill in order to avoid a shutdown. He will also push to renew his 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire after next year. On top of that, there is a budget deficit that has become less sustainable with higher interest rates.\n“The U.S. economy is in very good shape — it has a strong underlying growth trend,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. “All of the risks are policy risks. They’re risks that the Fed didn’t get it right, risks that come with the clock — we’ve got to do the debt ceiling, we’ve got to fund the government.”\nIn a speech this month at the Brookings Institution, Biden took stock of the roughly 3% economic growth and the inflation rate easing since its 2022 spike, saying Trump would come into office with a solid economy. But he also warned that the policies of Trump allies in the form of tariffs and deportations could unleash an “economic disaster.”\nThe president never translated his investments in infrastructure, renewable energy and new factories into political momentum. But he said “it’s going to be politically costly and economically unsound for the next president to disrupt or cut” those programs.\nTrump is also inheriting a higher national debt from Biden that could limit the benefits and scope of his planned tax cuts. When he was last president in 2020, the government was spending $345 billion annually to service the debt. That cost now exceeds $1 trillion. On Thursday, the president-elect said on social media that the federal government “will cut Hundreds of Billions of Dollars in spending next year” in an effort to fund his tax cuts and limit deficits.\nThe Fed sees uncertainty ahead\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told reporters at a Wednesday news conference that some members of the central bank's rate-setting committee started to incorporate the possible effects of Trump's policies into their economic forecasts.\nBut Powell stressed that there is a lack of clarity about what Trump would do. It's unknown whether he would deliver on tariff threats against Canada, Mexico, China and Europe. Nor is there much official guidance on how Trump would fund tax cuts that could add $4.6 trillion to deficits over a decade.\n“Some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their writing down more uncertainty around inflation,” Powell said. “The point about uncertainty is it’s kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower.\"\nPowell added for emphasis about what happens with uncertainty: \"It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.”"

        "article_content": "An investor dubbed the “French whale” has sparked fascination with his lavish bets on the outcome of this year’s US presidential election. Fredi9999, as one of his accounts is known, is wagering at least $30 million that Donald Trump will win in the Polymarket prediction market.\nThat’s peanuts compared with what may be the biggest bet of all on the 2024 election, which is what Trump himself stands to gain — or lose. Through his ownership stake in Trump Media and Technology Group, the stakes for Trump amount to at least $4 billion, which is more than all the presidential election bets on Polymarket combined.\nTrump Media, known by its ticker symbol, DJT, is broadly viewed as the one financial asset serving as a binary bet on whether Trump wins or loses the presidential race. If Trump wins, DJT, which houses the Truth Social networking app, could gain a surge of users and revenue, making it a viable social media network able to compete with the likes of X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook. But if Trump loses, DJT’s already weak financials could erode further, threatening the whole business. Some investors think the stock could go to 0, imperiling the company.\nShares of DJT have been wildly volatile during the last two months, surging or crashing based on market perceptions of whether Trump is likely to win. There’s a tight correlation between Trump’s odds in betting markets and the direction of DJT shares.\nIn mid-September, for instance, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris pulled ahead of Trump in betting markets. DJT shares sank and closed September at $12.15, the lowest level since the company went public back in March.\nThen Trump’s election odds improved, hitting 64% in the Real Clear Politics aggregate on Oct. 29. On the same day, DJT closed at $51.51, a 324% gain from its September low. There was no company news during that time indicating any sort of improvement in the company’s financial or operating performance, which is weak.\nDuring the last few days, Trump’s election odds have fallen to around 55%, while DJT shares have slipped to about $31. Polls show the two candidates are essentially tied, with Harris possibly benefiting from a wisp of last-second momentum.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nTrump owns 57% of DJT, and the value of his stake has yoyo-ed in proportion to the stock price and his election odds. In July, before Harris replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, DJT’s market value was around $7.7 billion, putting the value of Trump’s portion at about $4.4 billion. At its low point in September, DJT was worth $2.4 billion, with Trump’s share at $1.4 billion. After the October surge, DJT was worth $10 billion, and Trump’s share $5.7 billion.\nSo from the September bottom to the October top, the value of Trump’s shares varied by $4.3 billion. That’s probably the minimum loss Trump would suffer if he loses the election, because that swing is based on a minimum DJT price of $12.15. If the stock goes to 0, Trump’s losses from peak to trough would be $5.7 billion, the value of his shares as of Oct. 29.\nMany investors have been placing “Trump trades” on assets they think will do better or worse if Trump gets elected, including buying DJT stock outright or buying options that could pay off based on future movements in the stock price. Other Trump trades include cryptocurrency, private prisons, and gold. But it’s hard to imagine any single investor other than Trump could have more than $5 billion riding on the election outcome, making Trump the ultimate election whale.\nTrump would not be losing $5.7 billion that he actually invested in the company. Trump made little or no financial investment in DJT, instead adding to its value through his personal brand and the attention he’s able to bring to its main product, Truth Social. Other investors plowed about $1 billion into the company in its startup phase, however, and they’d lose much of their principal if the stock collapses. If DJT does crater, the company could still operate as a non-public company if somebody bought it or its owners chose to take it private.\nTrump would still take a massive financial hit if he loses the election and DJT craters. In late October, with DJT near its peak, Bloomberg estimated Trump’s net worth to be around $6.6 billion, and most of that was his stake in DJT. Without that stake, Trump’s net worth might be around $1 billion. That’s obviously a lot, but much of his wealth is illiquid, and if defeated, Trump would face heavy claims on his wealth long into the future.\nTrump is already on the hook for an $83.3 million judgment against him in the E. Jean. Carroll defamation case and for $454 million in a New York fraud trial. Those payments are on pause as Trump appeals them. Trump is still entangled in three criminal cases that could drag on for years as legal bills pile up. Two of those cases are federal cases Trump could have dismissed if he wins the White House — but will likely have to keep fighting if he loses. The third is a Fulton County, Ga., case that Trump can’t close down even if he’s president.\nIf Trump loses, he would also endure reputational damage as a 78-year-old two-time presidential loser with no obvious next move. Trump stokes his fame, branding power, and fundraising ability by constantly staying in the news and frequently delighting his followers. If he fades into the background, all of that fades with him. All told, it could mark the greatest financial stake ever in the outcome of a presidential election.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Shares of Trump Media and Technology Group slid in midday trading Friday after President-elect Donald Trump transferred all of his shares into a revocable trust, according to a regulatory filing.\nTrump transferred all of his nearly 115 million shares — worth around $4 billion on paper — in the parent company of social networking site Truth Social as a “bona fide gift” to the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday said. Trump's shares amount to more than half of the company's stock.\nIt's not clear why Trump transferred the stock. Donald Trump Jr. is the sole trustee and has sole voting and investment power over all securities owned by the trust.\nTrump Media shares were down about 2% at midday, to $34.68 each. At one point Friday, they were down around 6%.\nTrump Media shares have been extremely volatile since the company began trading in March. They reached intraday highs close to $80 on the first day of trading, then slumped to all-time lows in September when Trump and other insiders were finally allowed to sell shares after standard lock-up agreements expired. Trump has not sold any shares in the company.\nThe company's stock price has fluctuated wildly on news — good and bad — related to Trump. They tumbled after Trump's conviction in a hush money trial in May, then surged after the first assassination attempt on Trump in July. They surged again after he won re-election in November, even as the company reported a $19.2 million third-quarter loss.\nTrump created Trump Media after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot."

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump has sent mixed signals for years on whether he would aim to fire or demote Fed Chair Jerome Powell when he reenters the Oval Office next year.\nBut Powell himself laid down a marker Thursday that he won’t be going anywhere, even if Trump tried.\n\"Not permitted under the law,\" the central bank chair said Thursday in curt but clear responses to reporters who asked about his views on any legal authorities Trump might have in terms of firing or demoting him or any other top Fed officials.\n\"No,\" he said at another point in a press conference on the question of whether he would leave.\nIt could be a point of conflict in the months ahead. Trump has signaled he may not be inclined to fire Powell but has also maintained he has that power.\nFor his part, Trump reiterated the idea of firing Powell in a 2020 news conference when he bluntly said, \"I have the right to remove\" Powell.\nHe added that he could also demote Powell from his position as chair, \"put him in a regular position, and put somebody else in charge.\"\nIt’s an unsettled legal question, though, with many experts falling on Powell's side of the argument.\nAt issue is Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act. The law states that each member of the board shall hold office for 14 years \"unless sooner removed for cause by the President.\" The statute doesn't have any language that specifically addresses the chairman of the Board of Governors.\nRead more: How much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates?\nThe question that has been debated for years is what exactly constitutes \"for cause.\"\nThe language in the law is plainly more restrictive for Fed officials when compared with the arrangements of cabinet officials and other members of a presidential administration, who are often described as working \"at the pleasure\" of the president.\nLegal experts have tended to say that a simple policy disagreement wouldn't rise to the level of cause, but it's a standard that hasn't been tested with a judge.\nThe comments from Powell and the legal questions come amid massive uncertainty for the central bank following the decisive win for Trump on Tuesday night.\nDuring his first term, then-President Trump attacked Powell with regularity (even though it was Trump who had elevated him to his current role) and openly pushed for the actions he wanted, even once suggesting negative interest rates.\nEsther George, the former president of the Kansas City Fed, also weighed in on possible implications of a Trump presidency in a Yahoo Finance interview on Thursday afternoon.\n\"It could be unsettling to markets,\" she said about Trump possibly meddling in monetary policy.\nShe added that the years ahead \"will require the Fed to stand up to pressures that it may receive, whether they're simply rhetoric or they are more direct threats. But I think the Fed is well prepared and able to focus on where its mandate lands.\"\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has sent decidedly mixed signals about how far he might go to upend central bank independence.\nHe has talked for years about what he sees as his authority to fire Powell but he’s also downplayed the notion this summer \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"\nThat’s a message that appears to be continuing, with CNN reporting Thursday that a senior adviser to the president-elect said he would be likely to \"allow\" Powell to serve the remainder of his term.\nIn any case, Trump is now set to choose Powell’s replacement eventually when his term as chair ends in May 2026. Trump has been clear that no third term will be in the offing.\nMost of the names include figures who have surrounded Trump for years on economic policy — from former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, who was on the shortlist last time, to Kevin Hassett, who worked in the White House as a senior adviser to Trump.\nOn Thursday Powell dispatched with the repeated political questions quickly and tried to keep the focus on news of another rate cut.\nHe also said Thursday that the Fed would be making no immediate changes to monetary policy ahead of possible policy changes coming under Trump.\n\"I’m not going to get into any of the political things here today,\" he said when another reporter tried to get into political topics.\nThis post has been updated with additional context.\nBen Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how US policy and government affect your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "article_content": "Jerome Powell made it very clear last week that he didn’t think Donald Trump had the power to fire him, even if he wanted to.\nBut there was one aspect of Trump’s return to the White House that he was willing to leave as a mystery: How Trump’s proposed economic policies might affect the Fed’s expectations for a series of additional rate cuts in 2025.\n“There is nothing to model right now,” Powell told reporters last Thursday after the Fed announced its second rate cut in seven weeks.\nEconomists say Trump’s combination of proposed across-the-board tariffs, tax cuts, and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants would put new pressure on inflation and balloon the deficit, all of which will make it more challenging for the Fed to cut rates.\nA surge in Treasury yields that followed Trump’s election last week could also cause complications if it continues into next year.\nMany economists are already scaling back their expectations for the number and pace of rate cuts next year on account of these proposed policies from a new Trump administration.\nOne is David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura. He now expects just one rate cut in 2025, with the Fed pausing rate cuts until any inflation shock from tariffs has passed. He predicts the new tariffs will lead to a \"significant near-term boost\" to inflation.\nCapital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth also now sees rates staying 50 basis points higher than previously forecast, with the Fed ending its rate-cutting campaign in the range of 3.5%-3.75%.\n\"The combined drag from immigration curbs and new tariffs mean that, in net terms, Trump’s return is likely to be a negative for the economy,\" he said.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nPowell last week repeatedly refused to engage in a discussion about what Trump’s proposals might mean for the Fed’s current expectations of four more quarter-point rate cuts in 2025.\n\"We don't know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be,\" Powell said Thursday. \"We therefore don't know what the effects on the economy would be, specifically whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.\"\nHe said Thursday that the Fed is in no hurry to \"quickly\" get to neutral, a level where rates don’t slow or spur inflation, but he did admit that the Fed is \"beginning to think about\" slowing the pace of cuts.\n\"We reach a point where we slow the pace, much like [how] an airplane reaching the airport slows down,\" he said.\nHe declined to say what might happen at the Fed’s last 2024 meeting in December, saying, \"We’re just going to have to see where the data led us. We have a whole six weeks of data to look at.\"\nInvestors may have to wait until that meeting for new hints as to how Powell and his colleagues are viewing the conditions they will have to confront next year. Fed officials plans to offer fresh estimates for rate cuts, inflation, and the strength of the economy through 2025 and beyond.\nJPMorgan chief economist Michael Feroli said the election outcome \"may have lowered the odds of a cut [in December] by a wee amount, as the appreciation in risk assets could be a factor in the discussion.\"\nAfter December, he now sees the Fed easing at a quarterly pace, with the next cut coming in March and continuing until the fed funds rate reaches 3.5%.\nThis is not the first time the Fed has grappled with the impact of Trump's policies. It was in the same place during its last meeting in December 2016, after Trump had been elected but before he took over as president.\nAnticipated changes to fiscal policies under a new administration did come up at that December 2016 meeting, according to Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank Securities.\nFed staff built into its forecast an assumption of a 1% tax cut and a shift in fiscal policies that boosted the staff's assumption for the neutral interest rate by 25 basis points, according to minutes and transcripts from that meeting.\nIn fact, minutes from that meeting showed that \"about half\" of officials reflected changes to fiscal policies in their baseline outlooks but that \"almost all\" noted these policies shifted the distribution of risks toward stronger growth outcomes.\n\"Many\" saw them as \"potentially necessitating somewhat tighter monetary policy than currently anticipated.\"\nNot all economists predict immediate changes from Trump’s policies. Greg Daco, chief economist for EY, isn’t anticipating any major effect from Trump’s proposed trade and tax policies until late 2025 and believes near-term consequences are minimal.\nA lot of potential shocks for the economy depend on the magnitude of policy shifts, he said.\nIf the new administration moves forward with blanket tariffs on all trading partners and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports, then he sees a more dramatic impact, with GDP plunging by 2.5% and inflation soaring by 1.5%.\nRead more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them?\nUnder that scenario, the changes would represent an average income loss of $1,145 per household, with lower-income families disproportionately affected.\nDaco — factoring in the changes to immigration, regulation, trade, and tax policy — sees economic growth dropping to 2% next year from 2.7% this year, before easing to 1.7% in 2026. He sees inflation easing to 2.3% in 2025 and 2026.\nBut he, like others, anticipates fewer rate cuts at a slower pace, with the Fed cutting at every other meeting in 2025. He expects a total of 100 basis points of reductions, versus expectations for 150 basis points previously.\n“What we're doing is not necessarily integrating every single campaign promise,\" he said in an interview, \"but rather building a new baseline that seems likely and integrates partial tariffs that are targeted and more transactional against certain economies, against certain sectors.\"\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-11-03T13:39:15.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump is suffering an historic descent in the campaign's final days, an ongoing freefall that's turning what looked like a walkaway for the former president into what's most likely a Kamala Harris victory. That's the view from Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, whose proprietary model's proven right-on in past elections.\nTrump's darkening prospects mark a dramatic reversal from the election's dynamic less than 13 days ago. During the first three weeks of October, Donald Trump staged a remarkable comeback, rebounding from a huge deficit to a commanding lead. With less than two weeks to go before Election Day, Trump appeared en route to a smashing victory.\nHarris countered the Trump surge by pivoting from an attack on Trump's policies to spotlighting his \"unstable\" personality and the \"obsession with revenge.\" That message failed to resonate with voters as Trump moved relentlessly upwards in the electoral vote count, as forecast by the Miller framework. By contrast, Trump was tapping a powerful undercurrent: The deeply unpopular Biden record, especially on the economy.\n\"The macro numbers on growth, and employment look good, and the Democrats keep touting them,\" says Miller. \"But people don't care about GDP or the national jobless rate. They care that they're paying so much more for groceries than four years ago, that they can't afford to buy a first home because mortgage rates are so high, or afford a car loan to replace the beat-up model in the driveway, or that they have no savings and need to work two jobs to get by.\"\nIn other words, although Harris stresses that the stats look fine, people don't feel fine due to the dollar squeeze in their own lives. Plus, Americans are fretting more and more about this nation's involvement in foreign wars. The Biden administration's policy of sending arms to Israel for bolstering its forces in the war versus Iran, and to Ukraine for fortifying its campaign to defeat the the Russian invasion is deeply troubling to a large swath of the electorate—especially since it's unclear how long those conflicts, and hence our involvement, will last. Trump, on the other hand, has been striking a quasi-isolationist stance on the stump that seems to be finding favor on the trail.\nPut simply, Americans are pissed at where Biden's led the U.S., and by extension, at Harris.\nTime was so short, Miller concluded, that Harris was unlikely to significantly close the yawning divide by taking new policy positions, shifting her campaign rhetoric, or even upping her ground game. \"My view was that only a major shock could change the course of the race,\" he says, \"meaning an earthquake that hugely benefited Democratic ticket.\"\nThe earthquake happened. It wasn't ignited by the Harris camp, but an unforced error by the Trump team. The event that transformed the election was billed as the capstone to a movement bound for glory: The Oct. 27 rally at Madison Square Garden, in the heart of Trump's home city of New York, before rowdy audience of 20,000.\nThe spectacle boasted around three-dozen speakers, but few top politicians and no widely-respected statesmen. They divided mainly between highly controversial Trump loyalists who embodied—and from the podium, championed—the candidate's most extreme views, and marquee names from the worlds of entertainment and right-wing media.\nThe cast encompassed such divisive figures as disgraced former New York Mayor and onetime Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was disbarred and suffered a $148 million judgment that forced him into bankruptcy for falsely claiming that Georgia officials tried to rig the 2020 election; Stephen Miller, Trump's former White House advisor who advocates draconian measures to curb immigration; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the gadfly Trump has promised to install in a top position if he wins, and whose radical environmental views contradict the former president's; and Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire given to outrageous tweeting in his self-owned platform X.\nAlso onstage were Tucker Carlson, fired from his perch as a Fox News host for promoting unfounded conspiracy theories, and Hulk Hogan, who in full wrestling regalia mounted a chest-pounding performance that drew roars from the crowd he dubbed \"Trump-o-maniacs.\"\nThe speeches unleashed shockwaves just when Trump needed to stay smoothly on course. The most infamous gaffe: insult comedian Tony Hinchcliffe calling Puerto Rico \"a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean,\" followed by his howler that Latinos \"love making babies.\" Businessman Grant Cardone's charge that \"Harris and her pimp handlers will destroy the country\" amplified the negative messaging. During his address, Trump himself kept the roast going, characterizing his opponent as \"a low IQ individual.\"\nAccording to Miller, the gathering that Trump called a \"love fest\" seems to have spread not unity and inclusion, but hostility—especially to women. None other than Nikki Haley, Trump's leading female rival for the nomination, expressed that view in an Oct. 29 interview for Fox News.\n\"This campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes or whether she's dumb,\" intoned Haley. \"Your target market is suburban women who are college educated. This bromance thing, this masculinity stuff [on display at MSG] it borders on edgy to the point where it's going to make women uncomfortable. Fifty-three percent of the electorate are women. They care about the issues and how they're being talked to. There was no reason to have a comedian at the event,\" where the swipe at Puerto Rico proved \"harmful\" to the Trump-Vance ticket.\nIn the days that followed, while the Dems paraded the Hinchcliff disaster in the media, Trump advocates kept the bad vibes coming. A super PAC launched by Musk shared a video on X that that used vulgar wordplay to demean the vice president. Then in a Carlson interview that aired on Nov. 1, Trump denounced former Congresswoman and long-time foe Liz Cheney as a warmonger, and suggested she be sent into battle, proving she's a coward and hypocrite.\n\"Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?\" stated the GOP standardbearer. \"Let's see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\"\nMiller bases his model not on the polls or opinions of the pundits, but on the prediction or betting markets. His main data source are the prices posted on what he deems the most trustworthy, and highly liquid, political wagering platform PredictIt. Miller applies his own methodology to the PredictIt odds, and translates the result into the share of electoral college votes that each candidate commands at any given moment. Miller updates the counts every minute, and you can follow the race, practically in real-time, on his site Virtualtout.io.\nThis writer first followed Miller's methods in the 2020 election, and was impressed by the discipline of his approach and his accuracy in gauging results for both the presidential contest, and the two Senate seat runoffs in Georgia that secured control of the upper chamber for the Democrats.\nMiller's numbers show a jaw-dropping swing to Harris that would have seemed unimaginable two weeks ago. On Oct. 26, Trump tallied 367 electoral votes to just 171 for Harris, putting the GOP nominee 196 in front. The next day, Trump headed his blowout at MSG, and no sooner did the giant screens go blank than he started losing ground. On Monday, Harris gained 18 electoral votes, and she kept improving every day through midnight on Thursday. By then, Harris had gained 58. Trump's lead shrank by over half from 196 to 80.\nThe drop accelerated from there. On Friday, Trump's horde fell by an extraordinary 39 electoral votes, lowering his total to 270 (the number needed to win), against 268 for Harris. By 10 a.m. on Saturday, Trump had shed another 5, putting Harris in the lead by by 273 to 265. All told, in the seven days since Trump peaked on Oct. 25, he's lost 102 electoral votes. According to the Miller model, what looked like an invincible lead collapsed in a week.\nWhere does the race stand now, according to Miller?\n\"It's been going back and forth around the 270 line,\" he told Fortune. \"Right now, it's a tossup according to the PredictIt numbers. The big question in my mind is, how much Republican bias is there in the prediction markets?\"\nMiller notes that he assessed the GOP tilt in the 2020 races for PredictIt, and made the right adjustments for it, as evidenced by the accuracy of his forecasts. For the 2024 election, he's using the same correction methodology he deployed four years ago. But now, though he hasn't put precise numbers on the difference, Miller reckons that the betting sites lean more strongly to the GOP than in 2020.\n\"It's my experience working studying prediction markets in the past that lead to that conclusion,\" observes Miller. \"I believe all of the prediction markets are more biased to Republicans than in 2020.\"\nThe sites overestimate the GOP odds, he says, in part because the betters are mainly males who often also wager on sports, and love taking risks. He adds that Musk's lavish praise for prediction markets may have pushed the scales further in the Trump-Vance direction, noting that a few Trump \"whales\" could be inflating his odds of victory on some markets that allow individuals to wager unlimited sums.\nA main reason he uses PredicitIt, Miller avows, is that the site imposes a relatively low limit on the dollars any single gambler can place on a candidate. Hence, the platform can't be swayed by rich Trump fans. Miller reckons that PredictIt's prices are less exaggerated than the odds on competing sites, but his preferred platform still tips more Republican than 2020. As a result, he says, his model's electoral vote count could be understating Harris's newfound advantage.\n\"Her edge is probably higher than the handful of votes shown on the continuous feed for virtualtout.io,\" he says. \"It's just impossible to completely correct for the tilt. Even though it looks like a tossup by the Virtualtout numbers, I'm anticipating a Harris-Walz victory.\"\nIt was just a week ago that Miller's forecast picked Trump as the probable winner. In addition to the expected Republican bias in the prediction markets, the direction towards Harris, says Miller, is consistent with a \"fundamental\" in calling the outcome. \"Candidates usually win by moving to the center, and Harris has claimed the center. Trump's just kept going more and more to the extremes,\" he says.\nMiller also notes that his real time \"ticker tape,\" which he calls \"tinyticker,\" shows the impact of campaign events instantaneously, whereas the polls capture these changes, and often inaccurately, only after four or five days. His system caught this sudden, massive transition just when it began, and has been tracking its trajectory minute by minute since.\nTime looked too short for Harris to rebound, yet it happened. Now, the question is whether in a span of three days, the former president can reverse a trend that he himself set in motion, on one of the world's biggest stages, in a belly flop heard coast to coast.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "US banks have a lot riding on the outcome of Election Day even if they’re not 100% sure how either candidate might treat their industry.\nThe \"knee-jerk reaction,\" according to KBW analyst Chris McGratty, is that a Donald Trump victory will mean a return to looser regulation of banks and more leniency in approving the sort of corporate mergers that produce big profits for Wall Street giants.\nA Kamala Harris win, on the other hand, may mean that a more aggressive period of overseeing the nation’s largest financial institutions under President Joe Biden will continue.\n\"In my investor conversations, it definitely feels like people are pricing in Trump,\" McGratty told Yahoo Finance. \"So initially, if the election goes to Harris I would think banks would sell off,\" he added.\nThe country’s largest lenders have had a great year thanks to the economy's resilience during a period of elevated interest rates and a rebound in their investment banking and trading operations. The hope is next year could also turn out well, if lending and Wall Street dealmaking churn higher while interest rates fall.\nAn index tracking 24 of the largest domestically chartered US commercial banks (^BKX) is up 27% so far this year, outperforming the broader financial sector and major stock indexes.\nThose other indexes for the financial sector (XLF), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), S&P 500 (^GSPC) are up 24%, 21% and 20%, respectively.\nThe consensus among industry observers is that a Trump White House might be more favorable for a run-up in financial stocks. After all, bank stocks rose 20% in the three months after Trump was elected in 2016.\nBut the challenge for bank executives as they assess the impact of a new president is that neither Trump nor Harris have said much about how they want Washington to oversee the biggest banks in the US.\nSo, instead, their track records have largely spoken for them.\nThe Trump administration of last decade delivered a big corporate tax cut, and it also rolled back some big bank rules that were imposed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\nHarris, on the other hand, has touted her clash with big banks when she was California’s attorney general as an example of her willingness to take on powerful interests.\nRead more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts\nOne big unknown is what either administration would do with a new set of controversial capital rules proposed by top bank regulators that would require lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses.\nThe requirements are based on an international set of capital requirements known as Basel III imposed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis.\nBanks have been fighting this US proposal for the last year in an aggressive public campaign and even dropped hints about suing regulators if they don’t get their way.\nThey won a big victory in September when some regulators said they would water down those requirements. But not all regulators appear to be on board with that plan, putting the final version in doubt.\nSome in the industry expect regulators to scrap the proposal if Trump wins.\n\"If you're looking at how Trump views the world, I think you see less cooperation with international standard setters,\" Allen Puwalski, chief investment officer at Cybiont Capital, told Yahoo Finance.\n“And I think you see the US back out of Basel III.”\nAnd a Harris win means the proposal for bank capital increases likely won't \"change that much,\" according to Ian Katz, a managing director at Capital Alpha Partners.\n\"If Harris wins, I expect regulators to sit down to reassess the proposal and try to move forward,\" he added.\nBut Katz is also quick to point out that even in a Trump win, a more friendly regulatory climate for the biggest lenders can't be assured, and it certainly won't be touted.\n\"You can't assume that every Republican these days is going to do favors for the largest banks,\" he added.\nKBW predicts that on day one a Trump administration could make as much as eight leadership changes at federal regulatory agencies that oversee different corners of the financial services industry.\nThat includes the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Securities and Exchange Commission, and potentially even the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if Biden nominee Christy Goldsmith Romero isn't confirmed by the end of the year.\nNew leaders would also take over the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which would likely make it easier for giant companies to merge without running afoul of antitrust concerns.\nKBW expects significant change at the Federal Reserve in 2026, when the chairmanship of the Fed’s Jerome Powell ends.\nWhat is perhaps even more relevant for the banking industry is that 2026 is also the end of a term for Michael Barr as vice chair of supervision. Barr is the architect of the new bank capital rules and one of the industry's chief antagonists.\nThe Washington Post has reported that bank executives and former Fed officials expect Trump to demote Barr, who was a Joe Biden appointee and a Treasury official during the Barack Obama era.\nIt is not known if Trump would have the legal power to make such a move, the Post reported.\nSome big bank executives are clearly not fans of the current Biden-era regulators.\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon this past week called a raft of regulatory proposals from his overseers \"an onslaught,\" criticized CFPB director Rohit Chopra, and made it clear the industry is willing to push back on new rules in court.\n\"It's time to fight back,\" Dimon said while speaking at an American Bankers Association convention in New York City. \"I've had it with this sh*t.\"\n\"We don't want to get involved in litigation just to make a point,\" he added, \"but I think if you're in a knife fight, you'd better damn well bring a knife.\"\nNo matter which candidate takes the country’s top job, some bankers are convinced that the election will not define an industry full of institutions that have endured at least a century of change.\n\"We’ve done this through World Wars, money panics, depressions, the Texas meltdown of the 80s, great financial crisis, and COVID,” Phil Green, CEO of San Antonio-based Frost Bank, told Yahoo Finance. Frost is 156 years old.\n\"We're kind of like cockroaches in that way,\" he added. \"We're going to still be here — at least that's our plan.\"\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Presidents can move entire markets with a single sentence. Donald Trump, a former president, sent a single stock soaring with just three words: “I’m not selling,” he pronounced at a press conference on Sept. 13, when asked whether he would offload the millions of shares he owns in his social media company. Buoyed by this declaration of faith from its largest shareholder, the stock shot up 27% to $20.76, before closing the day at $17.97.\nLater this month, for the first time since Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG)—which owns Truth Social—went public, Trump will be allowed to sell his shares in the company. As the former chair of TMTG and a major insider, Trump is subject to a “lockup” provision that prevents insiders from selling stock in the newly public company before a certain date.\nThe lockup period for Trump, who owns about 57% of TMTG and is its largest stakeholder, will expire on Sept. 25 at the latest. If TMTG’s stock remains above $12, the lockup could end as early as Thursday, Sept. 19—a feat that looks increasingly likely. The price hasn’t dropped below $15 on any trading day since Aug. 22.\nTrump currently owns 114.5 million shares of TMTG (ticker symbol: DJT), which are worth about $1.85 billion.\nTrump’s stake in TMTG is likely a significant portion of his wealth. Forbes estimates Trump’s net worth to be about $3.7 billion, meaning the paper value of his TMTG shares would account for about 50% of his total wealth. Of course, as with anyone whose wealth is tied up in company stock, Trump’s net worth can fluctuate regularly with changes in the share price.\nFortune’s series on Trump Media & Technology Group\nThe company building Trump Media’s tech has historic links to Iran, Russia, and China\nTrump’s $8 billion media company creates a complex set of potential conflicts for the incoming president\nReal America’s Voice: How a tiny pro-Trump news network founded by a convicted criminal got so close to the president\nTrump Media is quietly storing at least one of its data centers in a facility owned by a longtime Republican donor and media mogul\nTrump Media lockup deadline leaves Trump with a choice: trigger a fire sale or hold a meme stock\nAs the lockup expiry date approaches, Fortune looked through dozens of SEC disclosures to examine the condition of TMTG. We found a company with a market cap of $3.1 billion—an almost inexplicable valuation given that the underlying enterprise is no larger than the size of a small family business. It has declining revenues, no profits, and is embroiled in multiple lawsuits. The company even confesses it made material misstatements in its financials reporting with no clear timeline of when it will be able to remedy them.\nAnd—crucially for the company and anyone holding its shares—its future is largely tied up with the decisions of its largest individual shareholder: Donald Trump. The filings acknowledge Trump’s personal financial interests may hurt his investors because he has a right to vote his shares in ways that “may not always be in the interests of the Combined Entity’s stockholders generally.”\nInsiders at newly public companies approaching the end of a lockup period will often communicate with the board to devise a plan to sell their stake incrementally over time and avoid a free-for-all in the market, according to Michael Ewens, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. “Everyone realizes selling it all is bad,” he says. “There’s a good reason for that; they don’t want the share price to tank.”\nIf insiders, especially Trump, rushed to offload as many shares as possible when the lockup period ended it would trigger a fire sale. Shareholders, many of whom are retail investors who bought the stock as a show of support for Trump, could see their investments greatly devalued or wiped out. But, as the largest shareholder of the company, no one would have more to lose from a cratering TMTG share price than Trump. The ensuing price drop could make whatever shares he wasn’t able to sell almost worthless, according to Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida Warrington College of Business who studies public offerings.\nBut holding on to TMTG stock poses its own set of risks, namely that its share price appears entirely divorced from its underlying business results, trading mostly on the fervent devotion Trump inspires in his followers rather than any market fundamentals. That means Trump, as by far the largest shareholder, is caught between a rock and hard place. He can flood the market with shares knowing that whatever he doesn’t manage to sell will be worth a fraction of their original value. Or he can hold on to them and face the daunting prospect of turning TMTG and Truth Social into a genuine tech and media business.\nThus far, TMTG’s financial performance has been modest.\nThe company made revenues of just $1.6 million in the first half of 2024, a decline of 30% from the year before. It posted a net loss of $344 million for the period, as total costs rose 1,104% from $9.8 million to $118.5 million, according to TMTG’s latest quarterly earnings report.\nTo shore up its finances, TMTG struck a deal on July 3 to sell up to $2.5 billion worth of stock to Yorkville Advisors, a New Jersey investment firm that works with small- and micro-cap companies. The deal, a “standby equity purchase agreement,” is common among new companies. Essentially, it gives TMTG a guaranteed buyer if it issues new shares and a means to put cash on its balance sheet, while Yorkville gets the right to purchase discounted stock. In this case, Yorkville will pay 97.25% of the share price, which it can then turn around and sell at full price on the open market. Over the three-year term of the deal, TMTG will have sole discretion over when to issue shares that Yorkville can purchase, according to the agreement.\nThe deal limits Yorkville to 19.99% of TMTG’s outstanding shares, which as of July—when the deal was signed—was 37 million shares, worth $680 million. TMTG can also request advances. And the deal isn’t exclusive, meaning TMTG can still raise capital from other sources. In striking the deal, TMTG paid Yorkville a $25,000 structuring fee and issued 200,000 shares to Yorkville, currently worth $3.9 million, as a commitment fee.\n“I see no reason why Yorkville would not want to immediately resell the shares, rather than expose itself to the risk of a stock price decline,” Ritter said. “Yorkville appears to be in a situation in which it can make some money as a middleman without exposing itself to much risk.”\nWhile an equity purchase agreement isn’t unusual for a newly public company, its choice of investor does raise questions, according to Francine McKenna, a former public accountant at KPMG and PwC. Among them: “who those people are, who is part of that deal, who's part of that insider group?,” McKenna said. “And in this case, you have Yorkville Advisors as part of the insider group. I would say they're not Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs.”\nIn the past, Yorkville’s founder and president Mark Angelo had run-ins with regulators in Italy and Switzerland, according to disclosures made to the SEC. In 2015, Angelo and Yorkville Advisors were fined $135,000 by the Italian financial regulator the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa for failing to make a public tender offer to buy the shares of certain shareholders involved in a deal. In 2022, Yorkville settled with the Swiss Federal Department of Finance for $82,515 over claims it didn’t properly disclose derivative holdings in three Swiss-listed companies.\nA spokesperson for Yorkville Advisors declined to comment on the equity purchase agreement with TMTG, saying it “does not respond to inquiries from the press with respect to its business transactions.” The spokesperson described the fine from Italian regulators as a “technical violation in reliance on advice provided by Yorkville’s outside Italian counsel.” Yorkville did not respond to follow-up questions from Fortune about the settlement with Swiss regulators.\nFortune also sent TMTG a detailed set of questions regarding the statements made in its SEC filings, its financing deal with Yorkville Advisors, whether company insiders and the board had discussed plans regarding the end of the lockup period, and the company’s overall strategy. The company responded by questioning Fortune’s journalistic methods:\n“By cherrypicking statements from our filings while omitting all countervailing information, and touting quotes from supposed experts who just happen to support all the reporter's biases, Fortune offers a great lesson in how to manufacture fake news,” the spokesperson said.\nTMTG was founded shortly after Trump left the White House in 2021. Two former contestants on The Apprentice, Wesley Moss and Andrew Litinsky, approached Trump with the idea to start their own social media site since he had recently been banned from mainstream platforms in the wake of Jan. 6.\nMoss and Litinisky secured Trump’s approval to use his brand to bolster Truth Social, their nascent, conservative alternative to X (formerly Twitter). In return, a company they set up, United Atlantic Ventures (UAV), received an 8.6% equity stake in TMTG. In October 2021, TMTG agreed to go public via a “special purpose acquisition company” (SPAC) called Digital World Acquisition (DWAC), helmed by Florida investor Patrick Orlando.\nTMTG wouldn’t end up going public until March 2024 after the deal got tied up in an SEC investigation. The SEC eventually alleged in an ongoing lawsuit that Orlando made material misrepresentations on disclosure forms when he said he didn’t have any intended acquisition targets, despite having already held “numerous lengthy discussions” with TMTG representatives. SPACs are generally not allowed to pre-coordinate with other companies.\n“The lawsuits that were surrounding various parts of [the SPAC deal], and the SEC investigation slowing it down for so long, was unusual,” said Usha Rodrigues, a professor of corporate finance and securities law at the University of Georgia Law School, and an expert in SPACs. SPACs are “supposed to be blank-check companies where you really don't have an intended target at the outset,” she said.\nEarlier this month the judge in the case, Christopher R. Cooper of the U.S. District Court of D.C., granted Orlando’s lawyers’ request for a 30-day extension to respond to the SEC’s initial complaint.\nOrlando did not respond to a request for comment sent via LinkedIn and multiple emails sent to his lawyers.\nThose weren’t the only legal disputes plaguing TMTG. In February, Litinsky and Moss sued TMTG for allegedly withholding their 8.6% stake in the company by attempting to dilute their equity by issuing one billion new shares, including 900 million that would be designated as voting stock, according to the lawsuit. Doing so, Litinsky and Moss allege, was against the conditions of their original contract with Trump and TMTG (then called Trump Media Group Corp.), which granted them the right to approve both the issuance of new shares and the creation of any new classes of stock.\nIn response TMTG sued Litinsky and Moss’s company UAV a month later, claiming it was justified in doing so because the pair botched the company’s public offering, leading to a years-long delay. The two “failed spectacularly at every turn,” the suit alleges. In September the two won a separate case and the right to sell their shares on the open market. (Lawyers for Litinsky and Moss did not respond to multiple requests for comment).\nAll companies are required by law to disclose possible risks to their business, even risks that seem remote. Most companies’ risks revolve around competitive or regulatory threats to their business models. But the risks at TMTG are unusual because they are tied to the popularity of one man.\nThe company’s management acknowledged in an SEC filing that Trump’s personal legal issues—one of which resulted in 34 felony convictions that Trump is currently appealing—leaves the company’s future hanging in the balance. The outcome of any one of the at least seven different criminal and civil court cases involving Trump could determine the success of a company with already precarious finances. While TMTG is not involved in any of these cases, the company says it “cannot predict” what effects “an adverse outcome” might have on Trump’s personal reputation and therefore its business, according to the same SEC filing.\nIn its discussion of the risks Trump’s legal troubles pose, TMTG cited a 2016 USA Today article that found the former president and his various businesses had been involved in roughly 3,500 lawsuits over 30 years. Trump had been a plaintiff in 1,900 of those cases, a defendant in 1,450, and in 150 he had either been a third party or involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.\nIn fact, throughout its official documents TMTG admits that much of its future hinges on Trump and Trump alone. TMTG cites Trump extensively as one of its risk factors, citing the possibility that the company’s fate is tied to his political fortunes, according to the SEC filings.\n“Success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump,” one document reads. “The value of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Trump were to suffer.”\nShould the focus of TMTG’s majority shareholder and pitchman waver, the company’s fortunes might falter. “If President Donald J. Trump were to cease to be able to devote substantial time to Truth Social, TMTG’s business would be adversely affected,” the SEC filings say.\nTMTG also highlights Trump’s history of bankruptcies. TMTG is hardly the first venture to carry the Trump name, which can still be found on buildings across the world. Between 1991 and 1992 Trump’s Atlantic City casinos—the Trump Taj Mahal, the Trump Castle, and the Trump Plaza—all filed for bankruptcy.\nBusinesses that carried the Trump name via a licensing deal didn’t fare much better. Trump Steaks discontinued sales after just two months, Trump Mortgage, and Go.Trump.com—a Trump-branded travel site—were both founded in 2006 and shuttered by 2007.\nAnother of Trump’s online companies, Trump University, closed in 2011 amid a series of lawsuits that alleged students were deceived by false advertisements. In 2018, a federal court approved a $25 million settlement against Trump University.\nOf each of those businesses, TMTG said “there can be no guarantee that TMTG’s performance will exceed the performance of those entities,” according to SEC filings.\nWhile dealing with the external threats posed by its numerous legal proceedings, TMTG is also grappling with an internal problem, one that officers of the company acknowledged they are struggling to rectify: properly accounting for TMTG’s finances. Any issues with a public company’s bookkeeping, referred to as “material weaknesses,” pose serious problems to investors, who rely on financial information being accurate.\nWhen TMTG went public earlier this year executives realized the company did not have sufficient qualified personnel to meet the SEC’s reporting standards, according to an SEC filing made about two months after it went public. TMTG is currently trying to fix that. “These remediation measures will be time consuming, incur significant costs, and place significant demands on our financial and operational resources,” the same disclosure says.\nSuch issues are more common in startups and newly public companies because those types of firms have fewer resources and are not as experienced operating under SEC guidelines, according to Jason Schloetzer, an accounting professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. “These weaknesses can lead to reduced investor confidence, increased regulatory scrutiny, and governance challenges, such as inadequate board oversight of the financial reporting process,” Schloetzer said.\nIt is not unusual for a company’s stock price to race ahead of reality. Lots of companies have over-inflated stock prices. This year, for instance, Big Tech stocks hit new highs based on the mostly unrealized promise that artificial intelligence will usher in a new age of productivity. But there is a difference between that type of hype—which is based on businesses that have underlying sales growth—and the situation at TMTG, where revenues are declining and losses are worsening.\nThe extensive risks outlined in TMTG’s own documents, combined with its sagging financial performance, raise questions about whether its current trading price is sustainable. The most common explanation is that TMTG is a meme stock, whose performance is based on the excitement of retail investors rather than sound fundamentals.\n“A meme stock is almost by definition, not tied to economic realities,” said Rodrigues, the SPAC expert. “They trade on momentum, emotion, and rumor.”\nIn the case of TMTG the stock moves on news of its majority shareholder—Trump, according to Ritter, the UF professor and IPO researcher. “Meme stocks thrive on attention, so the stock might jump if there is news about the company or Donald Trump, even if the news is not necessarily good news,” he said.\nAs the stock moves with Trump’s news coverage, favorable or not, TMTG’s outlook remains a head-scratcher. TMTG’s current market price of $16.14 per share is grossly overinflated, roughly 90% higher than its fair market value of $1.50 it should be trading at if one were to look at the company’s cash per share, according to Ritter. By Ritter’s calculations, for TMTG to live up to the $4 billion valuation currently implied by its stock price it would have to generate sustainable earnings of $200 million a year. But TMTG’s current financial performance is far off that mark and there’s “no evidence” the company has a plan to start pulling in annual profits at those levels, according to Ritter.\n“The only bull case for the stock that I can think of is the greater fool theory of investing: you can make money by buying an overvalued stock if you can find an even greater fool who is willing to buy it from you at an even more-inflated price,” Ritter said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "The average inflation rate when Donald Trump was president was 1.9%. During Joe Biden’s presidency, inflation has averaged 5.4%. Many voters think of Biden as the inflation guy.\nYet some prominent investors think future inflation will be worse if Trump wins the 2024 election than if Biden wins. In a June 18 analysis, Goldman Sachs argued that investors should buy gold if they’re worried about the inflationary impact of Trump’s economic agenda, should he become president.\n“We see value in long gold positions as an inflation hedge from geopolitical shock including tariffs, Fed subordination risk, and debt fears,” Goldman analysts wrote. While they didn't identify that as the Trump agenda, those three potential shocks are a clear reference to economic policies Trump has been floating.\nTrump wants to impose a new 60% tariff on all imports from China and a 10% tariff on all other imports. Since tariffs are taxes paid by Americans, that would raise a typical family’s costs by $1,700 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Shoppers would be spending more for the same stuff, which is basically what inflation is.\nTrump also thinks the White House should have more control over the Federal Reserve, a prospect that would alarm financial markets if it ever happened. The Fed has a tough enough job as it is trying to keep inflation and employment at optimal levels, and political interference from the White House could make that a lot harder.\nTrump in particular has pressed the Fed to lower interest rates, even though the standard playbook for bringing down inflation is raising rates to slow the economy. If Trump won a second term and tried to force his own agenda on the Fed, it could easily stoke inflation and undermine confidence in the US economy.\nTrump also wants to extend a set of tax cuts from 2017 that are due to expire at the end of 2025. That would raise the national debt by $4 trillion to $5 trillion, something Trump doesn’t seem to care about. But markets do. At some point, excessive amounts of debt flooding the market becomes “money printing.” That's another factor that can fuel inflation.\nEven though there are two major candidates, there are four possible outcomes for the 2024 election.\nTrump or Biden could each win with their party gaining complete control of Congress, or they could win with a divided Congress. That’s important because it will determine if the president can exploit his party’s control of Congress to pursue a partisan agenda. If the opposition party controls at least one house of Congress, it can block many of the president’s preferred policies.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nBut if Republicans gain full control, watch out.\n“The upside risks to inflation appear larger under a Republican sweep,” Goldman advised. In addition to higher tariffs and more Fed-bashing under Trump, the investment bank points out that a Trump crackdown on immigration could trim the labor force, worsen labor shortages in some industries, fuel higher wages, and push prices up.\nAnother recent analysis by Moody’s Analytics reaches similar conclusions about the economy during a second Trump term. “The policies adopted under the Republican Sweep scenario result in higher inflation and weaker economic growth,” Moody’s Analytics found. That’s largely because new import tariffs and less immigration under Trump would force prices up and drag on growth.\nIn a May analysis, Oxford Economics found that new tariffs and other Trump policies could push the inflation rate a full percentage point higher than it would be without those efforts. Inflationary Trump policies could also compel the Fed to hold off lowering interest rates and maybe even raise rates further to head off new inflationary pressures. That would likely enrage Trump and possibly compel him to try firing Fed Chair Jay Powell, whose appointment lasts until 2026.\nVoters who think back on Trump’s presidency as a time of low inflation might wonder how a second term could be so different. The answer is that the COVID pandemic and geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have transformed the economy and left far less margin for error.\nThe United States and other nations are now “re-shoring” supply chains for key categories of goods, which should make supplies less vulnerable to shocks but also raise costs. Labor shortages for much of the last three years have pushed wages up, another factor contributing to higher prices.\nGlobal energy markets are also much tighter than they were before COVID. Back then, American drillers and OPEC oil nations were competing for market share by basically oversupplying the market. That kept prices low. But plunging demand during COVID led to massive losses and new “capital discipline” that prioritizes profits over share. Virtually no energy producer is willing to overproduce these days, for any reason.\nWhile inflation soared under Biden, it’s heading back toward normal levels. Many economists expect more of the same should he win reelection: continued disinflation, eventual Fed rate cuts, predictable trade policies, and moderate growth. The ultimate status quo scenario is a Biden win with Republicans controlling at least one chamber of Congress, allowing them to block progressive Democratic legislation.\nBiden's economic agenda is still a tough sell to voters, who sometimes have selective memories. Biden is battling a “Trumpnesia” phenomenon in which voters forget about Trump’s erratic handling of the COVID pandemic and other controversies and only remember that gasoline cost less than $3 per gallon. If there’s another Trump presidential term, it could generate very different memories.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "The cash-strapped Donald Trump would surely love to quickly access the billions of dollars his newly public media company is now worth.\nHe might have no choice but to wait.\nThe former president and his allies have options to try to short-circuit the \"lock-up\" period now in place for large shareholders of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT).\nBut making such a move, a variety of corporate finance and IPO experts told Yahoo Finance this week, could very quickly become extraordinarily messy.\nHistory shows such a maneuver could lead to a stock price drop followed by an \"inevitable lawsuit\" on behalf of public market shareholders, according to Jay Ritter of the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business.\nThis is a merger that \"has already been a gravy train for lawyers,\" Ritter added, and litigation would likely begin anew if there were even a public discussion of waiving the standard short-term trading prohibition.\nUsha Rodrigues, a corporate finance and securities law specialist at the University of Georgia, largely agreed. Any downward price action following a move to waive Trump's agreement would allow shareholders to show injury and give them standing to sue, she said.\n\"There's bad optics if a founder or a major shareholder seems to be running for the hills,\" she added in an interview this week.\nThe idea behind a lock-up period is to protect a newly public company's interests and allow it to preserve stability before its founders can cash out.\nBut that six-month prohibition creates a potential dilemma for Trump as he faces a possible near-term cash crunch on multiple fronts.\nA price surge this week in the parent company of Truth Social also means his stake in the company is now worth well over $4 billion. The paper windfall has doubled Trump's net worth and put him, for the first time, among the world's 500 richest people.\nWhat remains unclear is if Trump and his allies are actively pondering an attempt to waive the lock-up period. Company representatives didn't respond to a request for comment.\nOther developments this week — notably a legal win for Trump Monday around the civil fraud judgment against him — could lessen his need for quick cash.\nBut this giant reserve of money could nonetheless be a tempting asset in the coming six months when Trump will simultaneously be trying to ward off an array of legal challenges while also trying to win an election over President Joe Biden.\nThere are some examples in recent history of newly public companies amending their lockup procedures — especially in the technology space — but none under quite the political microscope that Trump finds himself in this year.\nBut if he were to try and undertake such a move, he would start with some significant advantages.\nFor starters, his company is populated by a board of directors that is uniquely sympathetic to the former president. The seven-member panel includes multiple former Trump cabinet officials and Devin Nunes, the former congressman and current CEO of the Trump Media & Technology Group. Even Trump's own son, Don Jr., is on the board.\nTrump also owns 60% of his company's shares, making his voice determinative if he chose to participate in a shareholder vote.\nBut Trump might have no choice but to involve other shareholders, and that's where it gets complicated quickly.\nXavier Kowalski is a former M&A lawyer now at the University of Florida. He noted that Trump and his allies would likely need to call for a shareholder vote if they seek to amend the company's certificate of incorporation.\nIf Trump chose to ignore what most would consider a clear conflict of interest and participate in such a vote, Kowalski says, \"that is a dangerous fact pattern that invites a shareholder lawsuit.\"\nThe more legally sound path, it seems, would be to hold a shareholder vote but limit it to non-conflicted insiders.\nReena Aggarwal at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business pointed out how that is far from an easy process. \"It's expensive in terms of the dollars involved, and it's expensive in terms of the time involved,\" she said.\nProfessor Ritter, who is known as \"Mr. IPO\" for his work on initial public offerings, also noted such a move could backfire with it possible, and perhaps even likely, \"that the shareholders will say no.\"\nAnd even then, all that wouldn't guarantee a shareholder lawsuit wouldn't follow that could seek an injunction to try and stop the waiver attempt before Trump could sell a single share.\n\"A judge would be asked to make a decision either allowing the sale of shares or prohibiting the sale until the litigation was finished,\" predicted Ritter.\nAll these complications are likely weighing on Trump and his allies as they weigh whether to attempt such a procedure.\nThe news Monday that he won a bid Monday to pause the $454 million civil fraud judgment against him if he posts a smaller $175 million bond instead could lessen some of the pressure.\nTrump said he already has the cash to cover that smaller bond amount due next week, which would allow him to avoid potential asset seizures following his company's conviction for fraud.\nBut Trump's 2024 campaign could use the cash as well. The latest filings show Biden's reelection campaign is significantly outraising Trump. As of the end of February, the current president has $71.2 million on hand versus Trump's $33.5 million.\nAnother option that Trump could pursue to leverage the forthcoming windfall in advance would be to try and help secure a loan before the lock-up period ends. But that's seen as an even more complicated option, with language in the merger agreement that appears to explicitly prohibit Trump from using the shares as collateral.\nIn any case, Trump is now a direct participant in public markets for the first time since the early 2000s, which he has courted throughout his career with mixed success.\nProfessor Rodrigues noted that the tighter scrutiny Trump will be subject to, whether or not he tries to waive the lock-up procedure, could result in a different kind of scrutiny of Trump and his business practices with public shareholders now involved.\n\"I won't say that different rules apply, but there's a lot more attention,\" she said.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group slumped to their lowest level ever Friday, the first trading day that its biggest shareholder, former President Donald Trump, is free to sell his stake in the company behind the Truth Social platform.\nShares of Trump Media, commonly called TMTG, tumbled almost 8% to close at $13.55, putting the value of the company at less than $3 billion. Trump owns more than half of it.\nTrump and other insiders in the company have been unable to cash in on the highly volatile stock due standard lock-up agreements that prevent big stakeholders from selling stakes for a set period after a company becomes publicly traded. TMTG began trading publicly in March.\nTrump owns nearly 115 million shares of the company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on TMTG's share price early Friday, Trump's holdings are worth, at least on paper, about $1.6 billion. It's usually not in the best interest of big stakeholders to even attempt to sell large tranches of their stock because it could risk a broader sell-off.\nSince going public, shares in Trump Media have gyrated wildly, often depending on news related to Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.\nOne week ago, the company's shares jumped nearly 12% after Trump said he wouldn't sell shares when the lock-up period lifted. The stock dipped more than 10% following the debate earlier this month between Trump and the Democrats' nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. In mid-July, shares climbed more than 31% in the first day of trading following the first assassination attempt on Trump.\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp. is now worth considerably less than several months ago. When the company made its debut on the Nasdaq in March, the shares hit a high of $79.38. Friday's closing price represents a decline of 83% from that peak.\nTruth Social came into existence after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Based in Sarasota, Florida, Trump Media has been losing money and struggling to raise revenue. It lost nearly $58.2 million last year while generating only $4.1 million in revenue, according to regulatory filings."

        "article_content": "A little over three weeks ago, voters from across the country headed to the polls or mailed in their ballots to determine who would lead our country forward over the next four years. While multiple seats were up for grabs in the House and Senate, most of Wall Street was focused on the race for the White House.\nAlthough not all aspects of legislation on Capitol Hill have bearing on the stock market, elected officials are responsible for shaping the fiscal policy that can aid or inhibit corporate growth.\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »\nDuring the early morning hours of Nov. 6, the Associated Press called the election for former President Donald Trump, who ultimately earned 312 electoral votes to 226 for Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\nInvestors had plenty of reason to smile during Trump's first term in the Oval Office. From his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017 until President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20, 2021, Trump oversaw respective returns in the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) of 57%, 70%, and 142%.\nDespite beating the odds and becoming only the second president to serve in nonconsecutive terms (Grover Cleveland being the other), President-Elect Donald Trump is set to make dubious stock market history when he takes office for his second term.\nDespite all three major stock indexes soaring after Election Day, President-Elect Trump will be entering the Oval Office under extremely challenging circumstances. More specifically, no incoming president has ever inherited a stock market as pricey as the one we're looking at today.\nAdmittedly, value is in the eye of the beholder, and what one investor finds attractive from a valuation standpoint may be the opposite for someone else. But according to one historically flawless valuation tool, there have only been a select few times since the early 1870s where the stock market has been this pricey.\nMost investors are likely familiar with the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which divides a company's share price into its trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS). The traditional P/E ratio can be a fine tool for quickly assessing relative value for mature stocks, but it's often lacking in the sense that it fails to factor in future growth potential and struggles during shock events.\nBy comparison, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E ratio, which is also commonly known as the cyclically adjusted P/E ratio, or CAPE ratio, is based on average inflation-adjusted EPS from the previous 10 years. Examining 10 years' worth of earnings data smooths out the impact of shock events and leads to apples-to-apples valuation comparisons.\nAs of the closing bell on Nov. 25, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E reached 38.20, which is or more less a high reading for the current bull market, and more than double the 153-year average of 17.17, when back-tested to January 1871. More importantly, this marks the third-highest Shiller P/E reading during a continuous bull market over the last 153 years.\nThe only two times the stock market has been pricier than it is now was prior to the dot-com bubble bursting, which saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite respectively lose 49% and 78% of their value, and during late 2021/early 2022. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all endured bear market declines in 2022, with the Nasdaq, once again, getting hit the hardest.\nAnd it's not just the Shiller P/E that's foreshadowing trouble for Wall Street. The valuation tool Warren Buffett once touted as \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment,\" hit its highest reading ever in November.\nThe \"Buffett Indicator,\" which divides the market cap of publicly traded companies (via the Wilshire 5000 Index) into gross domestic product (GDP), topped 200% for the first time ever in October and nearly reached 206% this month. The average for the Buffett indicator since 1970 is about 85%, with peaks of 144% prior to the dot-com bubble and 107% before the financial crisis.\nThese historically accurate indicators suggest President-Elect Trump may oversee a sizable stock market correction.\nEven though incoming President Trump appears to have the deck stacked against him from a historic valuation standpoint, time is an invaluable ally that's working in his and investor's favor.\nFor instance, though peaks and troughs within an economic cycle are inevitable, these periods of growth and contraction aren't linear. Since World War II ended 79 years ago, the U.S. has worked its way through a dozen recessions. Three-quarters of these downturns resolved in less than a year, with the remaining three recessions failing to surpass 18 months in length.\nOn the other side of the coin, the overwhelming majority of economic expansions stuck around for multiple years, including two periods where the U.S. economy grew for at least 10 years. An expanding economy is typically good news for corporate earnings, and these periods of growth last disproportionately longer than recessions.\nThis marked disparity translates to the stock market, as well.\nThe data set you see above was posted on social media platform X in June 2023, shortly after the broad-based S&P 500 was confirmed to be in a new bull market following the 2022 bear market. The researchers at Bespoke Investment Group calculated the calendar-day length of all 27 bear and bull markets in the S&P 500 dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929.\nOver a 94-year stretch, the average length of 27 confirmed bear markets in the S&P 500 was just 286 calendar days, or 9.5 months, with the longest bear market lasting 630 calendar days (Jan. 11, 1973 through Oct. 3, 1974).\nMeanwhile, the typical S&P 500 bull market has stuck around for 1,011 calendar days, or 3.5 times as long, since September 1929. What's more, 14 of the 27 bull markets, including the current bull market, have outpaced the lengthiest bear market, in terms of calendar days.\nEven though we're never going to be able to pinpoint when stock market corrections will occur, how long they'll last, or how steep the ultimate decline will be, history decisively shows that patience is rewarded on Wall Street.\nLastly, with the S&P 500 seeing an average annual return of 14.52% since 1926 under unified Republican leadership, there's reason to be hopeful, even with select valuation tools blaring warnings over the short term.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "date": "2024-09-04T20:39:07.000Z",
        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump escalated his longstanding feud with Mark Zuckerberg by threatening the Meta CEO with prison time.\nTrump accused Zuckerberg of “plotting” against him during the 2020 election by “steering” Facebook against his campaign. Trump warned that if Zuckerberg were to do so again in the 2024 election, he would “spend the rest of his life in prison.”\nThe comments come in a new book authored by Trump called Save America. The book features photos from Trump’s term in office with captions describing the events. Trump’s threat against Zuckerberg was in a caption depicting a meeting between the two in the Oval Office.\nTrump began by noting that Zuckerberg would visit him at the Oval Office. “He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes [sic] in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. ”\nHe then accused Zuckerberg of acting disingenuously by praising him and then turning Facebook against his unsuccessful 2020 reelection campaign.\n“He told me there was nobody like Trump on Facebook. But at the same time, and for whatever reason, steered it against me,” Trump’s caption continues. “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison—as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.”\nMeta and Winning Team Publishing, the publisher of Save America, did not respond to a request for comment.\nOver the years Trump has made similar threats to other perceived enemies. During a debate in the 2016 election he memorably told former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton she’d “be in jail” if he was elected. Trump campaign rallies often featured the chant “lock her up” in reference to Clinton. At another rally in October 2022 Trump advocated for jailing a journalist in order to get them to reveal a source.\nThere is no evidence that Zuckerberg was involved in a plot against Trump while he was in office. Nor did Trump’s allegations cite any specific law that Zuckerberg may have broken. The mention of “Lock Boxes” appears to be a reference to a $420 million donation Zuckerberg’s charity made to fund election infrastructure during in 2020.\nTrump has repeatedly feuded with Zuckerberg over the years. In July, Trump made the same accusations that Zuckerberg was interfering in elections.\n“All I can say is that if I’m elected President, we will pursue Election Fraudsters at levels never seen before, and they will be sent to prison for long periods of time,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We already know who you are. DON’T DO IT! ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!”\nZuckerberg attempted to extend an olive branch to Trump after the failed assassination attempt against him in July, praising his bravery. “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life,” Zuckerberg said a few days after the shooting.\nDuring an interview with Fox Business, Trump said Zuckerberg called him several times after the assassination attempt, including to tell him he wouldn’t be endorsing a Democrat. Meta noted he has refrained from endorsing either candidate, as he's done in prior elections.\nEarlier this week, Zuckerberg waded further into politics, writing a letter to the House Judiciary Committee about Meta’s handling of government requests about COVID-19-related content in 2021. Senior officials from the Biden administration “repeatedly pressured” Meta to remove some types of COVID-19 content, “including humor and satire,” according to the letter.\n“I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it,” Zuckerberg wrote.\nIn the letter, he also mentioned the donations he made that provided things like staffing and training for local poll workers during the 2020 election which was severely impacted by the pandemic. In 2020, Zuckerberg’s philanthropic organization that he co-runs with his wife Priscilla Chan, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, made donations to the Center for Election Innovation & Research and the Center for Tech and Civic Life.\n“We are doubling down on our commitment to ensuring that every qualified jurisdiction has the resources it needs to allow every eligible citizen to vote safely and have their vote counted,” Chan and Zuckerberg said in a statement at the time of their donation.\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe donations received backlash from conservative groups that mistook them as support for Joe Biden’s candidacy. For that reason, Zuckerberg said he would not make such donations in the 2024 election.\n“Despite the analyses I've seen showing otherwise, I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other,” Zuckerberg wrote. “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another—or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Investors this year have grown increasingly confident the US economy will achieve a \"soft landing.\"\nBut the election of Donald Trump as the nation's next president has complicated the outlook.\nAnd some economists now think it's likely the US could face another inflation resurgence if Trump follows through with his key campaign promises.\n\"We are in the soft landing,\" Nobel prize-winning economist and Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz said at Yahoo Finance's annual Invest conference on Tuesday. \"But that ends Jan. 20.\"\nTrump and his proposed policies have been viewed as potentially more inflationary due to the president-elect's campaign promises of high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigration. Those policies could also pressure an already bloated federal deficit, further complicating the Federal Reserve's path forward for interest rates.\n\"The biggest risk is a large across-the-board tariff, which would likely hit growth hard,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\nJennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics, also acknowledged in a note this week there are \"upside risks\" to inflation \"stemming partly from Trump’s proposed tariff and immigration policies.\"\nAnd investors have taken notice.\nOn Wednesday, the latest Global Fund Manager Survey from Bank of America highlighted increased expectations of a \"no landing\" scenario, in which the economy continues to grow but inflation pressures persist, leading to a higher-for-longer interest rate policy from the central bank.\nTariffs have been one of the most talked-about promises of Trump's campaign. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.\n\"It will be inflationary,\" Stiglitz said. \"And then you start thinking of the inflationary spiral. The prices go up. Workers will want more wages. And then you start thinking of what happens if others retaliate [with their own duties.]\"\nMinneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari categorized a possible retaliation as a \"tit-for-tat\" trade war, which would keep inflation elevated over the long term.\n\"If inflation goes up, [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell] is going to raise interest rates,\" Stiglitz said.\n\"You combine the higher interest rates and the retaliation from other countries, you're going to get a global slowdown. Then you have the worst of all possible worlds: inflation and stagnation, or slow growth.\"\nInvestors have dialed back rate cut expectations in preparation. Since the Fed's first rate cut on Sept. 18, markets now expect three fewer rate cuts between now and the end of next year, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.\nBut the US economy has remained resilient in the face of high interest rates. Retail sales once again topped estimates for the month of October, GDP remains strong, the unemployment rate continues to hover at around 4%, and inflation has moderated despite its bumpy path down to 2%. \nAdditionally, it remains unclear which policies will be a priority once Trump takes office or if he'll fully commit to the promises he's already made.\nThe only certainty is change.\nIn 2025, the GOP has not only secured the White House but also maintained control of the House of Representatives and flipped the Senate.\n\"The Republican sweep in the elections is likely to bring sweeping policy changes,\" Bank of America's US economics team wrote in a client note on Friday.\n\"There are plausible scenarios in which growth could run above 3%, or the economy could enter a recession,\" the team said. \"Our base case is sanguine, but our conviction is low. As the policy agenda becomes clearer next year, we will be nimble in adjusting our forecasts as needed.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

They have already helped reshape the 2024 race in recent months with Trump vacuuming up magnate money to lessen his fundraising gap with Joe Biden.\nOne show of support came from David Sacks, a billionaire tech investor who is reportedly set to host a Silicon Valley fundraiser for Trump in the coming weeks.\nHe immediately reacted to the verdict by posting that \"there is now only one issue in this election: whether the American people will stand for the USA becoming a Banana Republic.\"\nTrump and his supporters have long dismissed the trial as politically motivated.\nThe former president was convicted Thursday on 34 counts related to falsifying business records around a $130,000 payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. The prosecution successfully convinced the jury that Daniels was paid in order to influence the results of the 2016 election.\nThere is little expectation that Trump’s multiple convictions will lose him support in donor corners.\nIn a Yahoo Finance Live appearance after the verdict, Veda Partners director of economic policy Henrietta Treyz pointed out that many donors have been giving in recent months even as they watched for this verdict.\n“I don't think he will lose any support from the high-dollar donors,” she said.\nAnother quick respondent was Musk, who weighed in quickly with a series of posts on the \"troubling\" verdict.\n\"Great damage was done today to the public’s faith in the American legal system,\" he said in one.\nThe posts came after a new Wall Street Journal report earlier this week revealed Musk's close engagement and access with Trump, with the two men having phone conversations multiple times a month.\nMusk has said he doesn’t plan to give Trump money but has thrown his support behind him while other billionaires are opening their wallets.\nFigures from Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman and hotel tycoon Robert Bigelow to Continental Resources founder and chairman Harold Hamm have all been prominent Trump givers in recent months.\nThe influx has helped Trump raise about $76 million in April and best Biden's $51 million total that month. Trump raised over $50 million at a single event with billionaires in early April.\nBut Biden is still ahead when it comes to cash in the bank, with $192 million saved across his operation at the beginning of May.\nBiden’s campaign has been slamming Trump’s coziness with these elites but has nevertheless raised some money from business leaders himself.\nA West Coast fundraising trip from Biden in early May saw the President stop at an event co-hosted by Marissa Mayer, the former CEO of Yahoo. Another stop, according to pool reports, was at the home of Jon Shirley, the former president of Microsoft (MSFT).\nBut, at least this week, much of the most vocal business leader commentary has come in on Trump’s side.\nTake Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital. The Financial Times reported on his Trump leanings just this week, and the billionaire himself made it more official after Thursday's verdict.\nHe reposted (and seconded) a message from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that said that the verdict was a result of \"the political agenda of some kangaroo court.\"\nHow this high-dollar support translates to votes remains to be seen.\nTreyz pointed to DeSantis (whom Ackman had previously supported) as an example of a candidate who was able to attract high-dollar donors — but less adept at translating that into votes.\n“Everybody gets one vote no matter how much money you give,” she noted.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that he would like a \"say\" in setting interest rates if he is reelected, further raising the prospect that the Republican nominee could seek to reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve if he wins in November.\n\"I feel the president should have at least say in there, yeah, I feel that strongly,\" the presidential candidate said in response to a question about the US central bank interest rate policy and the prospects of a soft landing for the US economy.\nThe brief comments came near the end of a news conference Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.\nThe comment also came after allies of the former president have floated a series of ideas in recent months that could undercut an independent Federal Reserve, ranging from firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to a plan first reported in the Wall Street Journal that has the president himself playing a role in setting interest rates.\nTrump has previously said he thinks he has the authority to fire the Federal Reserve chair, though some legal experts disagree.\nRead more: How much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates?\nBut this week's comments were the strongest indication yet that Trump does, in fact, want some direct involvement with the central bank operations if he were to reach the Oval Office again.\n\"In my case, I've made a lot of money. I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Trump said this week.\nTrump also offered some new criticism of the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Thursday, saying Powell and his colleagues have \"gotten it wrong a lot.\"\n\"He's tending to be a little bit late on things. He gets a little bit too early and a little bit too late.\"\nTrump has also spent much of 2024 turning up the political pressure on the Federal Reserve as policymakers make it clear they are getting closer to cutting interest rates.\nTrump has signaled he will criticize any rate cuts before the election, saying in a recent Fox Business interview, \"I think [Powell's] going to do something to probably help the Democrats.\"\nAnd in an interview with Bloomberg published last month, the Republican nominee again reiterated that central bank officials should not ease monetary policy before the November election.\n\"It's something that they know they shouldn't be doing,\" he said.\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nTrump, in his Bloomberg interview, said he would \"let\" Powell serve out his term and added: \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"\nPowell was asked last month during his testimony before Congress if he intended to stay through the end of his term as chair in May 2026, and he gave a one-word answer: \"Yes.\"\nWhen asked if he would stay longer should he be reappointed as chair, he said, \"I have nothing on that for you today.\"\nPowell's full term as a member of the Fed's board of governors doesn't end until 2028 but his time atop the Federal Reserve as chair ends sooner, in 2026.\nStephen Moore, a top Trump confidant, said during an appearance last month on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast that when Powell's term expires, \"then we would look for someone new, maybe a Judy Shelton or a Larry Kudlow or an Arthur Laffer or somebody who's more in line with his economic philosophy.\"\nAnd in her own Yahoo Finance appearance, Shelton questioned whether the Federal Reserve should exist and argued that a rate cut before the election would be inherently political.\n“It is too prominent,” the one-time nominee by Trump to join the Federal Reserve board in 2020 said of the central bank. “We shouldn’t be talking about the Fed’s next move.\"\nTrump on Thursday also acknowledged a rocky relationship with Powell, whom he elevated to Fed Chair in 2018.\nHe often weighed in to pressure Powell to lower rates while he was president and even contemplated firing Powell before deciding against it.\n\"I had it out with him a couple of times very strongly,\" Trump said.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Stocks notched their best week of the year as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda.\n“Tax cuts are behind the rally … and in general, there is the perception that markets like Republican administrations, although certainly the performance for the past few years of the Democratic administration has not exactly been shabby,” Interactive Brokers' Steve Sosnick explained to me on Yahoo Finance's special election coverage.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) skyrocketed more than 1,700 points from Wednesday through Friday, closing the week up 4.6%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged to a record, while the Russell 2000 (^RUT) hit its highest level since November 2021.\nBut the market should be careful what it wishes for. Experts tell me as clarity emerges, a resurgence in inflation from trade tariffs and additional government spending could pose a risk to the market’s momentum and temper rate cuts from the Fed.\n“The sharp spike [in the markets] is, to some extent, a reaction to the expectation of solid growth, deregulation, tax cuts … But the other part of that, of course, is that it can lead to greater inflation and wider fiscal deficits,” Sonal Desai, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income chief investment officer, told me on Catalysts.\nStifel’s Barry Bannister, who sees a downside risk of 5,250 for the S&P 500 a year from now, is keeping a close watch for a resurgence in inflation. S&P closed out the week above 6,000.\n\"If inflation proves resurgent … we suspect Chairman Powell's last 12 months in office (May 2025 to May 2026) are a significant investor risk, magnified by the repercussions of the approaching 2026 US midterm elections,\" Bannister wrote in a note to clients.\nTruist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner echoed the point on a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast (listen in below).\nDeutsche Bank anticipates Trump’s fiscal, trade, and immigration policies could result in an upward adjustment to its inflation forecast. The team, led by Matthew Luzzetti, projects inflation could rise by roughly 0.5% in 2026 to about 2.5%, primarily due to the inflationary impact of tariffs.\nReports Friday that Trump asked Robert Lighthizer to return to his administration as US trade Representative could signal a more aggressive approach to tariffs. During Trump’s first term, Lighthizer played a key role in his escalating trade war with China, implemented tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and helped renegotiate the US's trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.\nFor investors, hardware stocks are among the tech stocks that are \"most at-risk\" given smartphones, PCs, tablets, wearables, and servers are still primarily assembled in China, according to Morgan Stanley.\n“We estimate that if President-elect Trump were to use executive orders to reinstitute Section 301 tariffs on goods imported from China, our coverage would face, on average, 4-7% downside to FY25 EPS,” Erik Woodring wrote in a note to clients this week, warning that Dell (DELL), HPQ (HPQ), and Logitech (LOGI) would face the “greatest headwinds.”\nThe prospect of tariffs, coupled with an extension of the 2017 tax cuts, are a “highly dangerous” mix for the economy and the market and could lead to higher prices, according to veteran economist Nouriel Roubini.\n“If you take at face value what he wants to do on trade, on currency, on monetary and fiscal policy, [the policies would] be highly dangerous,\" Roubini warned on Morning Brief earlier this year.\nOther tax-related ideas floated by Trump, including lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% and a pledge to end taxing on tips, overtime pay, and social security benefits, point to additional risks of a ballooning deficit.\n“For the first time in my lifetime, I'm actually becoming very concerned,” Dennis Gartman, former editor of the Gartman Letter, told me. \"I'm worried about the economy and the country fiscally going forward for the younger generation.”\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the policies outlined by Trump through his campaign could add $7.75 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, driven in part by plans to extend tax cuts, further cut taxes for corporations and small businesses, and expand deportations.\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon made it clear Thursday they won’t be joining forces in government.\n\"I wish the president well,\" Dimon said during a Bloomberg interview. \"I’ve not had a boss in 25 years, and I’m not ready to start,\" he added. It was his first public conversation since the US election.\nBut the president-elect got there first. He took to Truth Social roughly thirty minutes before Dimon’s talk to dispel rumors.\n“I respect Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, greatly, but he will not be invited to be a part of the Trump Administration. I thank Jamie for his outstanding service to our Country!” Trump’s Truth Social account said in a post at 2 p.m. ET.\nSo far, Trump has largely stocked his Cabinet with his closest loyalists and ruled out voices who have offered nearly any recent criticism. Trump previously preemptively ruled out — also in a social media post — appointing former rival Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nLeading up to the US election, Dimon, who has been an outspoken voice on a range of issues, did not give a full-throated endorsement of either Vice President Kamala Harris or Trump.\nHe did offer them advice, Yahoo Finance has reported, via informal and formal advisers to both candidates. And the scrutiny of his views intensified as both campaigns eyed a potential Dimon endorsement as a final sought-after prize.\nTrump made sure to praise Dimon in Thursday’s post and, in October, Trump’s account even posted a false claim of a Dimon endorsement.\nThe public attention on Dimon comes as the speculation around Trump’s economic team intensifies, with the president-elect moving to quickly name his team following last week’s election victory.\nSo far, Trump has focused mostly on non-economic areas with a raft of controversial picks, from Rep. Matt Gaetz as his nominee for attorney general to Fox News anchor Pete Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense.\nThe picks for top economic jobs are expected to come within days.\nA variety of figures, from investor Scott Bessent to former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, are seen as potentially in line for positions, including the coveted role of Treasury Secretary.\nDimon won’t be among them but, as the New York Times and Yahoo Finance had reported, Dimon joining a Trump White House was never really likely. One source said the CEO favored Harris in private. In the days leading to Election Day, Dimon’s wife Judy had also volunteered with the Harris campaign.\nThough much is uncertain about what a Trump administration will mean for the economy, US bank stocks rallied after Trump's victory in a sign that financial institutions expect to have an easier time in Washington under a new Republican administration.\nDimon himself has called for fewer regulations, recently blasting \"an onslaught\" from overseers under the current Biden administration.\nOn Thursday, he said he does expect the Trump administration to pull back current regulation and make it easier for companies to do mergers.\nHowever, given his concern over the current geopolitical environment, Dimon still thinks the chance that the US economy pulls off a \"soft landing\" is \"less than other people think.\"\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.

        "article_content": "The business world is expecting M&A to loosen up under President Donald Trump.\nIt could be in for a surprise — if history is any guide.\nTrump’s first term in office was arguably just as tough for merger and acquisition approvals as President Joe Biden's term, as measured by the number of merger enforcement challenges brought by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.\nBetween fiscal years 2017 and 2019, a period that roughly corresponds with Trump’s first three years in office, the DOJ and FTC brought 118 M&A challenges, according to annual reports issued by the agencies.\nThat was a higher cumulative total than the 108 brought between fiscal years 2021 and 2023, a period that roughly corresponds with Biden’s first three years in office.\nBiden, however, did achieve the highest single-year total of 50 merger challenges in fiscal 2022 — the largest annual count in more than two decades.\n\"While we can expect robust deregulation\" in a new Trump administration, \"we shouldn’t necessarily expect this laissez-faire attitude to spill over into the antitrust realm,\" said Danny Karon, an antitrust lecturer and advisory board member of Loyola University Chicago School of Law's Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies.\nJustin Stewart-Teitelbaum, a partner in the Freshfields law firm who specializes in antitrust, said he anticipates the Trump-Vance administration to continue merger scrutiny at a rate similar to Trump's first term but with a focus on negotiating resolutions rather than litigating cases.\n“Given Trump and (Vice President-elect JD) Vance’s embrace of populist themes, we anticipate continued scrutiny of mergers, although not an inherent skepticism of M&A activity,\" Stewart-Teitelbaum added, noting that he expects the new administration to encourage divestments and protect against post-acquisition layoffs.\nWhat most observers do expect to happen is for the new administration to remove Biden-appointed FTC Chair Lina Khan, who challenged several high-profile corporate mergers during her time as boss of the FTC and emerged as a public foe of major American companies.\nTrump is \"certain\" to fire Khan, Karon said.\nBut a new FTC chair would not necessarily be averse to the government pursuing several Big Tech antitrust cases against Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META).\n\"Several of these cases were initiated during Trump’s first term; plus, he’s no fan of Facebook,\" Karon said of Trump.\nThere could be some early signs in the next month of which way the Trump administration is leaning, based on who gets top jobs at the FTC and DOJ's antitrust division.\nOne figure who will have a hand in those decisions is antitrust technology attorney Gail Slater, an aide to Vice President-elect Vance. She is advising Trump's transition team on a replacement for Khan, according to a report by Bloomberg.\nThe candidates being considered for top jobs include Alex Okuliar, an antitrust lawyer who was part of the DOJ's initial Google investigation that resulted in a lawsuit against the online search giant during Trump's first term. Okuliar served as deputy attorney general in the department's antitrust division.\nAnother way to gauge the M&A aggressiveness of the next administration is the number of \"second requests\" the DOJ and FTC issue to companies looking to merge.\nSo-called second requests are significant in that they allow regulators to conduct an in-depth investigation of a proposed merger or acquisition if the tie-up raises competitive concerns. That triggers the possibility of a formal merger challenge.\nSecond requests are considered a burden that tends to deter M&A activity due to the delays they cause and the expenses associated with complying.\nSuch second requests did dip under Biden following a flurry of enforcement actions in 2022, according to financial consulting group Cornerstone Research.\nCornerstone attributed the decrease to fewer actions taken by the DOJ, which filed 11 second requests in fiscal 2023 and spent much of its time prosecuting more high-profile antitrust cases.\n\"This is half as many as the prior year and by far the lowest number over the prior 20 years,\" Cornerstone said in a report\nOn a percentage basis, second requests were also more prevalent under Trump's first three years, happening in 2.6% to 3% of merger transactions reported. Under Biden, second requests were issued for 1.9% to 2.1% of reported transactions.\nA total of 157 second requests were issued during the years that roughly corresponded with Trump's first three years in office. During the years that roughly corresponded with Biden's first three years in office, a total of 149 second requests were issued.\nBoth the Trump and Biden administrations were also aggressive in challenging companies on competition concerns, alleging monopoly behavior.\nIn fact, it was Trump’s first administration that initially sued Google on antitrust grounds, citing Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.\nThe Biden administration took over the case, leading to a ruling by a district court judge in August that the tech giant illegally monopolized the search engine market.\nSection 2 prosecutions had been dormant since 1998 when the DOJ under former president Bill Clinton sued Microsoft (MSFT).\nIt was also Trump’s first administration that sought to block AT&T's (T) merger with Time Warner, unwind Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and launch an investigation into Apple, leading the Biden administration to sue the iPhone maker earlier this year.\nBut Biden's DOJ and FTC took Section 2 even further.\nThe DOJ sued Google in a second antitrust case over online advertising technology and pressed forward with lawsuits against Live Nation (LYV) and Visa (V). The FTC filed similar charges against Amazon.\nThere’s no guarantee that a second Trump administration will be as aggressive as the first.\nThe business world is expecting some relief. The days following Trump’s win were marked by run-ups in the stocks of some companies currently facing antitrust or merger challenges and predictions that the corporate dealmaking environment is about to get much better.\nAnd for good reason. Trump has promised pro-business policies, such as eliminating burdensome regulations, cutting corporate tax rates, and dethroning cryptocurrency skeptic SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\nSeveral big tech CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, offered public and private praise to Trump following his election victory.\nBut when it comes to scrutinizing corporate tie-ups, investors expecting something different may be in for a surprise.\n\"Some of the perceptions on these stock moves — that we're hearing about a new antitrust world — I thought, that may be a little bit of irrational exuberance,\" antitrust attorney Mark Wagoner told Yahoo Finance.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Donald Trump has not been shy about discussing the stock market since he left office in 2021, with his rhetoric changing dramatically depending on Wall Street's ups and downs.\nHe kept taking credit for a rally even after he departed Washington; he compared a 2022 downturn to the Great Depression; he downplayed the recovery; and he is now back to taking credit (while also predicting a crash).\nThere are in total at least five distinct phases of how Trump has talked about the performance of Wall Street in the 37 months since Biden succeeded him, according to a Yahoo Finance analysis of his comments.\nWhat the analysis shows is how Trump's comments one day can be diametrically opposed to what he said months or weeks before.\nBut his continued focus on this issue points to a campaign season ahead where market fluctuations may be oft-discussed, especially after President Joe Biden recently bragged on the market highs after years of avoiding the topic.\n\"If he's elected,\" Trump said in 2020 while pointing across the debate stage at Biden, \"the stock market will crash.\"\nIt didn't, of course. Far from it.\nHere are the ways Trump has revised and extended his remarks in the years since.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed at 3,798.91 on Jan. 19, 2021, just before Biden was sworn into office. The market would spend much of the rest of the year headed upward, with the index ending 2021 at 4,766.18, an increase of more than 25%.\nWith Trump's prediction of a crash clearly not panning out, the now-former president chose instead to keep taking credit.\nIn a February 2021 speech — after having been out of office for over a month — Trump was still talking about \"our stock market.\"\n\"Your 401(k)s are again at record levels, higher than ever before actually,\" he told a crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\nTrump also often claimed — in a theme that he has echoed countless times up to today — that he doesn't get enough credit for the rebound in stock prices in late 2020 after a fall in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"We did something amazing and the stock market was higher in the end,\" he said just last month during a town hall on Fox News.\nThe years 2022 and 2023 were bumpier times for markets.\nThe S&P 500 closed at a record high of 4,796.56 on Jan. 3, 2022. It was a high-water mark that wouldn't be bested for over two years and Trump pivoted during that time to blaming Biden.\n\"We are a failing nation,\" he told a crowd of Ohioans in November 2022, pointing to the lower stock market as key evidence.\n\"Does anybody have a 401(k)? Raise your hand if you're happy with it,\" he added before an Iowa crowd in March 2023. \"I'll tell you this, they were happy when I was running this country.\"\nHe also stretched credulity by comparing 2022, which saw the market fall by 18%, to the crash that began in 1929 that cost stocks 90% of their value between 1929 and 1932.\nThe good news for investors (and Biden) was that the market soon recovered and notched gains throughout 2023. It began breaking all-time records by the end of the year.\nThis led to a brief — and very un-Trumplike — phase where the former president tried to downplay the stock market as an important indicator.\n\"The stock market is making rich people richer,\" he disapprovingly told a crowd in Durham, N.H., in December soon after the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hit a new record high and topped 37,000 for the first time.\nHe offered similar comments in Reno the next day and charged Biden with overseeing an economy \"collapsing into a cesspool.\"\nBut Trump pivoted again early this year as he began winning primary contests.\nHe took advantage of market highs in January that coincided with his victories in Iowa and New Hampshire.\nHe claimed, without evidence, that the highs were due to his wins and the increasing chances of a second Trump administration.\n\"As soon as it becomes clear on election night that we've defeated crooked Joe Biden, you will see your 401(k) soar and you already see it,\" Trump told a New Hampshire crowd the day after winning the Iowa caucus. He claimed prices rise \"every time we have a good poll or every time we have a night like we did last night.\"\nBut stocks were actually down on Jan. 16, the day after Trump's Iowa victory. That day's trading session was focused on other issues such as bad news for Boeing (BA), which dragged the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 230 points. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also saw declines that day.\nTrump-linked stocks like Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC), on the other hand, were up that day.\nNow as Trump has settled into the role of the likely GOP nominee, his rhetoric has shifted again. Call it stage five. He's returned to his claim that the election of Biden will result in an economic crash.\nTrump's rallies often end with the former president speaking in dramatic tones over a soaring orchestral song. A recent addition to that climactic routine has been a new mention of stocks.\n\"We are a nation whose stock market's continued success is contingent upon MAGA winning the next election,\" he told a crowd in New Hampshire in January as the music swelled.\nThe full-circle nature of Trump's commentary was underlined a few weeks later in South Carolina when he again returned to an old favorite: the Great Depression.\n\"If we don't win the next election, the stock market will crash just like it did in 1929,\" he said.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Congress and President Joe Biden agreed months ago to outlaw TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. Donald Trump’s reelection could throw a potential wrench into that plan.\nTrump’s statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of a law signed by Biden in April that makes Chinese ownership of the app illegal.\nThe law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner or have it banned from operations in the country.\nBiden set Jan. 19, a day before Trump is scheduled to be sworn into office, as a deadline for the required divestment — unless the company is able to overturn the law in a court case currently playing out in Washington, D.C.\nOnce back in office, President-elect Trump could ask Congress to undo the law. His chances to do so, if he chooses, may have improved this past week after it was confirmed that Republicans secured enough votes to control both chambers of Congress.\nIn September, the president-elect suggested in a post to his social media website, Truth Social, that he would \"save TikTok\" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app.\n\"We’re not doing anything with TikTok, but the other side is going to close it up, so if you like TikTok, go out and vote for Trump,\" the former president said in the post.\nOne political complication for Trump is that he spent his time in office and on the campaign trail promising to protect Americans and US industry against Chinese espionage and other economic threats.\nBut Trump-Vance transition team spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, when asked about TikTok, indicated that the president-elect would follow through on what he pledged.\nShe told Yahoo Finance that “the American people reelected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.”\nByteDance isn’t necessarily waiting on a new Trump administration to save TikTok. It has asked the District of Columbia’s US Court of Appeals to evaluate the constitutionality of the law.\nThe appeals court heard arguments from both sides on Sept. 16, and lawyers for the Justice Department asked the judges to issue their ruling by Dec. 6.\nThe court could issue a decision either before or after Trump’s inauguration. The losing side could also appeal the result to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority.\nByteDance’s argument to the appeals court is that the law ran afoul of the First Amendment’s free speech protections, the Fifth Amendment’s takings clause, and protections against bills of attainder — also known as ex post facto laws that deem previously legal activity as illegal and then reach back in time to punish violators for past actions.\nThe Justice Department, on the other hand, argues that compelling US national security interests justify restricting a foreign adversary from owning, directing, and controlling a platform like TikTok, including operation of the app's recommendation algorithms and editorial decisions.\nFifty-five members of Congress have also urged the D.C. appeals court to uphold the law, emphasizing that Congress chose to enact it after identifying specific threats from China.\nFBI Director Christopher Wray has testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that TikTok \"screams\" of US security concerns because government authorities can demand that TikTok hand over user data.\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, however, told members of Congress that same month that \"ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government” and “is a private company.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Investors are ramping up bets that Trump 2.0 will loosen the federal government’s grip over mortgage giants Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), ending one of the oldest fights on Wall Street.\nThe stocks of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae — semi-acronyms for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association — have jumped 116% and 143% since Donald Trump’s election win, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nThey both play a central role in the US housing market by purchasing mortgages from lenders and repackaging them as securities, and both fell under government control during the 2008 financial crisis as mortgage defaults soared.\nSome of Wall Street’s most prominent investors, including John Paulson and Bill Ackman, began wagering that the companies would eventually be returned to private control by purchasing common and preferred stock in Fannie and Freddie.\nThey hoped it would happen during the first Trump administration, only to see that effort fizzle. Now some believe a second Trump administration can get it done, even if it still takes some more time.\n\"It is 100%, in my mind, mechanically doable by 2027,\" said Mark Calabria, the former director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which oversees the two mortgage giants.\nHe put the odds of such a development at 70%, saying \"there's zero chance\" it will happen in 2025.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in September that former Trump administration figures and bankers had been discussing a privatization of the mortgage giants, but Trump himself was mum on the topic while campaigning.\nThe argument for doing it is that selling the government’s stakes in the companies is not only written into law but could also generate billions that could be used to reduce the deficit and return money to taxpayers. The argument against it is that it could affect access to credit in the housing market, which relies on Fannie and Freddie to fund 30-year mortgages.\nRead more: How mortgage-backed securities: impact the housing market and interest rates\nMuch will also depend on whom Trump picks to run the FHFA and the Treasury Department.\nPaulson, a billionaire hedge fund manager who made a fortune betting against subprime mortgages during the 2008 crisis, had been rumored as a candidate for the Treasury post but said last week that \"my complex financial obligations would prevent me from holding an official position in President Trump’s administration.\"\nIt has been a long, uneven ride for hedge funds that began wagering on a privatization of Fannie and Freddie after the Treasury Department injected a total of $189 billion into the institutions.\nThe federal government altered the terms of its takeover agreement in 2012, as Fannie and Freddie returned to profitability, by sweeping all net profits of those institutions into the Treasury Department as dividends.\nThat hurt the bets taken by Wall Street investors. The value of Fannie and Freddie's common stock plummeted and shareholder lawsuits followed.\nThere was new hope once Trump came into office in 2017 that Wall Street’s long-running bet would pay off, with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Calabria supportive of returning the companies to private hands.\nThe administration released a report in September 2019 that offered a plan for returning them to private ownership with a government backstop.\nThe idea was to increase the capital held by the mortgage companies and then eventually sell the government’s ownership in a massive public offering. The companies could pay a fee for their future reliance on a US government backstop.\nBut the administration ran out of time on that plan.\n\"Had it not been for the pandemic, you know, we would have got them out of conservatorship and back on their feet,\" Calabria said.\nGiven the work done by the last Trump administration, the new one could go back to that Trump 1.0 framework for how privatization of the mortgage giants could work, complete with the fee paid to retain future government support.\n\"The upside\" of privatizing Fannie and Freddie would be \"restoring the innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit\" of the institutions, said former Freddie Mac executive Edward Golding, who also served as head of the Federal Housing Administration during the Obama administration and now is executive director at the MIT Golub Center for Finance.\nBut Golding was also quick to caution that there could be unintended ramifications to the housing market.\n\"You do have to be careful turning over duopoly power to the private sector,\" he added.\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

Elizabeth Warren after the news, but she added that she was happy that lower rates are now in place.\nWarren, who previously advocated for a 75 basis point cut, added Wednesday that “more rate cuts are needed.”\nPresident Biden on Thursday said the move was “a signal we’ve entered a new phase of our economy and our recovery.”\nHarris added in her own statement the move is \"welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices [but] my focus is on the work ahead to keep bringing prices down.\"\nRead more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts\nTrump has been the loudest critic of the Fed all year long while on the campaign trail.\nHe told Bloomberg in June that cuts are something \"they know they shouldn't be doing.\" That came after a February Fox Business interview, where Trump said of cuts, \"I think [Powell's] going to do something to probably help the Democrats.\"\nThen he raised eyebrows last month when he offered that the president should \"have a say\" in Fed decisions and that Powell has \"gotten it wrong a lot.\"\nTrump's new critique is one he telegraphed this week before the Fed acted.\n\"They'll do the rate cut and all the political stuff,\" Trump told a Michigan crowd Tuesday night before the news came in about the widely expected cut.

        "date": "2024-11-30T20:16:38.000Z",
        "article_content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday threatened 100% tariffs against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar.\nHis threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRIC alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.\nTurkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members and several other countries have expressed interest in joining.\nWhile the U.S. dollar is by far the most-used currency in global business and has survived past challenges to its preeminence, members of the alliance and other developing nations say they are fed up with America’s dominance of the global financial system.\nThe dollar represents roughly 58% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves, according to the IMF and major commodities like oil are still primarily bought and sold using dollars. The dollar's dominance is threatened, however, with BRICS' growing share of GDP and the alliance's intent to trade in non-dollar currencies — a process known as de-dollarization.\nTrump, in a Truth Social post, said: “We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy.\"\nAt a summit of BRIC nations in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of “weaponizing” the dollar and described it as a “big mistake.”\n“It’s not us who refuse to use the dollar,” Putin said at the time. “But if they don’t let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives.”\nRussia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network, SWIFT, and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners.\nTrump said there is \"no chance\" BRIC will replace the U.S. dollar in global trade and any country that tries to make that happen \"should wave goodbye to America.”\nResearch shows that the U.S. dollar's role as the primary global reserve currency is not threatened in the near future.\nAn Atlantic Council model that assesses the dollar’s place as the primary global reserve currency states the dollar is “secure in the near and medium term” and continues to dominate other currencies.\nTrump's latest tariff threat comes after he threatened to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tax on goods from China, as a way to force the countries to do more to halt the flow of illegal immigration and drugs into the U.S.\nHe has since held a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau returned home Saturday after meeting Trump, without assurances the president-elect will back away from threatened tariffs on Canada."

        "article_content": "(Bloomberg) -- President-elect Donald Trump and his team consulted with Trae Stephens, executive chairman of defense technology startup Anduril Industries Inc., underscoring the incoming administration’s plans to shake up the US military, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nParis to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees\nTrump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy\nNew York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll\nTokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting\nNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes\nTrump and other members of his inner circle met Thursday with Stephens to discuss ways to transform the nation’s defense, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation. Stephens, also a partner in Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm Founders Fund, previously worked in support of US intelligence and on Capitol Hill.\nSeveral prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists threw their weight behind Trump and his running mate, US Senator JD Vance, who invested in Anduril’s first venture round while at Steve Case’s firm Revolution. Elon Musk has emerged as Trump’s staunchest ally, spending more than $100 million on the election effort and lending the campaign credibility among many within the tech industry.\nSpokespeople for Anduril had no immediate comment while the Trump transition didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump has promised to revamp the US defense establishment, cutting waste and modernizing how weapons are made and procured. Anduril, valued at $14 billion in its most recent funding round, makes underwater vehicles, surveillance tools and autonomous weapons systems, and sees itself as an alternative to more established military contractors.\nThose changes are already under way with a series of iconoclastic picks for key national security jobs. This week, Trump named former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary and staunch loyalist Representative Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. All three will need to be confirmed by the US Senate.\nThe outreach to Stephens also highlights the continuing influence of Thiel, who supported Trump in 2016 and helped place several of his mentees and allies in key roles during the first administration.\nMichael Kratsios, previously a principal at Thiel’s eponymous private investment firm Thiel Capital, served as US Chief Technology Officer before joining Thiel-backed Scale AI in 2021. He joined the president-elect’s transition team earlier this week to handle tech policy, according to Politico. Thiel’s longtime colleague Ken Howery also served as Ambassador to Sweden in Trump’s first term.\nAnduril was co-founded by Stephens and Palmer Luckey, one of the creators of the Oculus virtual reality headset and an ardent Trump backer. The company has blossomed into an important US government contractor as it vies with traditional defense giants for a larger piece of national security business.\nStephens begin his career two decades ago working on Capitol Hill and for the political affairs office at the Embassy of Afghanistan in Washington. He graduated from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, according to Anduril’s website.\n--With assistance from Lizette Chapman and Stephanie Lai.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nJaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers\nTrump and the Triumph of America’s New Elite\nTrump’s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires\nCompanies With Immigrant Workforces Are Preparing for Raids\nDeep in the Jungle, Virus Hunters Are Working to Stop the Next Pandemic\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

        "article_content": "Trump took his trade rhetoric to new heights in multiple appearance this week from Pennsylvania to Georgia to North Carolina, doubling down on plans for up to 200% tariffs on autos from Mexico and even raising the possibility of targeting specific companies if they try to move their manufacturing outside of the US.\n\"The word tariff, properly used, is a beautiful word,\" Trump said in a speech in Savannah, Ga., where he offered some new details on his plan for blanket tariffs.\nThat followed a Monday stop where he promised a 200% tariff on John Deere's (DE) imports if the company moves to Mexico. He has previously discussed such a tariff on automobiles from Mexico, but he extended the threat this week to the company in particular — saying it would apply to \"everything that you want to sell into the United States.\"\nIn Tuesday's speech, Trump also mentioned by name companies like GE (GE) and IBM (IBM) that have moved some operations overseas in recent years. He said his moves would cause them to “come sprinting back to our shores.\"\nAlso this week, the GOP nominee reiterated his desire to move unilaterally, saying, “I don't need Congress, but they'll approve it. I'll have the right to impose them myself, if they don’t.”\nIt's a series of plans that the Kamala Harris campaign has said could lead to a recession and billionaire investor Mark Cuban called \"ridiculously bad and destructive.\" A wide spectrum of economists also have been critical and said these duties could raise prices and spur new inflation.\nTuesday's speech by Trump also featured an extended discussion of his plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 15%, calling it the \"centerpiece\" of his plan to entice foreign companies to bring manufacturing into the US.\n\"Under my leadership, we are going to take other countries' jobs, we are going to take their factories,\" Trump promised, suggesting a combination of carrots (like a lower tax rate and regulation) alongside sticks (his tariffs) would change companies’ manufacturing plans.\nBut the topic Trump returned to again and again throughout the week was trade.\nTrump reiterated his plans for tariffs on autos, promising tariffs either at 100% or 200% levels for autos coming across the Mexican border while promising \"we're going to be making autos at a level you’ve never seen before.\"\n\"This is the policy that built America and this is policy that will save America,\" Trump added on Tuesday.\nThroughout the campaign, the former president has promised to levy duties of 10% to 20% on US trading partners and 60% on China if he is returned to the Oval Office.\nTrump aides have also explored new avenues in recent years to help a reelected Trump implement tariffs more quickly and perhaps at higher levels than in his first term, indeed without input from Congress.\n“There certainly is a lot of current law that permits tariffs to be put in place in various circumstances,” former Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recently said of Trump’s possible options.\nLighthizer and other Trump allies have publicly discussed different laws to get his tariffs done quickly and at higher levels than his previous term if he wins.\nOne previously un-utilized option is a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to declare an economic emergency and act accordingly.\nThis latest move from Trump came after the Harris campaign continued to hammer the GOP over the subject and drive its message that Trump’s tariff plans would be akin to a nearly $4,000 \"national sales tax.\"\nThe campaign released a new letter Tuesday from more than 400 mostly left-leaning economists who focused on the tariffs, writing that \"Donald Trump’s proposed policies risk reigniting inflation and threaten the United States’ global standing and domestic economic stability.\"\nCuban, in a call with reporters where he slammed Trump's recent comments on John Deere, said of the candidate's approach in general that \"he doesn't think these things through.\"\nCuban added he wasn’t opposed to some strategic duties, but “where it turns into lunacy is where you do across-the-board tariffs.\" It was a message Harris echoed the message in an MSNBC interview saying \"you don’t just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board.\"\nThe back and forth also came as the White House continued to put forth strategic protectionism with a proposed ban on Chinese-connected car technology ahead of Friday when an aggressive new set of previously announced tariffs levied against China-made industrial products are set to go into effect.\nThis post has been updated with additional developments.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seems to be getting a big assist from the world’s richest person in the crucial last few days of the 2024 campaign. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is on track to pour more than $130 million into Trump’s campaign effort, and he’s even running a ground operation in Pennsylvania to lure late-breaking swing voters to Trump’s side.\nIt could backfire. Yahoo Finance surveyed more than 4,000 of our regular users and found that Musk’s involvement with Trump’s campaign could have the opposite of the intended effect.\nWe asked respondents if Musk’s newfound alliance with Trump would make people more or less likely to vote for the former president. Among all respondents, 25% said it would make them more likely to vote for Trump, while 28% said it would make them less likely. That’s a net loss for Trump of 3 percentage points. Forty-six percent said it wouldn’t affect their voting choice either way.\nAmong people saying they remain undecided, 21% said Musk’s involvement would make them more likely to vote for Trump, while 28% said less likely. That’s a 7-point deficit among the types of voters likely to make the difference in a race that’s so tight analysts consider it a coin toss.\nThis is not a randomized survey, and the Yahoo Finance audience tends to be wealthier, more educated, and older than the electorate overall. But our survey is a large and useful focus group of investors — including some Tesla shareholders — who follow the mercurial Musk closer than others and are likely familiar with his pathbreaking roles at Tesla and other companies, including SpaceX and the social media app X, formerly known as Twitter.\nOther surveys find similar results. The Democratic polling group Blueprint recently asked men aged 18 to 29 what they think on a variety of issues. When asked about Elon Musk’s endorsement of Trump, 24% said it would make them more likely to vote for Trump and 28% said less likely. Independents, who overlap with swing voters, were slightly more negative toward Musk, with 18% saying his support for Trump makes them more likely to vote for the Republican nominee, and 27% saying less likely.\nIt's not that people. like our Yahoo Finance readers, dislike Musk. In our survey, 45% said he’s a benefit to society, while only 23% said he’s a detriment to society. But 28% agreed that Musk is a visionary entrepreneur who has gotten too rich and powerful.\nMusk helps run at least six companies, and he’s become an outspoken critic of government overreach, “censorship” meant to block offensive online rhetoric, and social-inclusion policies he derides as “wokeness.” On X, Musk frequently reposts conspiracy theories. He's become phone pals with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Conservative commentator William Kristol of the Bulwark calls Musk an “oligarch” trying to gain control of the Republican party and, if Trump wins, the whole US government.\nMusk’s MAGA activism has made him a divisive figure. As a champion of electric vehicles, Musk was a hero to many liberal climate warriors who saw EVs as a vital tool for lowering carbon emissions and battling climate change. Many of the automaker’s early sales were in the Democratic stronghold of California. Musk says he voted for Democrats in the last two presidential elections, Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nBiden snubbed Musk early in his presidency, pointedly declining to invite Musk to events hyping EVs, where General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Jeep parent Stellantis (STLA) led the parade. Tesla has been far ahead of traditional automakers on EVs. But unlike the Detroit Three, Tesla is non-unionized, which is why the pro-union Biden froze Tesla out. Musk began to bash Biden publicly, at one point in 2022 calling him a “damp sock puppet in human form.” Musk may now be seeking revenge for Biden’s snub.\nAmericans increasingly view Musk as a political figure. In a September NBC News poll, Musk’s overall approval rating was 34%. Among Democrats, however, just 6% had a positive view of Musk. Among Republicans, 62% had a positive view. Independents were more negative than the full sample, giving Musk a 31% approval rating.\nIn the Yahoo Finance survey, Tesla shareholders still seem to be Musk fans. Perhaps that's not surprising given that Tesla stock is up by more than 800% during the last five years, with many shareholders making boatloads of money. In our survey, 557 respondents said they were Tesla shareholders. Of those, 54% said Musk is a benefit to society, 9 points higher than the overall sample. Only 13% said he’s a detriment to society, 10 points lower than the broader group.\nWe wondered if Tesla shareholders were irritated with Musk’s foray into politics, and wanted him to get back to running his companies. Some are. Of the Tesla shareholders, 49% said Musk was a welcome new presence in politics, while 41% said he should stick to business. Ten percent said they weren’t sure why Musk was getting into politics.\nMusk has also promoted yet another job for himself if Trump wins: Head of a “government efficiency commission” that would make the government run better. Musk hints that the federal government could use some of the medicine he applied to Twitter after he bought it in 2022, such as slashing staff and loosening rules meant to block lies and offensive content. Many users of the site, now X, complain about rampant propaganda and a pro-Trump bent. X’s value is now a fraction of what Musk paid for it two years ago.\nWe asked the YF audience whether they thought Musk would be able to improve the government if he tried to do so. The overall group was split, with 42% saying Musk would be able to make the government better, and 41% saying he’d make it worse. Twelve percent thought he wouldn’t make a difference, with the rest unsure.\nTesla shareholders were more optimistic, with 48% saying Musk would make the government better, 29% saying he’d make it worse and 15% saying no difference.\nMajorities in both groups suspect self-interest on Musk's part. In the overall group, 61% said Musk would exploit his role in remaking government to benefit his own companies, which face a wide variety of federal regulations. Among Tesla shareholders, 57% thought Musk would use his role as a Trump adviser to benefit his own companies.\nMaybe that’s why some people like the guy: He’s always seeking an edge.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "The signals from Donald Trump and his party at the GOP convention this week painted a mixed picture of what posture the former president would have toward Wall Street and the larger business world if he returns to Washington.\nOn one front, the GOP and Trump are embracing a growing strain of economic populism.\nTrump, for example, invited a union leader to speak on Monday night — unheard of at previous GOP conventions. He also hand-picked as his running mate Sen. JD Vance, whose ascent is built on a stance that differs from traditional GOP orthodoxy on key economic topics like corporate taxes and breaking up Big Tech.\nBut plenty of other signals this week highlighted more of a business-friendly Trump approach to these topics. They marked the continuation of a trend that runs through Trump's nine years in presidential politics as he has alternatively wooed and slammed CEOs.\nTrump, for example, didn't repeat Vance's populist tone when he took the stage Thursday night and instead took time to focus on an issue popular in C-suites: lowering corporate taxes.\nHe extolled the 2017 corporate cuts he signed into law and said they had brought businesses back to America.\n\"We gave you the largest tax cut. We'll do it more,\" Trump said in a tax message to both voters and executives.\nTrump also mused about appointing JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon — Wall Street's biggest name — as Treasury secretary in an interview with Bloomberg that was conducted weeks ago but released this week.\nA source familiar with Dimon's thinking told Yahoo Finance in response to such musings that \"it's highly unlikely that [Dimon] will take a political role\" and that he'll be instead focused on running his bank, the largest in the US.\nAt the moment, Trump is courting the business community intensely.\nHe has gained financial backing from Wall Street figures like Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman and tech titans like Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Musk reportedly could be set to give a whopping $180 million to a Trump-aligned super-PAC before this election season is out.\nThose business world donors appear happy to keep giving, and conversations this week with close observers of how Trump could approach policy in 2025 evinced little worry that the populist posture often seen on stage in Milwaukee will translate into anti-business policies.\n\"Red, Blue, we'll manage just fine,\" Blackstone president Jonathan Gray said in a Yahoo Finance live appearance Thursday.\nGray is a Democratic donor and gave over $50,000 to President Joe Biden's effort but added Thursday \"if there is a movement here towards the Republican side, I'm confident we'll navigate that.\"\nChris Whalen, a strategist and chair of Whalen Global Advisors, was more blunt in a note to Yahoo Finance.\n\"The banking & mortgage industries will be treated well under Trump,\" he wrote, adding that some questions remain, like how the government treats government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But many parameters of how a new Trump administration would approach the financial sector are set.\nIn closed-door fundraisers and before CEOs in recent months, the billionaire Trump has also often espoused his proposal to cut corporate taxes.\nCurrently, the federal corporate tax rate is 21%. Trump wants it lower and has floated a 20% or a 15% rate. Those figures are largely because, as he has said, he's a fan of round numbers.\nIn his discussion of corporate taxes Thursday from the convention stage, Trump said of the cut he enacted in 2017 that companies \"were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country ... the tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great. I changed both of them.\"\nThese dueling messages were present all week in Milwaukee.\nTrump invited the president of the Teamsters union, Sean O'Brien, to address the convention Monday. The Republican candidate was in the room for the speech and looked on approvingly as O'Brien assailed traditional GOP economic policies and added that \"the corporate elite treat us like squatters.\"\nVance followed up by announcing Wednesday night \"we're done, ladies and gentlemen, catering to Wall Street\" while calling top financial leaders \"barons.\"\nVance also has a concrete record that has overlapped with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren on a range of banking issues.\nThe two have been aligned on clawing back the pay of failed bank executives and both share concerns about a decision by regulators to sell the operations of the failed First Republic bank to JPMorgan instead of a smaller regional lender.\nBut on the other hand, Vance also has sizable venture capital and Silicon Valley connections and lived in San Francisco to work in the industry for GOP megadonor Peter Thiel.\nVance also appears to be shifting on some issues. One is a bill that targets Visa and Mastercard. Vance had bucked much of his party and co-sponsored an effort around swipe fees but, according to a recent Politico report, is now not planning to push the bill.\nVance also aligns with Republicans by being skeptical of stricter capital requirements on banks. Those proposed reforms, known as Basel III Endgame, were meant to ensure the stability of the banking system but are expected to undergo significant revisions amid bipartisan criticism this year.\nIn a note this week, Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner advised clients to look at Vance as a symbol of a longer-term shift in the Republican Party.\n\"Reagan Republicans are a dying breed, will have waning influence going forward, and Vance's rise is part of that shift,\" he wrote.\nIn any case, Vance and Trump symbolize a series of crosscurrents likely to be closely watched in the financial world for months to come.\n\"JD, you're going to be doing this for a long time, so enjoy the ride,\" Trump said Thursday of his running mate.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closed over 15% higher Friday and was briefly halted for volatility after Donald Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social.\nTrump, who made the announcement on his Truth Social account, maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $32 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $7 billion, giving the president-elect a stake worth around $4.2 billion.\n\"There are fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth. THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING!\" he wrote in the post, reiterating previous comments of his intention not to sell.\n\"I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities,\" he added. \"Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it.\"\nShares in the company have been on a wild ride over the past week. On Thursday, the stock fell nearly 23% to reverse the gains it enjoyed the day before as Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election.\nWith Friday's moves to the upside, the stock is up 5% over the past five days, although shares have rallied by more than 70% in the past month.\nIn September, shares in Trump Media traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. The stock eventually bounced back from its lows as both domestic and overseas betting markets began to shift in favor of a Trump victory.\nTrump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus.\nAs Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question.\nOn Tuesday, DJT dropped third quarter results after the market close that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period.\nDJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Over the past nine months ending Sept. 30, revenue has fallen 23% from the prior-year period.\nLast month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "For months, Election Day has loomed large for America, as well as Wall Street. Although not everything that happens in the White House or on Capitol Hill has a bearing on the stock market, the votes cast by Americans across our great country ultimately determines who'll be making our laws and shaping our fiscal policy in the years to come.\nWhile the composition of Congress holds great importance, most people tend to focus on who wins the Oval Office. As of 5:42 a.m. ET, based on projections from the Associated Press (AP), former president and Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump has won the presidency.\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »\nAccording to calls made by the AP early Wednesday, Donald Trump holds a 277-to-224 Electoral College vote lead over Vice President and Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Only 270 votes are needed to secure the win.\nThere are, admittedly, some campaign proposals from the former president that have economists and/or investors worried.\nFor example, Trump has proposed implementing tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. to promote domestic production and make American-made goods more price-competitive. More specifically, he's suggested that Chinese imports should face a 60% tariff, with a 20% tariff applied to other nations.\nWhile this proposal may sound great on paper, there's the real risk that tariffs will drive up costs for American consumers and businesses, as well as worsen trade relations with the world's No. 2 economy, China, along with our allies.\nOn the other hand, investors had little to complain about during Trump's first term in the Oval Office. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) respectively gained 56%, 67%, and 138%.\nWith Republicans retaking the Senate and Trump victorious, the prospect of higher taxes for corporate America has been taken off the table. This more than likely paves the way for Wall Street's most influential businesses to continue their aggressive share-repurchase programs.\nHowever, there's an even bigger winner tonight than President-Elect Donald Trump.\nAlthough there are still seven Senate seats and 59 House races left for AP to call at the time of this writing, the undeniable winner of Election Night is Wall Street's investors.\nA little over three years ago, Integrity Wealth Management president and Forbes contributor Mike Patton released a data set that examined the average annual return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1946 through 2020 across various political scenarios. For instance, when Republicans control a majority of seats in the Senate, the Dow generated an average annual return of 11.3%! This is notably higher than the 6.3% average annual return when Democrats held control of the upper house of Congress.\nComparatively, Republican presidents have overseen an average annual return of 7.4% in the Dow over 75 years, which is modestly below the 9% annualized return Democratic presidents have delivered.\nHere's the thing: No matter which party controlled the House, Senate, or White House, Patton's data set showed that average annual returns in the Dow ranged from 6.3% to as high as 12.9%.\nThe analysts at Retirement Researcher looked back even further with their analysis, which examined average annual returns for the S&P 500 from 1926 through 2023. In the 34 years where a Republican was president and Congress was divided between two parties, the S&P 500 averaged a 7.33% annual return. But in the 13 years where Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the White House, the S&P 500 averaged an annual return of 14.52%.\nWhile this data does show that, statistically, certain scenarios have historically been more beneficial to Wall Street than others, the most important takeaway is that stocks can perform well regardless of which party is in power or who wins the White House.\nPerhaps the most telling of all investment studies comes courtesy of Crestmont Research. Every year, Crestmont updates a data set that examines the rolling 20-year total returns, including dividends paid, of the S&P 500, dating back to 1900. Even though the S&P didn't come into existence until 1923, researchers were able to trace its components to other indexes, thusly leading to 105 separate rolling 20-year periods (1919-2023).\nWhat Crestmont Research found was that all 105 of these rolling 20-year periods generated a positive annualized total return. In plainer English, if you had, hypothetically, purchased an S&P 500 tracking index at any point since 1900 and held this position for 20 years, you made money 100% of the time.\nWhat's more, you often made a lot of money. In more than half of the 105 rolling 20-year periods examined, the annualized total return clocked in at or above 9%.\nThough elections are headline news, they get in the way of the real hero for Wall Street investors: time.\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

        "article_content": "The people in Donald Trump’s orbit are floating some dramatic ideas that would remake the way US banks are regulated, from deleting the CFPB to abolishing the FDIC.\nThere are lots of questions about whether any of the ideas, some of which would require acts of Congress, will come to pass.\nBut what is clear is that certain members of the new Trump administration who are set to take office do in fact want a different regulatory approach to the financial services industry as they look to remake the federal government and slash spending.\nAnd that could mean lighter scrutiny, fewer rules, and perhaps less onerous requirements.\nThere are several early signs. One came from billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk, who is leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.\nHis suggestion last month made on X was to \"delete the CFPB\" — a reference to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency created after the 2008 financial crisis that has clashed with banks repeatedly.\n\"There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies,\" Musk said in his Nov. 27 post.\nAnother sign emerged this past week with a report in The Wall Street Journal of Trump advisers and officials from Musk’s DOGE asking potential regulatory nominees whether Trump could abolish the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and then move its deposit insurance function to the Treasury Department.\nThe FDIC currently acts as a backstop for money held by customers at thousands of US banks, insuring those deposits up to a level of $250,000 per account.\nRead more: What is the FDIC, and how does it work?\nThere have also been discussions, according to the Journal report, about combining the FDIC with the two other agencies that oversee banks: the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).\nAbolishing the FDIC (or the CFPB) would require an act of Congress, so some observers view either possibility as remote.\n\"Eliminating the FDIC is so out there,\" said former FDIC chair Sheila Bair on X, and thus she was “not sure it needs response.”\n“FDIC has a perfect record of protecting insured deposits for over 90 years,\" added Bair, who was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush. \"Strong consumer confidence in the brand, providing stability during crises.”\nJust last year, in fact, the FDIC stepped in and absorbed the uninsured deposits of some sizable regional banks that failed, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\nBut there are plenty of people who operate within the banking and regulatory worlds who argue that some restructuring of these agencies is needed.\nFormer FDIC chair Bill Isaac, who was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, said in a proposal last April that the current bank regulatory system is \"complicated, inefficient, and badly broken.\"\n\"Our current bank regulatory system is the result of over two centuries of ad hoc 'Band-Aid' fixes to solve specific historical problems and crises, rather than overhauling the system with a design that will work long-term.\"\nIsaac told Yahoo Finance he doesn’t believe the FDIC should be involved in the daily supervision of banks but warned against its outright elimination.\n“I think it would be a serious mistake, and I feel very strongly about that. It's the banking system’s fail-safe,” Isaac said.\nFormer FDIC examiner Allen Puwalski on Friday also called for a renovation of bank supervision and regulation in a new LinkedIn post.\n“At present our bank oversight system is inefficient and regularly ineffective,\" Puwalski wrote.\nPuwalski, who is also a board member at New York regional bank Flagstar (FLG), suggested in his post that all bank supervision should be moved from the Fed and FDIC to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The FDIC, he added, should go back to its original mission as a deposit insurer — as opposed to a bank supervisor.\nHe does not share the view that the FDIC should be abolished altogether.\n\"It’s simply too big a lift to eliminate the FDIC,\" he said on LinkedIn. \"It can’t get done.\"\nAdvocates for big changes to the way banks are regulated could have some allies in Congress, which will be under GOP control starting in January.\nA former banker, Rep. French Hill, was selected this week to lead the House Financial Services Committee. His agenda that was circulated before he got the post called for less stringent rules applying to regional banks.\nHe doesn’t want as many banks subject to CFPB oversight, according to that agenda, and wants bank agencies to review \"the cumulative impact of their regulations.\"\nA spokesperson for Sen. Tim Scott, who is likely to become the Republican chair of the Senate Banking Committee next year, said: \"Scott has been clear in his concerns with the federal banking agencies, including recent supervisory failures and abuses of authority.\"\nScott, the spokesperson added, \"looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to find solutions to streamline regulation, reduce red tape, and increase efficiency while ensuring the continued stability of our financial system.\"\nBut Republicans will also have slim majorities in the House and Senate, making any dramatic reforms more difficult to pull off.\nDemocrats would likely resist efforts to take power from the regulatory agencies, although their party did eliminate the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) after the 2008 financial meltdown.\nTrump allies may also turn their attention to other agencies that have a bearing on what banks do, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWall Street’s top cop will be led by Paul Atkins, who is expected to be friendlier to Wall Street and to the world of crypto. He replaces Gary Gensler, who has clashed repeatedly with some of the biggest players in cryptocurrencies — and with Musk.\nMusk said on X Thursday that the SEC demanded he agree within 48 hours to pay a fine related to a probe of his 2022 purchase of the social media platform then known as Twitter.\n“Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?” Musk said in his post.\nEarlier in the day, Musk, in a separate post, called the SEC \"just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.\"\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "With Donald Trump's second term as President of the United States, the hotel and hospitality sectors are poised for several shifts.\nDrawing on policies from his first term and early indications of his second, we explore the potential opportunities and challenges facing the industry under his leadership.\nTrump’s administration has long advocated for tax cuts and pro-business economic policies, which could be advantageous for the hospitality sector.\nLower corporate taxes and a continued push for deregulation are expected to provide significant relief for hotel owners and operators.\nThese policies can lead to increased disposable income for consumers and enhanced corporate travel budgets, potentially boosting hotel occupancy and revenue streams.\nMoreover, Trump’s focus on stimulating economic growth could foster a favourable environment for both domestic and international travel. With the economy likely to experience a boost, the demand for hotel rooms — particularly for business travel and tourism — is expected to rise.\nThis will be particularly relevant as the hospitality industry works to recover from the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring his first term, Trump placed significant emphasis on enhancing the country’s infrastructure, a trend likely to continue during his second term.\nThis could include improvements to airports, roadways, and public transportation systems — all of which are crucial for the hospitality industry.\nThe more seamless travel experience facilitated by these upgrades will encourage more tourists and business travellers to visit the U.S., benefiting hotels across the country.\nFurthermore, Trump’s administration is expected to focus on trade agreements that can stimulate international travel to the United States. This could lead to greater numbers of overseas visitors, who will be drawn by favourable trade relations, improved diplomatic ties, and lower tariffs.\nThese factors are likely to benefit the hotel industry, particularly in major tourist destinations such as New York, Los Angeles, and Orlando, which rely heavily on international tourism.\nOne of the most anticipated outcomes of Trump’s second term is the continuation of deregulation, which could reduce the compliance burden on hotel operators.\nEasing restrictions on workforce management, tax codes, and operational oversight would offer greater flexibility for hotel owners and developers. This could potentially lower operational costs, allowing for increased profitability and the ability to reinvest in property upgrades or new developments.\nWith fewer regulatory hurdles, the hotel industry could also see a surge in new projects and renovations.\nReal estate developers may find it easier to invest in new properties, both in the form of new hotel developments and renovations of existing facilities, leading to an expansion of the US hotel market.\nSmaller hotel chains may also benefit, as the business-friendly climate encourages innovation and new market entrants.\nUnder Trump’s first administration, the hotel industry faced challenges stemming from restrictive visa policies that limited travel from certain countries.\nThis aspect of Trump’s presidency could return in his second term, potentially impacting U.S. tourism numbers. Policies like the “travel ban” from his first term could be reinstated, which may cause uncertainty in the international travel sector.\nWhile this may limit the flow of visitors from specific regions, Trump's administration may focus on other aspects of global diplomacy, which could still promote tourism.\nChanges to visa policies, increased security measures, and a greater emphasis on immigration scrutiny could lead to a more selective flow of international tourists, which would particularly affect hotels relying on long-haul visitors from regions such as the Middle East and Africa.\nTrump's second term presents both opportunities and challenges for the hotel and hospitality industry.\nWhile pro-business policies and infrastructure improvements are likely to foster growth and innovation, there are concerns around the potential impact of restrictive immigration policies and the rollback of environmental initiatives.\nThe next four years could see a period of recalibration, with the hotel sector adapting to new regulatory environments and capitalising on opportunities created by a robust economy and a thriving domestic travel market.\nWhile much remains uncertain, one thing is clear: the hospitality industry will need to stay agile to navigate the evolving political and economic landscape under the Trump administration.\n\"Trump’s presidency and the path ahead for hospitality\" was originally created and published by Hotel Management Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n \nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

The stock split the difference by the end of the day and closed at $17.97 for a gain of 11.97% on the day.\nEven with the boost, the stock remains far below its 52-week high of $79.38 as Trump was romping through the GOP primary season. All told, the stock ended the week largely flat after falling earlier in the week following Trump’s weaker-than-expected debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris.\nBut the stock has tumbled in recent weeks as Trump returned to the X platform, where he has over 90 million followers. Most recently, the stock sank to new lows after Tuesday's debate, which swung bets toward Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris to win the election.\nTrump owns 60% of his company's shares but has been subject to a lockup period and has been unable to sell his stake in the company during this period.\nThat ends next week on Sept. 19, when the GOP nominee could potentially begin to sell and gain access to what could be a multibillion-dollar windfall but one that, in Trump’s own words, has been “whittled down” in recent months.\nThe moves have indeed cost Trump and pushed him off the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index of the world's 500 richest people.\nThe idea behind a lock-up period is to protect a newly public company's interests and allow it to preserve stability before its founders can cash out.\n“If I sell, it wouldn’t be the same and I can understand that,” Trump added Friday on the potential effect if he began to sell shares.\nThis post has been updated.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Tech executives may be warming to Donald Trump’s return to the White House as his quick win sparks optimism for more spending and dealmaking.\n“Business does a lot better when uncertainty goes away,” IBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance’s Invest conference. “We are hopeful that there is going to be a lot more innovation and less regulation. Those are both good for businesses across the board.”\nKrishna believes a lighter regulatory environment will prompt clients to make investment decisions more quickly and also lay the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment.\n“If we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A … If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,” Krishna added.\nA shift toward less regulation would be a dramatic change for the industry, which has faced intense scrutiny from the Biden administration. Under FTC Chair Lina Khan’s leadership, regulators aggressively pursued cases against the industry’s biggest companies, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\nTrump, on the other hand, has promised to cut excess red tape, including his promise to throw out Biden’s executive order aimed at putting safety guardrails on AI — a move that would be viewed as controversial by those within the industry.\nWhile Trump’s antitrust agendas remain uncertain, there seems to be growing optimism that he'll employ a more hands-off approach compared to Biden.\n“We expect tech stocks to rally further into year-end as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump with Khan/FTC days in the rear view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to clients.\nCisco (CSCO) CFO Scott Herren is confident in the company’s momentum heading into 2025. He told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts that he feels “really good” about Cisco’s position, noting “strength across the board.”\n“It's hard to predict what's going to happen from a political standpoint, but when you look at the things that are going to drive government efficiency, we've got the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that's about increasing productivity, and technology is always going to be critical to increasing productivity,” Herren said.\nDespite optimism from tech leaders, investor sentiment seems a bit more cautious. Performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks, outside of Tesla (TSLA), has been lackluster since Election Day, hampered by risks associated with a stronger dollar and more tariffs.\nThat could change quickly, Defiance ETFs CEO Sylvia Jablonski told me. AI, which has “essentially been all the rage” on Wall Street, remains in its “infancy,” with vast growth potential ahead, he said.\nAnd IBM’s Krishna echoed this sentiment, citing AI as a key catalyst not only for IBM’s stock but the US tech sector overall.\n“AI spending from our clients is going to increase ... And automation spending is going to go up … I think that there is going to be more of an appetite for US technology globally,” Krishna said. “There’s going to be a lot more appetite to go invest in US technology from all over the globe.”\nSince the start of the year, IBM shares have climbed more than 25%, outpacing the Nasdaq 100's (^NDX) 20% jump.\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

The dizzying array of pledges include his calls for fully extending his 2017 tax cuts with modifications and an array of add-ons such as eliminating taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security benefits.\nThe family caregiver focus on Sunday night from Trump is an echo of a long-term care plan that Kamala Harris unveiled earlier this month. And beyond that, the former president's ideas expand into ones that would upend the IRS entirely.\nIn a recent podcast appearance with Joe Rogan, Trump doubled down on an idea he has toyed with for months to eliminate income taxes entirely because, in his view, tariffs will bring in so much revenue.\n\"Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs? Are we serious about that?\" the podcast host asked Trump.\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Trump responded. \"Why not?\"\nEconomists say Trump’s math doesn’t add up with tariffs currently contributing less than 2% of federal revenue and the idea seen as unlikely to gain traction outside of the ultraconservative side of the Republican caucus on Capitol Hill.\nAnd what Trump also hasn't offered among his dozen promises — outside of sky high promises about the revenue he would bring in from tariffs and oil drilling — are ways to pay for them.\nThe closest thing to a total tab comes from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). It finds that Trump's tax promises could cost over $9 trillion in the next decade.\nBut that tally doesn't include the idea of eliminating income taxes entirely — not to mention the caregiver credit or other recent plans to make car loan interest fully deductible or another recently promised cut cut for Americans who live abroad.\nHarris, of course, has her own tax cut ideas, but the sheer scale of Trump's promises are notable.\nTrump is also promising one significant tax hike (though he'd never call it that) in the form of those tariffs that experts say could add thousands to US family budgets. Tariffs are taxes that are paid by importers at US points of entry, with the additional costs often passed on to consumers.\nThe list of tax cuts unfurled during the campaign has been met with a combination of shock and dismissive eye-rolls from tax experts, but the critics have done little to dissuade him from unveiling new proposals regularly and dangling the promised new benefits directly to the groups of voters most interested.\nHere's a quick pass through Trump's many promises and the many challenges they would face before becoming law:\nMany of Trump's ideas are clearly intended to appeal directly to blocs he needs to win in November.\n\"Do we have any people that work in restaurants?\" he asked a recent crowd in Reading, Pa., before reiterating his promise of no tax on tips. Likewise, his recent auto loan idea was unveiled in Motor City, aka Detroit.\nWhen the audience includes seniors, his focus switches to removing taxes on Social Security benefits. Trump's plan there would cut into the program's funding source and has led to worry it could produce an even faster decline in the safety net program.\nIndeed, these targeted proposals have, in addition to their cost, also been criticized by economists for potentially warping incentives if, say, the tips or overtime are not taxed but regular wages are.\nA recent analysis from the Budget Lab at Yale focused on how implementing these ideas would heighten \"horizontal inequities\" in the tax system. In other words, two people making the same amount of gross pay could pay vastly different taxes depending on whether their compensation does or does not include tips or overtime.\nDemocrats have been even less kind. \"These tax proposals he's floating out of desperation are as fake as his tan,\" Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden offered in a statement. \"Trump knows Republicans in Congress have no intention of passing this stuff, but he goes ahead and blurts it out anyway.\nTrump has weighed in on the key 2024 issue of housing affordability by unveiling a GOP platform that promises to \"promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers.\" That's an idea the CRFB estimates could cost between $100 and $350 billion if enacted.\nTrump's promise is to make interest on car loans would function similarly to the current mortgage interest deduction for homeowners.\n\"We're going to make it fully deductible, the interest payments,\" Trump said while unveiling the idea, saying it would revolutionize the auto industry and comparing the idea to the invention of the paper clip.\nTrump's other new promise is a pledge to eliminate \"double taxation\" for Americans living overseas.\n\"You have to make sure that you are registered and you are going to vote, because I'm going to take very good care of you,\" Trump promised that audience in a web video.\nTrump has also made a wide array of promises directly linked to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Those tax changes that Trump himself signed into law came with an expiration date on major provisions at the end of 2025.\nThe GOP nominee is pledging to fully extend expiring provisions of those tax cuts. It's his most expensive promise and one that he repeats at nearly every campaign stop but one that his allies on Capitol Hill may be shifting away from.\nThat 2017 law also lowered the federal corporate tax rate to 21%. Trump now wants it even lower and has settled on 15%, calling it a \"Made in America tax credit.\" It's a rate he previously worried privately was too low and another front where his party might not be fully behind him.\nTrump has also pledged to reverse a separate provision of the 2017 law that put a $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. That cap was included at the time to help offset some other costs but is deeply unpopular in coastal — and often Democratic-run — states with higher local taxes.\nTrump unveiled that idea in (where else) New York, where anti-SALT sentiment runs deep. He repeatedly the promise during a second New York stop, promising it again during remarks at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in Manhattan.\nFinally, Trump has teased additional unspecified cuts \"for working families\" as part of next year's tax negotiations but hasn't offered any additional details there.\nIt all adds up to a massive slate of pledges that pushes the bounds of even presidential campaign trail promises.\nAnd is Trump even done? That remains to be seen with just a few days remaining until voting ends and plenty of campaign stops ahead and other ideas are definitely out there.\nDuring a recent podcast interview, George \"Tyrus\" Murdoch floated the idea to Trump of eliminating taxes for veterans and police officers and others who serve.\nTrump sounded intrigued, offering \"I've never heard that before\" calling it an \"interesting thing.\"\nAnother big possibility: an expansion of the child tax credit that Harris has made a centerpiece of her campaign and GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance has expressed support for expanding.\nEver since Vance's August comment Trump has been, according to aides, considering getting behind \"a significant expansion\" there.\nThis post has been updated with additional developments.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how U.S. policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "title": "Trump likely to roll back but not dismantle Biden's clean energy spending",
        "date": "2024-11-11T16:00:34.000Z",
        "article_content": "As a candidate, Donald Trump denounced clean energy spending tied to the Biden administration’s sweeping climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). At his speech before the Economic Club of New York in September, he called the legislation the “greatest scam in history.”\nYet, as the president-elect prepares to return to the White House in January, he faces pressure to keep the law largely intact from lawmakers in his own party, none of whom voted for the IRA.\n“About 75% of the job creation and the capital spending on new manufacturing and other clean energy resources has gone to red states or red counties in blue states,” said James West, senior managing director at Evercore ISI. “So we don't expect a whole lot to come from a new administration.”\nThe perception that there could be a wholesale shift in energy policy sent clean energy stocks lower in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s election. Solar panels and equipment manufacturers First Solar (FSLR) and Enphase (ENPH) plummeted, while the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) declined 11% Wednesday.\nWest said trade volumes surged threefold the day after the presidential election, leading to “total chaos.” That knee-jerk reaction fails to recognize the scope of the largest climate investment in US history and the nuances of a potential impact, he said.\nIn a recent note to clients, West warned investors against lumping all clean energy plays together, saying “different segments of the clean energy economy face different degrees of Trump-related risks.”\nThe 2022 legislation unleashed billions of dollars in grants, loans, and tax provisions to accelerate the US transition to clean energy over 10 years. In total, the Biden administration committed more than $350 billion to projects aimed at reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions, with the goal of halving 2005 emissions levels by the end of this decade.\nWhile no Republican lawmaker voted to pass the law, their constituents have overwhelmingly benefited from the provisions tied to clean energy investments.\nAccording to data from the Department of Energy, $10.8 billion in investments in solar energy have gone to red states, while just $4.1 billion have gone to blue states. And $35 billion tied to electric vehicle spending has gone to Republican districts, while $22 billion has gone to Democratic ones.\nRescinding money that has already been allocated would require congressional approval. At least 18 Republican lawmakers have already warned House Speaker Mike Johnson against repealing the IRA, making a complete reversal unlikely.\nBut Johnson has also suggested he would use a “scalpel and not a sledgehammer” to amend the law.\nBob Keefe, executive director of the nonpartisan advocacy group E2, said he was worried that Republicans would push to impose new expiration dates for tax law written with a 10-year time frame in mind. About a third of the money allocated by the IRA hasn’t gone out the door yet, he said.\n“We know that Congress controls the purse strings, and they can defund anything they want, or they can defund a lot,” said Keefe, who consulted on the IRA. “Under the president's direction, the agencies can do a lot of damage as well. I think that the Trump administration, if they do what they say they're going to do, will most certainly and unfortunately slow the growth of clean energy.”\nElectric vehicles, which make up a large part of the investments allocated by the IRA, could be an easy target, including the $7,500 tax credit for new vehicles.\nTrump would have “considerable scope to make regulatory changes” without congressional approval, West said. That includes tightening restrictions around rules of origin, where parts and components are sourced from, and weakening EPA tailpipe emissions rules for carmakers.\nTrump has also expressed a desire to halt all offshore wind development, though those projects make up a small portion of all IRA investments. At a rally in May, he vowed to stop all projects on “day one” through executive order.\nSolar power faces its own risk, not from changes to the IRA but from the 60% tariffs Trump has proposed on all goods and services imported from China. China dominates the market for polysilicon wafers and other critical components used in solar modules.\nRegardless of technology, Keefe said changes to climate policy could have a significant impact on jobs.\nA recent survey E2 conducted with BW research found that more than half of clean energy companies said they would lose business or revenue as a direct result of an IRA repeal. More than 20% said they would be forced to lay off employees in an industry that employs 3.46 million Americans, according to E2.\nDespite those concerns, Keefe and West said the US energy landscape has fundamentally shifted over the last few years, in part because of the advancement of artificial intelligence.\nThe decision between clean energy and fossil fuels is no longer a binary choice, especially with the massive need for power at data centers that drive AI. Goldman Sachs estimates that power demand at data centers alone will grow 160% by 2030.\nThat suggests that Trump would not “meaningfully undercut” renewables development, West said.\n“We think Mr. Trump should have a hard time saying ‘no’ to major new sources coming on the grid,” he added.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-12-31T11:25:32.000Z",
        "article_content": "One thing President-elect Donald Trump can probably count on next year is falling oil prices, thanks to growing global supply.\n“Demand is not the primary concern as global oil demand growth is expected to slow from 1.3 million barrels per day this year to 1.1 mbd next year ... Instead, the real challenge lies in the excess supply,” Natasha Kaneva, head of the Global Commodities Strategy team at JPMorgan, wrote in a recent note.\nKaneva and her team predict Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, which is on track to average roughly $80 for 2024, will tumble to an average of $73 in 2025.\nThe analysts point to incoming supply from large-scale offshore developments in Brazil, Guyana, Senegal, and Norway.\nBrent crude futures (BZ=F) rose to $74.60 a barrel on Tuesday and US West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) was up at $71.66 a barrel. For the year, Brent declined 3.2%, while WTI was down 0.1%.\nMeanwhile, BofA analysis shows prices could drop to an average of $65 per barrel in 2025, particularly if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decides to bring barrels back onto the market, a move the oil alliance has repeatedly delayed this year.\n\"Oil is not going to be in short supply, so we keep more of a bearish stance on oil [in 2025],\" Francisco Blanch, head of Bank of America's global commodities and derivatives research, said earlier this month.\nWall Street's forecasts bode well for Trump’s intention to lower the price of energy through deregulation, among other things. “We'll soon unleash American energy. And this will be done at levels not seen before, issuing quick approvals for pipelines, drilling, and other infrastructure,” Trump said at a recent press conference.\nThe US already provides roughly 20% of the world's oil, more than any other country.\nGrowing domestic and foreign supply will likely cap any upward price shocks.\n“There’s a much much larger risk of a big price drop to $50 or $60 than there is to something like the $80+ range,\" Tom Kloza, OPIS global head of energy analysis told Yahoo Finance. \"It would take something on the order of the Russian invasion of Ukraine or a wider mid-Eastern war to really send prices back up to the 2022 or 2023 highs.”\nSome analysts point out crude futures could move higher if Trump imposes US sanctions against Iran or Venezuela. But JPMorgan's Kaneva believes the incoming president will ultimately opt to keep oil prices low to avoid inflation catalysts.\n\"Any policies that might raise oil price will likely take a backseat to Trump’s key objective of maintaining low energy prices,\" she wrote to clients.\nDespite the downtrend in prices, the impact on energy costs will likely vary from Trump's promises during his campaign.\n“Energy is going to bring us back. That means we’re going down and getting gasoline below $2 a gallon,\" then-candidate Trump said at the Economic Club of New York in September.\nRead more: Best credit cards for gas for December 2024\nAnalysts don't see those types of declines.\n\"What's nearly guaranteed: we will not see pandemic era sub-$2 per gallon prices unless there is economic calamity,\" GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan told Yahoo Finance recently.\nHowever, the market could see a continuation of year-over-year trends showing a decline from their peak in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. The Energy Information Administration expects prices at the pump to average $3.20 per gallon next year, about $0.10 lower than in 2024.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Pariah, no more.\nDonald Trump was the scourge of corporate America after the Jan.6, 2021, riots at the US Capitol. Social media companies such as Facebook and Google suspended Trump’s accounts. Dozens of big corporate donors stopped giving to politicians aligned with Trump. The PGA canceled a golf tournament scheduled at a Trump course.\nNearly four years later, the prodigal son is the surprise toast of the banquet. As Trump heads for a second presidential term, business titans are lining up like supplicants vying for an audience with the king. It’s a singular moment of triumph for a 78-year-old man who has sought approval from the billionaire class for most of his working life.\nFormer Trump antagonists Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Jeff Bezos of Amazon plan to give $1 million each to Trump’s inaugural fund, as does Sundar Pichai of Google. Bezos and at least 15 other business leaders are due to meet with Trump this week.\nMasayoshi Son, CEO of Japanese investing giant Softbank, appeared with Trump during his Dec. 16 press conference to announce a $100 billion investment in the United States during the next four years. The week before, execs from Visa, Meta, Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab, and Citadel reportedly joined Trump backstage when he rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. And Trump’s inner circle now includes Tesla CEO Elon Musk plus the new MAGA wing of Silicon Valley.\nWhat do they all want?\nInfluence, for sure. Trump arrived on the political scene in 2016 as a maverick many people thought would quickly flame out. His first term was an experiment in disruption, with many of Trump’s most controversial actions blocked by courts or left unfulfilled in a conflicted Congress. Had Trump lost in 2024, corporate America would have happily reverted to business as usual.\nNow, however, the disrupters are in charge. And Trump’s habit of delegating authority to loyalists and supporters demonstrates the rewards that can accrue to those who join the Trump cause, even if they’re latecomers.\nMusk suddenly enjoys outsized influence with Trump, thanks to his late-breaking support in the 2024 election. Musk and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will run Trump’s government-efficiency commission, which can’t make changes on its own, but can draw up blueprints for Trump to act on through executive action or submit to Congress as legislation. Trump’s vice presidential choice, JD Vance, is a favorite of Peter Thiel and other libertarian tech billionaires. Vance is already the likely GOP presidential candidate in 2028, which means Trumpy tech titans could have the president’s ear for years to come.\nThere’s a lot at stake in Trump’s economic agenda, with direct implications for the companies run by his new suitors. Trump is likely to cut regulations and approve more corporate mergers, perhaps with special favors for certain sectors or companies. There’s been simmering interest for years in the question of whether tech companies are too big and powerful and ought to be broken up or reined in. With Republicans in full control of Congress and the White House, tech CEOs can’t afford to be on the outside looking in.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nMusk’s effort to remake the government could affect hundreds of companies across the economy. The government has manifold agencies that regulate nearly every corner of the economy in some way, from healthcare to aviation to workplace safety. Every company would love a say in how the government regulates it. Then there are the thousands of government contractors that could benefit or suffer based on whether Musk’s commission potentially deems their contracts a value for taxpayers or reckless spending.\nCEOs also learned from Trump’s first term that it’s prudent to stay out of Trump’s crosshairs. The supposedly business-friendly president publicly attacked a number of companies, some because he perceived a personal offense, others because they were moving jobs overseas or acting too \"woke\" for Trump’s tastes. Those attacks sometimes functioned as de facto boycotts because Trump’s supporters went after the companies as well. A Trump attack avoided is certainly better than doing damage control after one of Trump’s broadsides. Some CEOs may feel that alone is worth a few flattering words or a timely donation.\nCEOs may also be looking around Washington, D.C., and concluding that Trump is the only game in town. President Joe Biden is hobbling from office as a shrunken figure forced to withdraw from the presidential race by his own frailty. His replacement, Vice President Kamala Harris, couldn’t beat a convicted felon once broadly reviled. Their party got smoked across the board in the 2024 elections. Democrats could be in exile for years.\nAligning with Trump could still backfire if the once and future president does something so odious that the voters who sent him back to the White House in 2024 turn on him. But one lesson of 2024 seems to be that Americans have a high tolerance for Trumpy dystopia.\nMaybe CEOs should too.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered what was perhaps a tell Wednesday on how top of mind the economic policies of President-elect Donald Trump are for monetary policy in 2025.\nThe moment came about 15 minutes into his press conference with reporters when he was asked about September 2018 \"Tealbook\" simulations from the central bank on tariffs.\n“I happen to have brought them with me here today,” Powell offered of the long-ago study, which discussed the impact of tariffs during Trump 1.0 on prices and whether it was possible to \"look through\" their effects.\n\"They’re a good starting point,\" Powell added of the six-year-old analysis, calling the questions the right ones to ask.\nThe moment was emblematic of Powell's current approach of preparing for Trump's policies but not changing course just yet.\nFor now, Powell and his colleagues Wednesday decided in a split vote to reduce the central bank's benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a new range of 4.25%-4.5%, initiating its third consecutive rate cut of 2024 despite signs that inflation isn’t entirely going away.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nTariffs are of course a central question about what Trump 2.0 may entail for the economy, with the president-elect pledging a potential wave of new trade wars on China and other trading partners both during the campaign and in the weeks since his victory.\nA range of economists have offered predictions that new tariffs — as well as immigration moves — could be inflationary and pose new challenges for the central bank.\nPowell repeatedly underlined Wednesday that there are more questions than answers at this point on what policies Trump will actually put into place as he acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding what effects such policies may have on the Fed’s rate path.\n\"We expect significant policy changes,\" Powell said. \"We need to see what they are and what effects they have. We will have a much clearer picture\" once that happens.\nThe Fed, he added, is \"thinking about these questions\" but won’t have definitive answers for some time yet.\nThis mix of planning but not yet necessarily reacting is one that many experts, including at least one former regional Fed president, expected.\nFor now, Powell is clearly studying up on what effects different tariffs and other scenarios could have. \"I think that’s the right tack,” said former Cleveland Fed boss Loretta Mester in a live Yahoo Finance interview on Wednesday just before the decision.\n\"We may know a lot more once the inaugural happens,\" she added.\nFor now, Powell is clearly studying up on what effects different tariff and other scenarios could have.\nHe said he and his colleagues have been doing “a good bit of work” on how tariffs might impact inflation.\n\"It puts us in position, when we finally do see what the actual policies are, to make a more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy path.\"\n\"You don’t rule anything in or out in this world,\" he added about the path for the economy in 2025.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how US policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "article_content": "Seniors would face heftier cuts to their Social Security benefits sooner than expected if Donald Trump wins the presidential election and his campaign promises are implemented, a new analysis found.\nThe reserve fund for Social Security would run empty by 2031 instead of the current estimate of 2034 if Trump's tax breaks, tariffs, and mass deportations are imposed, according to a new report from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB).\nAt that time, Social Security benefits would be cut by 30% to 31%, reaching 33% by 2035. If Social Security remains on the current trajectory, the reduction would be 23% by 2035.\n\"Social Security is nine years from insolvency, and neither campaign has a plan to solve it,\" said Marc Goldwein, a senior policy director for CRFB, a nonpartisan public policy organization. \"But President Trump's plans would make it much, much worse.\"\nThough not considered in this report, Goldwein also added that the policies would hurt Medicare's funding as well. Payroll taxes, specifically FICA taxes, fund both Social Security and Medicare.\nWhile there are real questions if all these policies would be enacted should Trump win a second term, simply adding to existing concerns over Social Security's solvency could be enough to drive people to make poorer financial decisions.\n\"It’s beyond irresponsible, toying with people’s retirement,\" Laurence Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University and an expert on Social Security. \"We already have too many people taking benefits too early, forfeiting hundreds of thousands of dollars in benefits.\"\nRead more: Do you pay taxes on Social Security?\nThe report considered Trump's promises to get rid of taxes on Social Security benefits, tips, and overtime as well as his vow to deport undocumented immigrants and impose a 10% to 20% tariff on imported goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\nBy not taxing Social Security benefits — which directly go to Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds — Social Security would lose $950 billion, the analysis found.\nAnother $900 billion would be lost to the elimination of taxes on overtime and tips, the former of which is subject to FICA taxes and the latter must be reported at tax time.\nThe tariffs and deportations would reduce the money going to Social Security by $400 billion. In total, that's $2.25 trillion less than would be collected under current law.\nGoldwein noted that tariffs increase Social Security spending because tariffs increase prices, boosting inflation. Benefits are indexed to inflation, so they would also increase with consumer prices. The Social Security Administration would then have to pay out more in benefits.\nUndocumented immigrants also add to Social Security's coffers, Goldwein said.\n\"The vast majority of undocumented immigrants are of working age. Many of them work in jobs where they pay taxes either because they gain some legal status after they've gotten here, or they write down a random Social Security number,\" he said.\n\"Either way, they're paying into the Social Security program.\"\nIn fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the recent surge in immigrants is expected to bring in $348 billion in Social Security taxes over the 2024–2034 period. The CRFB report assumes this would be reduced to $100 billion to $150 billion under Trump's immigration policies.\nWhile the report only focuses on Social Security, Medicare would also be threatened, said Goldwein, who noted that he might do an additional analysis on that.\nRight now, the reserves that Medicare uses for hospital coverage — known as Medicare Part A — are expected to run out in 2036. Eliminating just the taxes on Social Security benefits would move up that date to 2030.\nAdd in the other tax breaks, tariffs, and deportations, and \"those extra should make it even more severe,\" Goldwein said. \"Medicare would likely be insolvent before 2030 under these proposals.\"\nThe Medicare trustees have previously said the fund's insolvency could first cause delays in payments to health plans and hospitals. Additionally, seniors' \"access to healthcare services could rapidly be curtailed.\"\nThe severity of Social Security cuts would differ by income. The report found that about half of beneficiaries would see the full 33% cut — typically those with lower incomes who don't pay taxes on benefits now. In 2024, an individual with income below $25,000 does not have to pay taxes on their benefits. That amount is $32,000 for a married couple filing jointly.\nSeniors with just enough income to pay taxes would see a 30% cut to their benefits, while those with $100,000 in annual income in retirement would experience a 26% reduction. The very highest income retirees would only see a 3% nick off their benefits.\nThe cuts are regressive partly because the tax on Social Security benefits is progressive, meaning people are taxed more if they have higher incomes. Those with the top incomes would see a tax break that would largely offset the cut in their benefits.\n\"Those who are impacted, the majority of them are in the middle class,\" said Emmanuel Eliason, a certified financial planner in Centennial, Colo. \"So less money in the pocket means that their lifestyle may have to be adjusted.\"\nRead more: How to find out your 2025 Social Security COLA increase\nFor those who rely on Social Security for the majority of their income, a cut like this could be devastating, said Monica Dwyer, senior vice president at Harvest Financial Advisors in West Chester, Ohio.\n\"It will increase the need for government aid such as affordable housing, Medicaid, and other social services, and it will likely mean more homelessness than we have ever seen,\" she said.\nJust the threat of steeper Social Security reductions could hurt people's financial planning.\nA survey last year from asset management company Schroders found that the top reason workers said they plan to take benefits before 70 is because they're concerned Social Security could stop paying out before they reach that age.\nBut if they wait until 70, their benefits would be larger — 8% more every year past full retirement age. Many experts encourage people to wait as long as possible to claim to get the bigger benefit.\n\"Sometimes the fear about whether Social Security is going to be available encourages people to make bad Social Security decisions,\" Dwyer said. \"I am very concerned that [the effect of Trump's proposals] will make people’s irrational thinking worse.\"\nJanna Herron is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman has said he expects Donald Trump to privatize two of the nation’s biggest government-owned mortgage lenders.\nThe Trump-supporting financier said he believes the president-elect will remove lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — formally the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation — from conservatorship during his second administration, he wrote in a post on X.\nThe move would potentially make them private companies again, which Ackman said would generate “$300 billion of additional profits to the federal government” if successful.\nAckman, a major shareholder of Fannie Mae, said there is a “credible path” to remove the companies from conservatorship in the next two years with Trump at the helm.\n“During Trump’s first term, Secretary Mnuchin took steps toward this outcome, but he ran out of time,” Ackman said. “I expect that in the second @realDonaldTrump administration, Trump and his team will get the job done.”\n“Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history,” Ackman added. “I am confident he will get it done.”\nHe conceded that there remains “a high degree of uncertainty” about the ultimate outcome in a warning to his followers.\nAfter Ackman’s post, shares of both companies enjoyed a boost, with Fannie Mae rising 18.4 percent and Freddie Mac up 18 percent. The companies are two of the biggest backers of mortgages in the U.S.\nFollowing the housing market collapse in the 2008 crash, the companies suffered huge losses and were placed in conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nAckman is a Trump ally who previously celebrated the president-elect’s proposals to introduce trade tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada by 25 percent.\n“To be clear, according to Trump the 25% tariffs will not be implemented, or if implemented will be removed, once Mexico and Canada stop the flow of illegal immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.,” Ackman wrote on X after the announcement.\n“In other words, @realDonaldTrump is going to use tariffs as a weapon to achieve economic and political outcomes which are in the best interest of America, fulfilling his  America first policy.”"

        "article_content": "The contest for Treasury secretary is emerging as a key stumbling block in Donald Trump's presidential transition as candidates rise and fall by the day and top advisers make their arguments before millions of followers.\nLast week, the top contenders appeared to be Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management investing chief.\nBut the water is now murkier than ever after a weekend of even more intense back-and-forth unlike anything surrounding Trump's other picks so far.\n\"Would be interesting to hear more people weigh in on this,\" Elon Musk even asked his 200+ million followers on social media platform X on Saturday before making his own views clear.\n\"My view fwiw is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas [Lutnick] will actually enact change.\"\nBut even Musk hasn't been able to put an end to the debate, with Bessent still being pushed by prominent backers in Trump's orbit but new contenders apparently now in consideration.\nOn Sunday, the New York Times reported that Lutnick has \"gotten on Mr. Trump’s nerves lately.\" The president-elect is now expected to meet this week with former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh and Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan in a sign he is unsatisfied with his choices. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nWhile much of the jockeying appears to be about not spooking the stock market with a controversial pick, much of the debate playing out in public appears to be about finding a candidate who is credible to business leaders but also on board with Trump's economic ideas, specifically tariffs.\nTrump has long championed import duties as a potential \"ring around the country\" but the business community has often been much less sanguine about his ideas.\nRead more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them?\nThe attempt to bridge the divide has been on display for weeks.\n\"When was America great?\" Lutnick asked the crowd at Madison Square Garden before the election and before discussing the 1890s as an era where \"all we had was tariffs\" and the economy was \"rocking.\"\nIt got a cheer but was clearly designed to appeal mostly to Trump himself, who talked about the era of William McKinley pretty much nonstop on the campaign trail.\nBessent weighed in last week with a Fox News op-ed in which he argued that tariffs have a \"long and storied history as both a revenue-raising tool and a way of protecting strategically important industries.\"\nAs for Rowan, when he was asked about a possible trade war during an appearance at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference last week, he downplayed the chances, saying, \"Markets ... at the moment are not pricing in much for geopolitical risk.\"\nHe then quickly pivoted to arguing that Trump isn't a risk for global instability because of his strength.\nThe clear tension is that many of these candidates have often espoused more free trade efforts in the past and even, in the case of Warsh, have discussed \"the false promise of protectionism.\"\nHow that would work in a Trump administration that appears determined to go ahead with high duties remains to be seen, but the prospect of the tariffs has already led to considerable unease in the business community about their effect on everyday items and manufacturing inputs.\nPresident-elect Trump is expected to meet with his additional candidates this week, according to multiple reports, signaling a process that could continue in the days ahead.\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported that Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee could also be in the mix\nThe president-elect's quickly changing preferences have already hung over the entire transition process after other picks have surprised political observers multiple times with conventional choices for other posts being discarded in favor of nominees that few saw coming.\nOther candidates have publicly announced they aren't in the running for the job.\nLast Tuesday, billionaire investor John Paulson took his hat out of the ring for contention, saying \"complex financial obligations\" would keep him in the private sector. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon also made it clear Thursday that he won't be working for Trump in the coming years.\nFox Business host Larry Kudlow was also briefly mentioned as a candidate before representatives of the anchor told multiple reporters he is looking instead to stay with the network.\nThe Treasury secretary pick is also closely scrutinized, as it could be holding up other prominent economic choices, such as the next commerce secretary, National Economic Council director, and trade representative.\nTrump has nonetheless gone ahead with other economic-facing posts, announcing Brendan Carr as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and Chris Wright as secretary of energy.\n\"Trump, of course, likes to do things a bit differently, as we've noticed,\" noted Puck News founding partner William D. Cohan on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Capitol Gains podcast.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how U.S. policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "date": "2024-08-06T21:49:45.000Z",
        "article_content": "The whipsaw 2024 presidential election continues to surprise. It’s been less than a month since Vice President Kamala Harris jumped from the understudy of the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket to the starring role. Now, polls show her tied with Republican nominee Donald Trump, and in some cases ahead, marking a heady turnaround for once-demoralized Democrats who now sense a chance to banish Trump for good.\nAnd just like that, the “Trump trade” has lost all momentum. The Trump trade is a set of investment choices premised on Trump winning a second presidential term, and, just as important, his party capturing both houses of Congress for complete Republican control of government. That would allow Trump to enact his agenda with minimal opposition from Democrats.\nThe basic premises for the Trump trade are that Trump would slash regulation, raise tariffs on imports, keep taxes low or cut them further, and ignore the mushrooming national debt. Higher tariffs are inflationary and might force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher than they would be otherwise. So higher rates are core to the Trump trade. The economy might grow a bit faster once it mounts that inflationary hurdle. The national debt is a wild card because nobody’s sure when the market will start to balk at unprecedented amounts of federal debt. But whenever that happens, rates are likely to go higher still.\nIf there’s one single company that embodies the Trump trade, it’s Trump’s own — Trump Media & Technology Group, which goes by the ticker DJT. Trump Media, whose main product is the Truth Social network, is almost a pure-play bet on Trump’s election odds. If he wins, it could breathe life into a second-rate social network that has barely any revenue, since Trump will once again be the focus of world attention, routinely making news through his own posts on Truth Social. But if Trump loses, his political career will be mostly over, and Truth Social, puny compared with competitors such as Facebook and X, will have little reason to exist.\nSo how’s DJT doing? Not so great. After going public in March, the stock peaked at $66. Then it tanked in the midst of Trump’s New York business fraud trial, bottoming at $22 in mid-April. It yo-yoed after that, regaining ground as polls showed Trump widening his lead against Biden, even after Trump's convictions in New York. Since Biden withdrew on July 21 and Harris became the heir apparent, however, the stock has mostly fallen. It’s now at $27, down 59% from the March peak and just $5 above the April bottom.\nOther Trump trades are less direct but still in retreat. Market watchers began spotting signs of the Trump trade in mid-July, when Biden was at his nadir and Trump’s election odds in betting markets peaked at around 66%. Around that time, economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research wrote that “’Animal spirits’ have taken on a whole new head of steam because of this growing feeling that Donald Trump is going to emerge victorious.”\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nThe S&P 500 stock index hit its last record high on July 16, driven in part by the prospect of Trump winning the election with a Republican Congress that would keep all the Trump tax cuts from 2017 in place and maybe cut business taxes a bit more. Cryptocurrencies rallied, in part because Trump had turned from skeptic to believer, promising to treat crypto much more gently than Biden if elected. Some analysts also thought Trump 2.0 expectations were pushing rates higher than they would otherwise be, especially with the Fed poised to start cutting as early as September.\nThere were victims of the Trump trade too. In a July 16 interview, for instance, Trump suggested he might not intervene if China attacked Taiwan. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, Taiwan’s most important company, promptly fell 7%.\nNow, with Harris on a roll, Trump’s election odds have dropped from the peak of 66% in mid-July to around 52%. Harris’s election odds are 46%, with third-party candidates accounting for the rest. Harris’s rally seems likely to continue for a bit longer, given that she hasn’t yet enjoyed the “convention bump” that typically follows each party’s nominating convention. The Democratic confab begins Aug. 19 in Chicago.\nMarkets, meanwhile, suddenly have a lot to price in other than Trump. New signs of a slowing economy and out-of-sync central bank policies helped trigger a recent sell-off that trimmed the S&P 500 by 5% in one week. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have given back all their summer gains. Interest rates have dropped sharply during the last two weeks, as if everybody has forgotten about the risk of Trumpflation. Taiwan Semiconductor hasn’t fully recovered, but since Trump knocked down the stock in mid-July it has outperformed the broader tech sector, another sign of the Trump trade in reverse.\nIt's obviously an unpredictable election, so the Trump trade could return if Harris’s momentum stalls or something else gives Trump a fresh boost. It’s also possible a Harris trade could develop, based on the prospect of a Harris win with Democratic control of Congress. A month ago, a Democratic sweep looked like the least possible election outcome in 2024. Now, who knows?\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Donald Trump's election win shaped the stock market action early Wednesday, with a broad \"Trump trade\" pushing stocks, crypto, and other themes higher in a broad rally.\n\"The market initially is focused on all the potential positives of a Trump candidacy as far as lower regulations, lower taxes,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\nTrades that had frequently moved with Donald Trump's betting odds over the past month ripped higher as Trump clinched a victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election.\nTrump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) soared over 30% early Wednesday before paring those gains to close up about 6%. The stock, in which Trump owns several billion dollars worth of shares, had surged throughout Tuesday night as a Trump win looked increasingly likely.\nOther trades that had appeared to move in line with Trump's odds of winning also shot higher. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged to a fresh record high overnight as Trump emerged as the next president-elect. Investors had viewed Trump as the more pro-crypto candidate leading into the election.\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency surged above $76,000 per coin for the first time ever on Wednesday. Meltem Demirors, a general partner at Crucible Capital, told Yahoo Finance that the asset largely tracked Trump's betting odds 1-for-1 during the election cycle, a sign that investors had been dealing with a lot of \"indecision\" in the crypto market.\nIn July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters.\nHis promises to the industry included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a \"strategic national bitcoin stockpile.\"\nThe surge in prices for bitcoin and ethereum (ETH-USD), which was up more than 10% on Wednesday, came alongside a rise in crypto-related stocks.\nMicroStrategy (MSTR), which holds a significant amount of bitcoin on its balance sheet, rose more than 13%. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) also rose more than 31%, while Robinhood (HOOD), which offers cryptocurrency trading on its platform, popped almost 20%.\nInvestor support for the financial sector was also one of the standouts on Wednesday.\nThe SPDR Financials Sector ETF (XLF), which is comprised of some of the largest banks in the country, rose more than 6% for its best day in two years. Big banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), and Morgan Stanley (MS) were all up between 7% and 13%.\nMeanwhile, companies with pending acquisitions caught bids, as seen by the more than 20% rise in Discover Financials (DFS) stock, which is currently in agreement to be acquired by Capital One (COF).\nBroadly, New York Stock Exchange senior market strategist Michael Reinking told Yahoo Finance \"all of the macro moves that you would widely expect\" from a Trump win were at play.\nThe dollar (DX-Y.NYB) saw its biggest jump since 2016 as investors considered Trump's stance on higher tariffs. This coincided with a move higher in oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovering around $72 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $75 per barrel. Additionally, US-listed Chinese stocks dropped amid fears tariffs on goods from China could weigh on e-commerce giants like Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).\nTrump's policies are also viewed as inflationary, sparking a bond market sell-off. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose about 13 basis points to 4.42%. A sharp rise in yields can often become a headwind for stocks. \nBut that wasn't the case on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped more than 3.6%, or more than 1,500 points, to lead the gains. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 2.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 2.9%.\nIG North America CEO JJ Kinahan said that for now \"things appear to be strong\" but noted the rise in rates \"bears monitoring.\"\n\"Higher rates could disrupt the broader economy,\" Kinahan wrote in a note on Wednesday.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Since then, the benchmark index has risen less than 1%. At one point, the S&P 500 had given back all of its post-election bump before rallying higher once more.\nSmall caps, a popular Trump trade, surged after the election, with the Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) rising about 9% in the immediate aftermath. Then the trade reversed, with the index giving back over half its gains. Another swing saw the Russell 2000 hit a record intraday high on Monday.\nAs Calvasina wrote: \"Right now we simply don’t know what the new administration will do in regard to their campaign promises, or the extent to which they will do them, adding to the fog.\"\nAnother pillar of the Trump trade saw long-term Treasury yields rise, with investors fearing new tariffs would push inflation higher. News late Friday that the president-elect would nominate Scott Bessent to be the next Treasury secretary calmed some nerves, bringing the 10-year yield roughly back to where it stood on Election Day.\nIn a note to clients on Monday, Capital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth cautioned against reading too much into Trump's Cabinet picks given \"uncertainty surrounding what policies president-elect Donald Trump will enact during his second term.\"\nAshworth's comments get to the root of the market's issues right now: At the end of the day, campaign promises are just that, promises.\nDuring Trump's first term in office, nearly half of the 15 people he initially appointed to lead the executive departments were gone halfway through his presidency.\nIn a note Monday issuing his 2025 year-end S&P 500 forecast of 6,600, Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna opted not to include any impacts on how US policy shifts could impact earnings or valuations due to the \"fluidity of the Trump 2.0 policy outlook.\"\n\"[There] is a temptation to read a lot into [Trump's] Cabinet nominations, but we would caution against that,\" Capital Economics' Ashworth wrote.\n\"Following his comprehensive election victory this is Trump’s world, while the rest of us, including his cabinet, just live in it.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-11-06T23:52:21.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Lewis Krauskopf and Amanda Cooper\nNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election unleashed a massive rally in the dollar, drove stocks to record highs and punished bond prices as expectations of tax cuts and tariffs on imports drove optimism about economic growth while fueling worries about inflation.\nU.S. equity indexes soared, with the benchmark S&P 500 up 2.51% to a record high and huge gains in areas such as small-cap stocks and banks that are poised to benefit from Trump's expected lighter regulatory touch.\nThe dollar hit its highest level in over four months. Bitcoin hit record highs and Treasuries were battered.\n\"Everywhere you look, there's the thumbprints of these election results for markets,\" said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\nTrump's pledges to raise tariffs, cut taxes and slash regulations encouraged investors to dive into a range of assets that looked likely to benefit from such policies.\nMarkets that could suffer under tougher tariffs bore the brunt of the sell-off. The Mexican peso slumped to its lowest level in over two years while the euro was set for its largest daily drop since 2020.\nCurrency trading was intense. CME Group said by 10 a.m. CT, online trading of the Offshore Chinese Renminbi already had hit $33 billion in notional value, an all-time high. In the same time span, the traded notional value of futures contracts on the Mexican peso was 43% above the average daily volume.\nBolstering confidence in \"Trump trades,\" Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate. Investors were still awaiting results in the House of Representatives, and Republican control would clear the path for Trump's agenda.\nThe election could have far-reaching implications for tax and trade policy, as well as U.S. institutions, affecting assets globally.\nINTEREST RATES SEEN HIGHER\nInvestors sold U.S. Treasuries, partly on the expectation that higher tariffs would inevitably filter through to consumer prices, but also because Trump's promises on spending could boost government debt levels. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 4.48%, its highest level in over four months but retreated slightly.\n\"If he's able to fully implement his agenda, it means bigger deficits, bigger tax cuts, and also, because of tariffs, higher inflation,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"The higher inflation and the bigger deficits should push up long-term interest rates.\"\nIn stocks, shares of Tesla, headed by Trump supporter Elon Musk, jumped 14.75%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose nearly 6%, while the S&P 500 banks index jumped 10.68%.\nBitcoin surged to a record high, betting on a softer line on cryptocurrency regulation.\n\"Trump's win likely means some deregulation, including rolling back banking regulations,\" BlackRock Investment Institute said.\nInvestors started trading early. Retail trading platform Robinhood Markets had its largest-ever overnight trading session since it introduced that option in May 2023. The company said its total volume was 11 times a typical overnight trading session, with investors flocking to securities that pundits believe are likely to benefit from a second Trump presidency, ranging from Coinbase Global and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF to companies owned by Trump and his wealthiest fan, Elon Musk.\nThe results meant markets gained clarity about the presidency faster than in 2020, when Joe Biden was announced the victor some four days after election night.\n\"This is an economy that's in good shape as we go into the next Congress and the next administration, and the stock market is reflecting that with the removal of this uncertainty overhang,\" said Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas and lead of the ElectionWatch at UBS Wealth Management.\nMarket attention is turning to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision on Thursday, with Trump's victory set to potentially put the central bank on a slower and shallower path for interest-rate cuts, should the Republican's plans juice the economy.\n\"We now expect just one Fed cut in 2025, with policy on hold until the realized inflation shock from tariffs has passed,\" economists at Nomura said in a note.\n(Reporting by Amanda Cooper and Lewis Krauskopf; additional reporting by Suzanne McGee, Laura Matthews, Michelle Conlin, Nupur Anand, Chibuike Oguh, Noel Randewich, Saqib Ahmed, Saeed Azhar, Caroline Valetkevitch, Tom Westbrook, Kevin Buckland, Megan Davies, Douglas Gillison, Carolina Mandl, Lananh Nguyen, Danilo Masoni, Sinead Cruise and Alex Cornwell; Writing by Michelle Price and Amanda Cooper; Graphics by Pasit Kongkunakornkul, Vineet Sachdev and Sumanta Sen; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Sam Holmes, Peter Graff, Sharon Singleton, David Gregorio, Sandra Maler and Rod Nickel)"

        "article_content": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump and Elon Musk held a warm but glitch-delayed conversation on X that saw the tech mogul pitch a role for himself should the Republican nominee win a second White House term.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money\nBoston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery\nA Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival\nA Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk\nThe Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\nThe highly anticipated discussion started roughly 40 minutes late, stretched more than two hours and largely rehashed the notes that the former president routinely strikes at his campaign rallies.\nThe pushed-back start was an embarrassing blow to Musk’s social-media site and the latest hiccup for Trump, whose campaign has struggled to douse a burst of momentum from Vice President Kamala Harris in the weeks since she replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee.\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nThe billionaire entrepreneur blamed the delay on a cyberattack, without providing any evidence, and when the event started, Musk suggested Trump’s opponents were responsible.\nTrump sought to spin the delay as a sign of interest in the event. As many as 1.3 million listeners tuned in, according to X.\nMusk called for a government commission to ensure that taxpayer money is spent effectively and pitched himself for a role in that effort.\n“I’d be happy to help out on such a commission,” Musk said. “I’d love if it were formed.”\nTrump praised the idea, calling Musk “the greatest cutter.”\nBut otherwise, the event in some ways resembled an online Trump rally with Musk, the world’s richest man, playing the role of moderator.\nThe conversation came days after Trump held a more than one-hour press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort. One of his campaign strategies is to try and goad Harris into doing more unscripted media appearances.\nMusk endorsed Trump for president last month, part of a shift that has seen the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive officer publicly embrace right-leaning causes and candidates to make his mark on the political scene. He also created a super political action committee to support Trump’s reelection effort.\nAn already formidable Washington presence, with companies boasting sizable government contracts, Musk is poised to be an even bigger player if Trump returns to power. He’s grown closer to the GOP nominee, advising him on electric vehicles and cryptocurrency policy — a reversal from a once-rocky relationship that saw the two trade insults.\nHighlighting Musk’s growing sway with Trump, long a critic of electric vehicles, praised the EV maker, saying Tesla’s cars are “incredible.” He also hailed Musk’s intelligence, saying “You have definitely got a fertile mind. You and I can talk about rockets, tunnels and electric cars,” referencing the entrepreneur’s many business ventures.\nTrump taking a softer stance on EVs could have massive financial benefits for carmakers and Musk’s personal wealth, much of which is in Tesla stock. Trump has vowed to scrap some benefits intended to help grow the market if he returns to the White House. Those threats have intensified concerns over a slowdown in EV sales growth.\nTrump and Musk’s conversation comes at a critical point in the 2024 race — less than three months to Election Day. Harris’ ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket has shaken up the race with polls showing she has erased the lead Trump held for much of the summer and pulled ahead in fundraising.\nThe first 20 minutes of the event was spent on Trump recounting last month’s assassination attempt on his life at a Butler, Pennsylvania rally. He said that he would be returning to the town in October to resume the campaign event.\nBorder Crackdown\nMusk, like Trump, has criticized illegal immigration across the US-Mexico border and promoted conspiracy theories that Democrats are encouraging migration to bring in people to vote fraudulently in the 2024 election. Musk suggested the Republican candidate was “supportive” of legal migration but said the US needs “to shut down illegal immigration.”\n“I think most people who are illegal immigrants are actually good, but you can’t tell a difference unless there’s a solid vetting of who comes across the border,” said Musk, who was born in South Africa and described himself as a “legal immigrant.”\n“They have to come in legally. They have to be checked,” Trump said.\nRepublicans have seized on Harris having been given a portfolio that included addressing the root causes of migration earlier in the administration even though other officials such as Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas bore more direct responsibility for the situation at the border.\n“Trump’s entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself — self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024,” Harris campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement after the event concluded.\nMusk, who tops the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $227.3 billion, aims to use his vast fortune to swing the race for Trump.\nMusk served on White House advisory councils when Trump was president, but left after the Republican decided to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate accord. Musk’s stint on the councils was mired in controversy as supporters urged him to step down.\nTech Glitch\nThe technical mishap on X, which delayed the start of the event, drew comparisons to the glitches that foiled the launch of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s ill-fated presidential campaign last year, as servers struggled to handle surging demand.\nX has faced technical problems and scrutiny since Musk purchased the platform in 2022.\n“This massive attack illustrates there’s a lot of opposition to people just hearing what President Trump has to say,” Musk said when the event finally began. “This is really aimed at kind of open-minded, independent voters who are trying to make up their mind.”\nTrump was banned from X, then known as Twitter, after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, but had his account restored after Musk bought the company.\nTrump returned to X in August 2023, posting his mug shot after being indicted in Fulton County, Georgia on charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election result, but has preferred to use his own social-media site, Truth Social. On Monday, however, Trump posted several times to X, including a campaign video.\n(Recasts first two paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nSurgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "article_content": "View this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nDonald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, has become America’s 47th president after crossing the 270 electoral college-vote threshold necessary to clinch the presidential election and defeat Kamala Harris.\nWhile a handful of states have yet to declare official winners, Trump locked down all of the states he was expected to, as well as several pivotal battleground states including North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. He also was on track to win the popular vote for the first time in his three campaigns for America's highest political office. At 11 a.m. the day after the election, the vote totals were:\nTrump: 71,571,051 votes (51%).\nHarris: 66,712,662 votes (47.5%).\nTrump’s victory follows a bitter, hard-fought campaign in which American voters were asked to choose between sitting Vice President Kamala Harris, who focused on the dangers a Trump presidency posed to democracy and women’s reproductive rights, and former President Trump, who asked them a classic challenger’s question: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?”\nAfter four years of a COVID epidemic, inflation spike, and an affordability crisis, America’s voters—like voters the world over—answered “no” and chose to punish the incumbent administration. A majority (52%) of respondents in an October Gallup poll said they and their family were worse off than four years before, a percentage only approached in 1992, when Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush after one term.\n“Almost every major election in the world this year was a change election. Incumbents lost because voters believed their country was heading in the wrong direction,” Eurasia group founder and president Ian Bremmer posted on X. “The United States is no exception.”\nAmericans' desire for change was intense enough that about 3 in 10 voters told AP VoteCast, a massive nationwide survey of over 120,000 voters, that they wanted a total upheaval in how the U.S. is run—and more than half said they wanted substantial change.\nThe economy and immigration—Trump’s two top issues—far overshadowed Harris’s priorities of democracy and abortion in the same survey, with some 9 in 10 voters saying they were very or somewhat concerned about the cost of groceries.\nBefore receiving the official electoral votes required to win, Trump addressed a lively crowd at his Florida campaign headquarters, using his “Make America Great Again” slogan.\nTrump called the election result a “magnificent victory for the American people” and declared it the beginning of a “golden age” for the country.\nHe told supporters, “I hope one day you’ll look back and consider this one of the most important days of your life.” Trump also noted his party’s recapture of the Senate, saying, “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.”\nTrump's election reverberated across world markets, as investors anticipated more market-friendly policies and economic growth.\nThe three main U.S: exchanges rose in premarket trading, with the Dow adding over 3%, while Trump Media—often viewed as a tracking stock for Trump’s election chances—spiked some 36% in early trading. Shares in Trump ally and funder Elon Musk’s Tesla also jumped more than 12%, while Bitcoin shot past $75,000 to a new all-time high, on Trump’s pledges of support for crypto.\nEven stocks in Europe, which could be a casualty of a new “America First” Trump administration, managed to squeeze out 1% gains in early trading.\nShares in China, a likely target for massive tariffs under Trump, were the exception, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng falling over 2% and Shanghai’s index slipping a marginal 0.1%. The currency in regular Trump target Iran also took a massive hit, falling to a all-time low on his election.\nFortune will have plenty of reactions, insight, analysis, and reporting in the coming hours, days, and weeks. But first, let’s take a look at how the 2024 election went down.\nOur official tally:\nKamala Harris has been declared victor in 17 states—Vermont, Maryland, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, New York, Colorado, California, Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Virginia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Minnesota, plus the District of Columbia, Maine's 1st congressional district, and Nebraska's 2nd congressional district—capturing 223 electoral votes.\nDonald Trump has been declared victor in 27 states—Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Arkansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Louisiana, Wyoming, Ohio, Texas, Missouri, Utah, Montana, Iowa, Kansas, Idaho, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Maine's 2nd congressional district and Nebraska's 1st and 3rd congressional districts—capturing 279 electoral votes.\nRemember, you need 270 electoral votes to win the U.S. presidential election.\nBitcoin smashes its all-time high as Trump clinches victory.\nThe Trump trade rebounded as Election Day leaned Republican.\nPrediction markets surged towards Trump after results started rolling in.\nElon Musk says he wants to be a political player even after the election is over.\nRussian meddlers targeted polling places with bomb threats in critical swing states.\nTrump Media stock was halted three times on Election Day after its price dropped 15% in 15 minutes.\nBelow is a complete rundown of when polls closed for every U.S. state. Worth noting: Parts of some states close earlier than others, which we flagged.\n6:00 p.m. ET: Kentucky (some polls close), Indiana (some polls close)\n7:00 p.m. ET: Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, Florida (some polls close), New Hampshire (some polls close)\n7:30 p.m. ET: North Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia, Florida (some polls close), New Hampshire (some polls close)\n8:00 p.m. ET: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Kansas (some polls close), Michigan (some polls close), North Dakota (some polls close), South Dakota (some polls close), Texas (some polls close)\n8:30 p.m. ET: Arkansas, Kansas (some polls close), Michigan (some polls close), North Dakota (some polls close), South Dakota (some polls close), Texas (some polls close)\n9:00 p.m. ET: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, Wyoming\n10:00 p.m. ET: Montana, Nevada, Utah, Idaho (some polls close), Oregon (some polls close)\n11:00 p.m. ET: California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington\nMidnight ET: Hawaii, Alaska (some polls close)\n1:00 a.m. ET: Alaska\nHere's a rundown of the notable final polls in the lead-up to Election Day:\nNPR/PBS News/Marist: 51% Harris, 47% Trump\nReuters/Ipsos: 51% Harris, 47% Trump\nABC News/Ipsos: 49% Harris, 46% Trump\nNew York Times/Siena College: Harris leads in all but one swing state (Michigan)\nOf course, Trump ended up winning the election—through the popular and electoral vote—by a considerable margin.

        "article_content": "Companies are in the dark about how exactly antitrust enforcement would shift under a new administration, upending merger plans until a 2024 outcome is certain.\nChipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has paused considerations to acquire struggling chip maker Intel (INTC), according to a report by Bloomberg, a delay intended to help the company evaluate the new administration’s approach to antitrust enforcement and US-China relations.\nOil giant ConocoPhillips (COP) is also hoping to push the closing of its Marathon Oil (MRO) acquisition to after the inauguration of a new president, according to a report by The New York Times.\nAnother big deal that hangs in the balance during this red-hot political season is the union of credit card lenders Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).\nCapital One CEO Richard Fairbank told analysts Thursday that he expects to complete the tie-up \"early in 2025 subject to regulatory and shareholder\" approvals.\nThe New York Times earlier reported that the companies hoped for a close by Dec. 31 because of concerns that Donald Trump might look unfavorably upon their deal if he were to win.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James may have scuttled chances for an earlier close. On Wednesday, James announced a probe into whether the Capital One-Discover tie-up would harm New Yorkers.\n\"We continue to work through the regulatory approval process, and we’re fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration,\" Fairbank added Thursday in an earnings release.\nThe problem for any business considering M&A activity at the moment is that little has been said on the campaign trail by either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Trump about how they would mold the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, the agencies that police US competition laws.\nWhat’s more, changes to the agencies’ antitrust guidelines and public sentiment could mean the tea leaves won’t be easy to read no matter who wins the White House.\n“The problem for the businesses is what kind of person will have these jobs at both the DOJ and FTC,” said Yale economics professor Fiona Scott Morton.\nRead more: What the 2024 campaign means for your wallet: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election\nGreg Bader, an antitrust lawyer and shareholder with Gunster, said his firm has continued to see potentially reportable M&A transactions, but with the pending election, “you really don't want to start a merger now … when it's so murky.”\nBarclays analyst Jason Goldberg said he thinks getting through the US election \"irrespective of who wins\" could be positive for overall corporate investment banking activity.\n\"Corporates will just have a better sense of which policies they're going to be confronting over the next four years,\" he added.\nThere are some reasons to believe that both candidates could take a tough stance on corporate mergers.\nWhile Harris has not publicly revealed her antitrust posture, Bader and Scott Morton said they expect the vice president would continue President Joe Biden’s wide-ranging effort to rein in what his administration views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.\nOn Thursday, the White House announced a new investigation into competition in air travel after successfully blocking three airline mergers in four years.\nThe administration has also alleged anticompetitive conduct by tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's (MSFT) acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly (a tie-up that a district court declined to put on hold at the FTC's request).\nThe FTC, led by Chair Lina Khan, has won some victories too, including a decision Thursday by a US judge to block the pending $8.5 billion acquisition of Capri by handbag and accessories maker Tapestry.\nThe agency also challenged the tie-up between grocery chains Kroger (KR) and Albertsons (ACI), which is now pending. On the campaign trail, Harris has specifically named food and beverage company consolidations when discussing how she would increase regulatory scrutiny as president.\nBut Trump could support some of these cases, based on his past actions. One of the Biden administration’s key antitrust victories — over search giant Google (GOOG, GOOGL) — was a case initially filed by Trump’s Justice Department, alleging the tech giant illegally monopolized the search engine market.\nLaw firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom noted that Trump’s administration took several actions to bolster antitrust enforcement, raising novel theories to challenge vertical mergers, creating the FTC’s Technology Task Force, and opening investigations into Google, Amazon, Meta (META), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft.\nYale's Scott Morton, on the other hand, said she would expect Trump to lean into a Republican preference for corporate profits by “allowing anybody to merge who wants to.”\nOtherwise, she expects the former president to make exceptions to exact retribution against those he perceives as rivals, citing the DOJ’s challenge to AT&T’s acquisition of CNN and alleged crackdown on marijuana company mergers.\nThe Justice Department has said it may recommend to a federal judge a breakup of Google as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market.\nIn a recent interview conducted by Bloomberg's editor in chief before the Economic Club of Chicago, Trump suggested that Google’s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire.\n“What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it’s more fair,” Trump said in that Oct. 15 interview. The former president described Google’s search engine as “rigged” and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China.\nOther antitrust lawyers predict that Trump may take a lighter approach to M&A and monopoly conduct challenges.\nMatt Bisturis, a business attorney at Schwabe, predicted that a new Trump administration would likely “de-emphasize regulatory scrutiny, and go easier on private equity roll-ups.”\nBarry Barnett, an antitrust litigation attorney with Susman Godfrey, pointed out that although people at the top of the Trump administration may be less aggressive in the kinds of cases they bring and may be willing to resolve them without seeking breakups, enforcement will be impacted by other influences.\nEven a second Trump administration could look different, Barnett said, because the DOJ and FTC repealed vertical merger guidelines drafted under the Trump administration and replaced them with a more lenient standard to presume mergers are illegal.\nAnd Barnett and Scott Morton agreed that judges are changing the way that they evaluate antitrust cases by shifting away from defendant-friendly interpretations of the consumer welfare standard.\n\"That general social understanding that we have a problem and we need to move our policy levers to fix that problem undoubtedly affects judges as well,\" Scott Morton said, \"because they're in charge of looking at evidence, and the evidence is really, really strong.\"\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "By Arasu Kannagi Basil, Pete Schroeder and Lananh Nguyen\n(Reuters) -U.S. bank stocks were unfazed on Friday after a report that President-elect Donald Trump's team had floated the idea of shrinking or eliminating a top banking regulator, with analysts saying such a plan would not win the necessary political backing.\nIn recent interviews with bank regulator candidates, Trump advisers have asked whether the incoming president could abolish the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) and move its deposit insurance function into the Treasury Department, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nOfficials from the newly founded Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tasked with finding major government savings, participated in the interviews, the WSJ said.\nHowever, while the current system comprising three federal and multiple state bank regulators is complex, a major restructure would struggle to garner the political support needed to get through Congress, which is also expected to be tied up on tax reform and crypto legislation next year, analysts and academics said.\n\"It would require congressional action and despite the Republican party majority in both the Senate and the House, it would require support from the Democrats which remains very unlikely,\" ING sector strategist Marine Leleux wrote in a note.\nBank stocks were little changed on Friday.\nThe Trump transition team has been interviewing candidates for financial agency roles, including the bank regulators, in recent days, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. DOGE officials have been involved in some of those interviews, one said.\nBut at least one candidate for a top regulatory post was not asked about overhauling or streamlining the agencies, suggesting the idea is still in its early stages, said the second source.\nSpokespeople for the transition team did not immediately provide comment, while an FDIC spokesperson declined to comment.\nTrump has pledged to slash burdensome rules but has said little about bank regulation. Last year, the pro-Trump Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 manifesto called for \"more streamlined\" bank supervision through the merger of the FDIC with other bank regulators. During his campaign, Trump disavowed the project but has since announced plans to appoint key contributors to prominent roles in government.\n\"Even if you could get it through Congress...it would be an exceedingly heavy lift and have lots of unintended consequences,\" said Julie Hill, dean of the University of Wyoming College of Law, noting the FDIC had the experience and expertise necessary to oversee banks and safeguard the deposit insurance fund.\nThe FDIC plays a key role in the financial stability of the world's largest economy with its deposit insurance fund backstopping trillions in insured bank deposits. The importance of the FDIC in shoring up financial stability was once again highlighted last year when three regional banks failed.\n\"It is the only regulatory entity whose professionals have the expertise and ability to do bank resolutions,\" said Mayra Rodriguez Valladares, bank and capital markets risk consultant at MRV Associates.\nStill, top U.S. banking executives expect Trump's incoming administration will overhaul bank regulatory policy, including by easing up on mergers, and shelving onerous bank capital rules, while some academics said streamlining the system was long overdue.\n\"There has been a massive duplication of function and massive waste, and this is an incredible opportunity to consolidate,\" said Rebel Cole, professor of finance, Florida Atlantic University.\n(Reporting by Arasu Kannagi Basil and Jaiveer Shekhawat in Bengaluru, Lananh Nguyen in New York, and Matt Tracy, Pete Schroeder and Douglas Gillison in Washington; Writing by Michelle Price; Editing by Noor Zainab Hussain, Anil D'Silva and Rosalba O'Brien)"

        "article_content": "Democrats are deservedly disheartened at the drubbing voters administered in the 2024 elections. Americans didn’t just restore Donald Trump to the White House, they also gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress and exiled the Democratic Party to the political wilderness.\nTrumpism rules, it seems. But there could be another trend at work that will boomerang back on to Trump, eventually: Americans may be chronically gloomy about stagnating living standards and bound to take it out on whoever is in charge.\nFor three elections in a row, voters have bounced the incumbent party from the White House. Trump upset Hillary Clinton in 2016 in what was partly a vote against the slow-growing Barack Obama economy. Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020 amid widespread dissatisfaction with Trump’s handling of the COVID pandemic.\nThe 2024 election was a referendum on the policies of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket in August. The outcome: thumbs down, especially on economic issues.\nThe incumbent party normally has a decisive advantage in presidential elections, whether the president is running for another term or passing the torch to a successor. Unless there's a recession, the incumbent party typically wins. Yet there was no recession in 2016, when voters replaced the incumbent Democrat with a Republican. There was a short recession in 2020, but it ended seven months before Election Day, when voters ejected Trump. And despite high inflation, there’s been no recession under Biden. The power of incumbency simply isn’t what it used to be.\nInflation was clearly ruinous for Biden and Harris, but so was their inability to fix intractable problems that go back decades. In a recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, the economy ranked as the top issue for 2024 voters and 58% rated the economy as “weak.” Of people who cast a ballot, 76% said they voted for change.\nTrump was the change candidate because he’s been on the sidelines for the past four years — and there were no other choices. So will Trump bring the change Americans want? On some issues — notably immigration — he could, because the president has the authority to set policy in a way that will make a difference. But there’s a good chance many of the problems vexing voters in 2024 will be just as nettlesome in 2028, when Trump will be the incumbent promoting his own vice president, JD Vance, as the future of Trumpism.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nAmerica has become a wrong-track country. For the last 20 years, more than half of all Americans have been unhappy with the direction of the country, according to Gallup. There was an uptick in satisfaction under Trump, but that crashed amid COVID. The broader trend is stark: Not once during the last 20 years has satisfaction approached the peaks of the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president, or the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan served two terms.\nThe most likely explanation for this national gloom is worsening wealth and income inequality, with well-educated workers in dynamic areas getting ahead and undereducated workers in stagnant parts of the country falling behind. Wealth for college graduates has grown by 356% since 2000, according to Federal Reserve data. Wealth for Americans with just a high school degree has grown by just 100% during the same time frame. The portion of wealth held by college grads has grown from 60% to 74% since 2000. For high-school grads, it has dropped from 17% to 9%.\nThere’s nothing wrong with well-educated people in the right places getting wealthier. But there’s a lot wrong with lesser-educated people who make up the majority of the US population getting poorer. Trump appeals to that demographic when he rails against companies shipping jobs overseas and migrants working for less pay than Americans might.\nIn the 2024 election, 43% of voters had a college degree, while 57% did not. Less-educated Americans are decisive in national elections. They’re the ones demanding change, in the form of paychecks that stretch further and improving living standards. But there’s no simple cure for a tech-based service economy that has left millions of workers behind.\nTrump’s plan to slap new tariffs on imports and deport millions of undocumented migrants won’t do anything to restore the sort of high-paying manufacturing jobs millions of Americans relied on 50 years ago. Automation, artificial intelligence, and agile supply chains provide the efficiency big companies crave. They don’t want to hire more Americans to do manual labor for higher pay, and Trump can’t browbeat them into doing so.\nSome cities and states have programs to match employers with local schools that train the types of workers they need, which helps young people develop the skills that will help them get ahead. Trump hasn’t proposed anything like that. Instead, he falls back on lazy, supply-side orthodoxy: Cut taxes and regulations and turn businesses loose to grow and prosper. Developments of the last 40 years show that this enriches the shareholder class, with little trickling down to workers.\nIf anything, Trump could put upward pressure on prices, just as inflation seems to be abating, by deporting migrants who work on farms and at processing plants and making imported products more expensive through higher tariffs. Trump hasn’t proposed anything to lower housing costs, and interest rates are already drifting upward in anticipation of slightly higher inflation and a lot more deficit spending under Trump. If that happens, rent and groceries could take a bigger bite out of the typical paycheck four years from now.\nBiden’s record as president holds cautionary notes for Trump and other future presidents. Biden actually got measurable results that ought to boost blue-collar fortunes. He signed laws funding infrastructure buildout, semiconductor manufacturing, and green energy investment, which will subsidize employment in those fields years into the future. Some provisions of those laws require employers getting subsidies to hire unionized workers. The economy, meanwhile, has added 685,000 manufacturing jobs since Biden took office, twice the number under Trump before COVID hit and unemployment soared.\nNone of that impressed voters in 2024, and Trump could have just as much difficulty moving the needle during the next four years. And in 2028, the Trumpist candidate will be the incumbent trying to sell voters on more of the same.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Stricter return-to-office policies that could prompt workers to leave are also being discussed.\n(Reporting by Rajveer Singh Pardesi, Mrinmay Dey and Angela Christy M in Bengaluru; Editing by Sandra Maler)"

        "article_content": "Donald Trump’s election provides a useful occasion to examine the difference between what rich people want and what constitutes a thriving economy.\nThe stock market, which is where rich people live, has been climbing since Election Day. On November 6, the day Trump was declared the winner, the Dow rose 3.6 percent; the S&P 500 scored its biggest gain in two years; and the world’s 10 richest people, nine of whom live in the United States, saw their wealth increase by a combined $63.5 billion. Over the month of November, the S&P 500 rose 5.7 percent. Stocks fell in December after the Fed signaled it would ratchet back rate cuts, but as of December 18, U.S. equities were still up 29 percent for the year.\nThe economy, on the other hand, is starting to falter. The Fed ratcheted back future rate cuts because Trump keeps threatening to slap tariffs on every conceivable import. On Friday, Trump boasted on Truth Social: “I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas. Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!” The United States is the largest exporter of oil to the EU already, and the European Commission previously floated the idea of buying more liquefied natural gas from the United States (because it’s cheaper than Russian LNG). So it’s quite possible Trump is merely trying to take credit for something that’s happening anyway. But if Trump aims to push the EU further, he could start a trade war.\nEverybody knows that Trump is all about reviving American manufacturing. But the National Association of Manufacturers, whose president, Jay Timmons, praised Trump in 2017 as “a true champion for our industry,” forecast in a postelection survey that in 2025 capital investment would grow only 1.6 percent. “That’s not particularly robust,” Timmons told Bloomberg’s Mark Niquette. In a December forecast, another manufacturing trade group, the Institute for Supply Management, predicted a more robust increase of 5.2 percent. But that’s compared to an increase of 5.6 percent this calendar year—when, Niquette pointed out, high interest rates inhibited investment.\nVanguard is an investment management firm and therefore part of the rich-people ecosystem, not the economy. But in addition to forecasting market trends it forecasts bona fide economic trends, and late last month it said gross domestic product growth, which has been 3 percent or higher under the supposedly ruinous economic policies of President Joe Biden, will fall to 2.7 percent next year under Trump. And that’s assuming Trump is mostly blowing smoke about tariffs and a mass roundup of immigrants. If he isn’t blowing smoke, says Vanguard, then GDP growth will be more like 2 percent.\nLike the Fed, Vanguard is worried that Trump’s trade policies will increase so-called “core” inflation, or inflation minus volatile food and energy costs. On Friday the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures index, which the Fed and Vanguard both prefer to the Labor Department’s consumer price index, showed core inflation to be 2.8 percent in November, same as it was in October. Trump promised in July that if voters elected him “inflation will vanish completely.” But Vanguard says that “inflation will remain above 2.5 percent for most of 2025.” Even Trump has stopped pretending he’ll conquer inflation, telling Eric Cortellessa in his Time “Person of the Year” interview, “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up.” \nIn that same July speech, Trump said, “Incomes will skyrocket.” But according to the website Trading Economics, which compiles statistics from official sources, nominal wage growth will fall from its October level of 5.6 percent (and a projected 5.4 percent for the final quarter of 2024) to 4.7 percent, 3.5 percent, and 2.5 percent during the respective first, second, and third quarters of 2025. If Vanguard is right that inflation won’t fall below 2.5 percent next year, then real wages will either stop growing next year or start falling. Under Biden, real median and real average wages have been rising for two and a half years. \nOf course, these are all predictions; we can’t know precisely what’s coming in 2025. But my own view is that these respectable calculations err on the side of optimism. The pros predict that the economy will fare somewhat worse. Freed of their imperative to give every benefit of the doubt, I believe the economy will tank. Your investments may appreciate in value, which is all the oligarchs really care about. But this time next year, I doubt your boss will promise you a raise for 2026. Instead, he may tell you to clean out your desk."

        "article_content": "Relief swept Washington, D.C., after Congress ended a budget standoff and passed a short-term spending bill on Dec. 21, averting a government shutdown. But that year-end legislative battle may foretell further fiscal chaos in 2025, including the risk of another downgrade of US debt.\nDonald Trump will take office on Jan. 20 with his fellow Republicans running both houses of Congress. That Republican “trifecta”— full control of the legislative and executive branches — has boosted hopes that Trump will be able to extend a huge set of tax cuts due to expire at the end of 2025 and perhaps rein in government spending.\nThe Trump agenda, however, now looks a lot shakier, and the recent funding battle demonstrates why.\nThough Republicans control the House, the party is split into factions, including a group of budget hawks that numbers more than 30. Those Republicans are dead set against tax cuts or spending hikes that add substantially to the national debt, now more than $36 trillion.\nThe Dec. 21 spending bill passed the House by a comfortable 366-34 margin, but that’s because every Democrat voted for it. Democrats were willing to join most Republicans in voting for the bill so President Biden doesn’t have to manage an unpopular shutdown during his final days in office. Once the House voted, the Senate passed the funding bill without any problem.\nBut minority Democrats aren’t likely to vote for Republican priorities once Trump takes office. And once the next Congress convenes on Jan. 3, Republicans will have just a five-seat majority, which is even thinner than the current GOP breakdown. That means partisan legislation will require virtually every Republican vote, a feat that has become notoriously difficult in the fractious GOP during the last several years.\nRepublican lawmakers are already working on a huge set of tax cuts meant to be the capstone for the first year of Trump’s second term. That includes an extension of all the individual tax cuts enacted in 2017, which expire at the end of 2025. Republicans also hope to include new measures Trump has proposed, such as eliminating the income tax on tips.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter.\nBut the latest revenue fight raises fresh doubts about whether Republicans can get it done.\n“Our discussions with Republican staff on Capitol Hill have increasingly suggested that a partisan bill that addresses the expiring [tax cuts] will be inordinately difficult, if not impossible, to pass next year,” Henrietta Treyz, co-founder of Veda Partners, wrote in a recent analysis. “The government funding debate neatly illustrates why Republican staff is feeling anxious about their prospects next year.”\nThe basic problem is that extending the 2017 tax cuts would add about $4 trillion to the national debt, with the bill even higher if Congress lards in additional tax breaks. Republicans will try to cut spending to offset some of that, but most spending goes toward defense, which most Republicans support, plus politically popular programs such as Medicare and Social Security. Major spending cuts would outrage voters, including many Republicans, which means there’s no real way to prevent tax cuts from ballooning the debt even more.\nWhen Congress first passed the Trump tax cuts in 2017, 12 House Republicans voted against the bill. But Republicans had a far larger majority then and could afford to lose some internal support. In 2025, just two or three defections will be enough to sink GOP legislation. And there seem to be more than two renegade Republicans.\nThe most telling moment in the recent funding dispute wasn’t the vote tally on the final bill but the vote on an earlier bill Trump urged all Republicans to vote for. Thirty-eight Republicans bucked Trump, dooming that bill. Their main objection was that the bill would have suspended the debt limit, the law that limits the total amount of money the US government can borrow.\nThe bill Congress finally passed on Dec. 21 did not address the debt limit, which means Trump is going to have to tangle with that, which he was hoping to avoid. During the last big spending fight in 2023, Congress suspended the debt limit, but only until Jan. 1, 2025. That means it will have to raise the debt limit again next year, saddling Trump with what has routinely become an ugly political fight.\nThe next 12 months, in fact, are going to be filled with fiscal fireworks. There will be another funding fight in March, which is when the current temporary spending expires. Around that time, the deadline may be drawing near for when Congress has to raise the borrowing limit. Then there will be another spending battle in September, which is when the government’s fiscal year ends and Congress needs to approve the next year’s funding.\nMarkets usually survive government shutdowns without much bruising. But debt ceiling fights can get harrowing because there’s an implicit threat that the US will default on some payments if Congress doesn’t raise the limit.\nS&P downgraded the US debt rating for the first time ever in 2011 following a congressional standoff that left the Treasury days away from a default. Fitch cut the US debt rating after the 2023 showdown, while Moody’s changed its US outlook from stable to negative. All three agencies cite political dysfunction as their main concern.\nSince the US fiscal situation gets progressively worse, those concerns are likely intensifying. In 2023, when Fitch cut the US rating, the national debt was $32 trillion. Eighteen months later, it’s $4 trillion higher. Plus, there have been some signs that endless US borrowing is beginning to rattle bond markets, which is how a US debt crisis would likely begin.\nTrump may still get his tax cuts. But the political brawls it will take to get there will leave the United States in even shakier fiscal shape than it's in now.\nSomebody, at some point, is going to have to say no more.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "5 Decades of Trump's Acts of Kindness\nPalm Beach, Florida, Oct. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nEMBARGOED FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nPress Release\nArticle: https://thinkcarebelieve.blog/2024/10/22/how-president-trump-really-helped-real-people/\n\nPalm Beach, Florida-  The media has not shown us all of the good that President Trump has done throughout his life. In order to make informed decisions about this important election, we need to make ourselves aware of who President Trump really is. It gives us a more complete picture of whom we are choosing to lead this country, at this critical time. He has done good for people quietly, in big and small ways, for decades without wanting press for it.\nThinkCareBelieve's Article\nThinkCareBelieve's article gives links to dozens of examples where Donald Trump has extended kindness to someone in need for over 50 years.  These aren't campaign publicity stunts.  These are things that Donald Trump has done without publicity.  The only way this information is known is because people came forward in numerous ways to tell their stories of how Donald Trump has helped their family, or repaid them in a big way for their kindness.  He reportedly scoured newspapers looking for people in need and extended a kindness to them.  He helped famous people like Nelson Mandela, Jennifer Hudson and Ed McMahon, but more often than not, it was someone on the verge of being forgotten, about to give up, and really needed it.\nSome Examples\nTrump pays off the mortgage of someone for fixing the engine on his stranded limo: https://x.com/BoLoudon/status/1821269478413647903\nSaving Ed McMahon's home: https://x.com/BoLoudon/status/1820594536902779363\nPays for breast cancer treatment: https://x.com/mollie_don/status/1807993310566383871\nSaving children and combatting child sex trafficking:  https://x.com/TheThe1776/status/1601979649533382658\nHelping a family struck by tragedy:  https://twitter.com/ReedMCooper/status/1657822616755884033\nTrump gives people chances when nobody would bother:  https://x.com/DixiDarlen/status/1845672217276727485\nYoung Trump helps a young man who was bullied: https://x.com/BoLoudon/status/1820179018819473785\nThere are dozens more stories like this in ThinkCareBelieve's article.\nSome Examples\nAll of this says something about the man.  Donald Trump wasn't just paying it back, or paying it forward, he was making an investment in the triumph of the human spirit.  He let people know that the world has not forgotten them, and helped them decide not to give up.  Trump's actions prove his faith in humanity and the strength of human endurance.  Personally, watching a man who has been shot and slandered, threatened and legally attacked, the fact that Donald Trump has not stopped doing acts of kindness for people in trouble shows the make of the man.  It shows real character, and that is nothing that a PR campaign can create out of thin air.\nThese acts speak for themselves.  When someone does something consistently over such a long period of time, and hasn't asked for anything in return, you can feel pretty confident that you are seeing the truth.\nThinkCareBelieve  is an outlook. ThinkCareBelieve will do its best to accentuate the possibilities for positive outcomes. To find the commonalities between diverse groups and bring the focus on common needs to work together toward shared goals. Activism is an important aspect of ThinkCareBelieve, because public participation and awareness to issues needing exposure to light leads to justice. Improved transparency in government can lead to changes in policy and procedure resulting in more fluid communication between the public and the government that serves them. America needs hope right now, and Americans need to be more involved in their government.\n###\nCONTACT: CONTACT: Joanne COMPANY: ThinkCareBelieve EMAIL: joanne@thinkcarebelieve.blog WEB: thinkcarebelieve.blog\n"

        "title": "Trump’s media stock was halted for extremely volatile trading as America went to the polls",
        "date": "2024-11-06T05:38:18.000Z",
        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump’s social media company was temporarily halted – twice – after a sudden and precipitous plunge on Election Day following a massive surge.\nShares of Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group, which trades under the symbol “DJT,” briefly turned negative after spiking as much as 17% earlier Tuesday morning. After the stock was halted for volatility, shares began to recover but ended the day down more than 1%.\nHowever, the stock jumped more than 10% in after-hours trading on Tuesday night as election results began to trickle in.\nIt wasn’t clear what caused the massive sell-off – or the earlier spike. Prediction markets have barely budged Tuesday, and other so-called Trump trades that are betting on a Trump victory remained strong.\n“Markets are very thin and skittish, DJT exceptionally so,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.\nThe company faces a potential make-or-break moment that will be decided by voters Tuesday. The stock gained 12% Monday, rebounding from three days of steep losses last week.\nTraders have been betting for months that a Trump victory could enhance the value of Truth Social — though justifying its current price tag would be very difficult even if Trump is back in the White House. Third-quarter results, posted by Trump Media after the closing bell on Election Day, paint the picture of a company still struggling to build a business.\nTrump Media is losing money and generates very little revenue. Its main product, conservative social network Truth Social, remains tiny. Yet Trump Media has morphed into a multi-billion-dollar meme stock and a favorite way for traders to bet on how this election cliffhanger will end, inflating the net worth of its biggest shareholder along the way.\nSome other elements of the so-called Trump Trade increased on Tuesday. Big bank stocks and bitcoin rallied. So did private prison companies Geo Group and CoreCivic. Prediction markets have shifted in Trump’s direction in recent days, too.\nStill, the final polls and prominent election models suggest the race for the White House is a true coin flip that could go either way.\n“I don’t know where the market gets its confidence from,” said Sosnick. “I think that those who have been favoring the former president all along are a confident bunch, and this is their last opportunity to express that confidence before we learn whether it is justified.”\nMatthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, told CNN on Tuesday that it’s far too early to draw any conclusions from the Trump Media volatility and other market moves.\n“It’s extremely early. I don’t think we’re seeing smart money here. We’re seeing people throwing darts at a board,” Tuttle said.\nTrump Media announced Tuesday that its dipped 6% year-over-year to just $1 million. It lost another $19.3 million, although that was an improvement from $26 million the year-ago quarter.\nEven as losses pile up, Trump Media ended the third quarter with no debt and $673 million in cash and short-term investments.\nDevin Nunes, the former Republican Congressman who is now Trump Media’s CEO, said the company “continues to explore additional possibilities for growth,” including potential mergers and acquisitions with fintech or other firms. Nunes highlighted recent efforts to launch a digital TV service, Truth+, and introduce live TV streaming on Truth Social.\nTrump Media has plenty at stake this election.\nEven though Trump Media generated just $1.6 million in revenue through the first half of this year, it’s valued at nearly $8 billion based on Tuesday’s gains. That means Trump Media’s market value is about equal to Paramount Global, a media conglomerate that owns CBS and has brought in more than $14 billion this year.\nIf Trump loses the election, Trump Media has little to fall back on. Venture capitalist Gene Munster recently told CNN that a Trump loss could cause Trump Media’s value to crash to just $1 billion. Others think it could be worth even less.\n“I wouldn’t touch DJT because I think the downside is zero, and I’m not sure how much upside there is,” Tuttle said.\nTrump owns 114.75 million shares in the company, making him the dominant shareholder. At current prices, those shares are worth about $3.9 billion. That’s up sharply from $1.4 billion on Sept. 23 when Trump Media closed at a record low.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

        "date": "2024-12-06T20:00:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Markets rode a wave of euphoria following Donald Trump’s Nov. 5 victory in the 2024 presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.6 percent while the broader S&P 500 rose 2.5 percent the day after the election, further boosting an already bullish year for stocks.\nLingering concerns about inflation and the broader U.S. economy were top of mind for voters heading into November. Now, investors are leaning into “Trump Trade 2.0,” fueled by anticipated pro-business policies, tax cuts and deregulation under a unified Republican government.\nTrump’s win took place against a backdrop of economic anxiety. Bankrate’s October 2024 Politics and Economy Survey revealed that 41 percent of Americans named inflation as their top economic concern heading into November. The same survey found a majority (55 percent) of Americans believed the economy is on the “wrong track.”\nWhen asked which presidential candidate would be better for the economy, 45 percent of Americans picked Trump compared to 40 percent who picked Vice President Kamala Harris. Americans also rated Trump higher than Harris on addressing personal financial situations and inflation.\nHowever, the economy was already sizzling prior to the election, as Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Marc Hamrick points out.\n“We saw new highs for the stock market’s major averages, falling inflation, the Federal Reserve shifting into easing mode and a job market close to the level associated with full employment,” he says.\nBut how people feel about their finances doesn’t always mesh with broader economic data.\n“Perceptions about where we stand are far apart,” says Hamrick. “Some of that has little to do with the broader economy.”\nThe Trump Trade describes the shift in market sentiment in response to President-elect Trump’s proposed economic policies.\nWith a GOP majority in Congress, Trump’s incoming administration has pledged to roll out an agenda focused on tax cuts, deregulation and other business-friendly measures.\nHere’s a closer look at how stocks and other investments have performed in the wake of Trump’s win.\nStocks across multiple sectors surged post-election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 logged their strongest months of 2024 in November. Meanwhile, the small-cap-heavy Russell 2000 took the lead, surging 10.8 percent for the month as investors anticipated small companies benefiting from Trump’s proposed tax cuts.\nShares in energy and financial companies also rallied, as these sectors stand to benefit the most from deregulation.\nBut some of the biggest beneficiaries of the Trump Trade are companies tied to Trump, his family or his close associates.\nShares of Tesla (TSLA), the electric vehicle maker led by Trump advisor and campaign donor Elon Musk, jumped nearly 17 percent the day after the election. By Nov. 16, Tesla’s stock had soared over 40 percent since Election Day.\nThe stock rallied despite Trump’s dismissive stance on electric vehicles — Tesla’s flagship product — and his promises to claw back incentives and regulations that have fueled the company’s profitability.\nShares of the crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) skyrocketed nearly 39 percent after the election, reflecting Trump’s recent embrace of cryptocurrency as a key piece of his 2024 platform.\nMeanwhile, crypto companies and wealthy investors poured millions into U.S. congressional races. A super PAC named Fairshake, along with affiliated groups Protect Progress and Defend American Jobs, collectively contributed around $135 million to support pro-crypto candidates, according to The New York Times. Much of the funding originated from donations by crypto companies Coinbase and Ripple.\nAnother big post-election mover was Trump Media. Shares of Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of the Truth Social platform, shot up over 46 percent between Nov. 4, the day before the election, and Nov. 6, the day after. However, the rally was short-lived, with the stock giving up most of its gains and hovering around $30 per share for the rest of November.\nThe broader stock market rally is expected to continue through the end of 2024.\nStocks historically perform well in December, a phenomenon known as the Santa Claus rally — another green light for a market already excited about the potential for deregulation and corporate tax cuts.\nU.S. stocks — especially in tech, financials, industrials and energy — saw significant gains during Trump’s first term. However, the stock market performed just as well under President Joe Biden as it did under Trump.\nIn fact, cumulative and annualized returns of the S&P 500 index, a measure of the nation’s 500 largest companies, was nearly identical under both administrations, with a 58.4 percent cumulative gain under Trump and a 58.5 percent gain under Biden.\nYear\nReturn\n2017\n19.4%\n2018\n-6.2%\n2019\n28.9%\n2020\n16.3%\nYear\nReturn\n2021\n26.9%\n2022\n-19.4%\n2023\n24.2%\n2024*\n26.8%\n*Year-to-date return as of Dec. 3.\nTrump’s pledges of tax cuts, deregulation and government spending may have energized stock investors, but they’ve unsettled bond markets, where concerns about inflation loom large, especially under a pro-tariff president-elect.\nThese worries were evident in rising government bond yields, which began climbing in August as a Trump victory became more plausible. The day after the election, the yield on the 10-year Treasury spiked to 4.43 percent, up from 4.29 percent late Tuesday — a significant move for the bond market.\nWhile the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy impacts most U.S. interest rates — including those on Treasury bonds — its influence diminishes over longer-term bonds. Investors in these bonds focus more on long-term growth and inflation prospects rather than current Fed policy.\nSome experts predict that the Federal Reserve may keep rates elevated in 2025 to counter inflation from fiscal expansion.\nBy the end of November, bond yields eased, with the 10-year Treasury yield dipping to 4.2 percent.\nFollowing Trump’s win in 2016, expectations of more government spending and a hawkish Federal Reserve also led to rising Treasury yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield went from 1.82 percent in November 2016 to 3.23 percent in November 2018, then dropped.\nThe current bond market’s outlook remains more uncertain than the stock market’s outlook. If the Fed delays rate cuts, bond yields could rise further. This scenario could create a double-edged sword: While stocks rally on pro-growth policies, bond markets could face turbulence.\nThe U.S. dollar has been on the rise, climbing roughly 1.5 percent against major currencies immediately following Trump’s victory. By Nov. 22, the broad-based dollar index had jumped 4 percent since Election Day — a big move in such a short time. From late September through mid-November 2024, the dollar gained over 7 percent.\nA stronger dollar benefits American consumers by lowering the cost of imported goods and making international travel more affordable.\nHowever, it poses headaches for U.S. exporters because their products become less competitive globally. And the biggest perks of a stronger dollar — increased purchasing power for American consumers and businesses — can be wiped out when coupled with rising interest rates and higher inflation.\nThe U.S. dollar appreciated against other major currencies during Trump’s first term, driven by expectations of stronger economic growth. While the dollar was healthy during most of his term — especially from January to March 2017 — it wasn’t “the strongest dollar in history,” as Trump frequently claimed and PolitiFact debunked.\nThe rapid gains of the stock market pale in comparison to cryptocurrency’s moon-shot rise post-election.\nBitcoin’s price jumped 8.4 percent the day after the election, reaching a record-breaking $76,480 and shattering its previous high from March. By Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) surged to $89,600 and kept climbing, flirting with the long-awaited $100,000 milestone throughout November. In December, it finally crossed that threshold.\nAnd it wasn’t just Bitcoin — other major cryptocurrencies joined the rally, with Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) also making notable gains post-election.\nThese recent moves cap off a banner year for Bitcoin, which is up a whopping 118 percent in 2024 as of Dec. 3.\nTrump came out big for crypto in 2024. Once a skeptic, he rebranded as the pro-Bitcoin candidate, vowing to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” and a Bitcoin “superpower” during a high-profile speech at a Nashville cryptocurrency conference in July.\nTrump’s crypto-friendly agenda includes plans for a federal Bitcoin stockpile, looser regulations and ousting SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose tenure has been marked by aggressive oversight of the industry.\nJust weeks before the election, Trump backed a new crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, a project with ties to several Trump family members.\nThe election left some companies and sectors in the dust following Trump’s win. Vaccine makers and healthcare companies, such as Eli Lilly (LLY) and Pfizer (PFE), saw their share prices plummet in mid-November after Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a vocal vaccine and Big Pharma critic — to be the U.S. Health Secretary.\nInternational stocks also slumped as markets digested Trump’s tariff-heavy rhetoric post-election. The president-elect has called for immediate 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada once he takes office, alongside a 10 percent levy on goods from China. These proposals have raised concerns about trade tensions and potential disruptions to international supply chains, souring investor sentiment on global stocks.\nWith Republicans in control of the executive and legislative branches, the markets are pricing in a business-friendly environment and promises of a strong economy. However, investors should remain cautious. While the Trump Trade is generating buzz, economic fundamentals will ultimately determine its staying power."

        "article_content": "The tensions between Jerome Powell and Donald Trump appear to be cooling.\nFor now.\nThe president-elect said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press that he has no plans to remove Powell before the Federal Reserve chair's term is up in May 2026.\n\"I don’t see it,\" he said.\nThat came just days after Powell said that he hoped for a good relationship with the new Trump White House and Trump’s nominee for Treasury secretary, who earlier this year suggested in an interview that Trump could appoint a \"shadow chair\" to undermine Powell’s influence.\n\"I fully expect that we’ll have the same general kinds of relationships, institutional relationships, for example with the Council of Economic Advisers, but most importantly with the Treasury Department,\" Powell said Wednesday at the New York Times DealBook Summit in New York.\nThe commentary from both men is remarkably more conciliatory than the language they used previously this year.\nTrump on the campaign trail regularly weighed in with criticisms of Powell, offering that the president should \"have a say\" in Fed decisions and that Powell has \"gotten it wrong a lot.\"\nAfter Trump’s reelection win in November, Powell himself aggressively rebuffed the possibility of being removed.\n\"Not permitted under the law,\" the central bank chair said on Nov. 7 to reporters who asked about his views on any legal authorities Trump might have in terms of firing or demoting him or any other top Fed officials.\n\"No,\" he said at another point in a press conference on the question of whether he would leave, sounding perturbed.\nWhether this detente can last is still an open question, especially if the Fed reaches a point where it decides it has to start raising interest rates again.\nPowell's Fed has cut rates twice this fall and is widely expected to lower rates at its next meeting on Dec. 18, although central bank officials will no doubt be watching this release of key inflation data this week before making their decision.\nFed officials are also expected to pull back their predictions for rate cuts in 2025 due to a strong economy and the persistence of inflation pressures.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has sent mixed signals for years on whether he would aim to fire or demote Powell.\nDuring his first term, then-President Trump attacked Powell with regularity (even though it was Trump who had elevated him to his current role) and openly pushed for the actions he wanted, even once suggesting negative interest rates.\nTrump reiterated the idea of firing Powell in a 2020 news conference when he bluntly said, \"I have the right to remove\" Powell. He added that he could also demote Powell from his position as chair, \"put him in a regular position, and put somebody else in charge.\"\nIt’s an unsettled legal question, though, with many experts falling on Powell's side of the argument.\nAt issue is Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act. The law states that each member of the board shall hold office for 14 years \"unless sooner removed for cause by the President.\"\nRead more: How much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates?\nThe statute doesn't have any language that specifically addresses the chairman of the Board of Governors. The question that has been debated for years is what exactly constitutes \"for cause.\"\nThe language in the law is plainly more restrictive for Fed officials than it is for Cabinet officials and other members of a presidential administration, who are often described as working \"at the pleasure\" of the president.\nLegal experts have tended to say that a simple policy disagreement wouldn't rise to the level of cause, but it's a standard that hasn't been tested with a judge.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "(Bloomberg) -- Former president Donald Trump’s social media startup gained 16% in its first trading day as a public company, after the most high-profile blank-check deal in years added billions to his fortune — at least on paper.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead\nTrump Media’s Business Doesn’t Matter\nTrump Got His $175 Million Bond From a Billionaire Fan’s Company\nIran Vows to Punish Israel for Strike on Embassy in Syria\nTesla Disappoints Analysts by Most Ever in Brutal Blow for EVs\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. rose as much as 59% before paring gains, closing at $57.99 each on Tuesday. The trading after the closing of the merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. values the unprofitable company at $7.9 billion, capping an eye-popping meme stock run, and providing a potential windfall for Trump as he faces a mounting series of legal and financial woes.\nTrump’s nearly 60% stake in the unprofitable company behind Truth Social may ultimately be worth more than $6 billion, based on its filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, he can’t sell the stake immediately due to a six-month lock-up agreement, hindering his ability to monetize the shares and ease his present cash crunch. As much as $1.6 billion of that paper wealth is also dependent on shares meeting performance requirements.\nRead More: Trump Wealth Hits Record $6.5 Billion on SPAC, Slashed Bond\nThe company’s post-merger performance on the Nasdaq under the symbol DJT will test Trump’s ability to capture the attention of individual traders and momentum investors who use it as a way to bet on his push for re-election.\nIt has become the most expensive US stock to sell short, with short sellers paying over 200 times the average cost to borrow the shares, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.\nRead More: Trump Media Is Now the Most Expensive US Stock to Bet Against\nTraders piled into the stock on Tuesday in a session that was briefly halted for volatility, with nearly 54 million shares changing hands — close to 12 times its average 10-day volume, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nAfter two years of snags on the way to a listing, however, including investigations from the Justice Department and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the money-losing company may have difficulty convincing some investors focused on the long term.\nIts operations have so far struggled to generate a profit, losing $49 million in the nine months through September while delivering just $3.4 million in revenue.\n“The underlying business fundamentals will matter at some point. The stock can defy gravity for only so long,” said Julian Klymochko, chief executive officer of Accelerate Financial Technologies. “DJT is the mother of all meme stocks.”\nLegal Troubles\nThe potential funds come at a critical time for Trump, who is paying millions of dollars a month to fund his ongoing legal troubles. He’s set for the first of his criminal trials on April 15, and a New York judge has already imposed an order banning him from making statements about witnesses, lawyers or jurors.\nSeparately, Trump was ordered by a different judge last month to pay $454 million after a civil ruling that he had fraudulently inflated his wealth for years. While a New York appeals court agreed on Monday to slash the amount the former president would have to put up as a bond while he contests the verdict, he is still required to post $175 million within 10 days.\nAs the Trump Media deal became a political lightning rod, retail investors embraced the company and its stated mission fighting against big tech companies like Meta Platforms Inc., Netflix Inc., and Elon Musk’s X, even as the merger’s winding multi-year path to completion triggered a wave of skepticism from most of Wall Street.\nThe SPAC soared 185% this year through Monday’s close in anticipation of the merger, mirroring Trump’s electoral fortunes as he bulldozed his way toward the Republican presidential nomination.\nBut unless management moves to expedite the process, Trump and other Trump Media insiders with stakes can’t sell any shares for roughly six months.\nThe seven-person Trump Media board of directors, the group that would potentially give the green light to the former president to sell shares before September, is made up of a range of ex-members of his administration. Among them are former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, former head of the Small Business Administration Linda McMahon and former Trump defense official Kash Patel.\nDevin Nunes, a former California Representative who left Congress to become CEO of Trump Media, Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. and Digital World’s CEO Eric Swider are among the other board members.\nMeme Stock\nIn the lead-up to the deal’s completion, Trump Media had warned it could go bankrupt without the SPAC merger. Having avoided that fate, the next challenge will be avoiding the fate doled out to many so-called meme stocks — a name coined during the height of the pandemic for companies whose trading appears detached from reality.\nIf Trump and other insiders sell shares before the six-month lock-up period, it could trigger a selloff as the market would likely be inundated by sellers.\nRead More: SPACs With Small Floats Use Meme-Stock Playbook for Crazy Swings\n“A problem for meme stocks is that the supply of shares that are tradeable, known as the public float, rather than the fundamental value of a share, is an important determinant of the price,” said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. With the shares available for trading potentially accounting for just a small percentage of the total outstanding, a sale by Trump or other insiders after the lock-up ends could spark a rapid decline.\n“In the short run, anything can happen,” said Ritter. “But buying an overvalued stock hoping to sell it at any even higher price is known as the greater fool theory of investing.”\n(Updates throughout with closing price.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite Wok\nHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards\nBuilding Diversity When Affirmative Action Is Banned\nFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto\nEclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

        "title": "Trump vowed to oust SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, and these crypto advocates could take his place",
        "date": "2024-11-10T09:33:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Gary Gensler is likely headed for the exit, and possible replacements for the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman are being floated by Trump’s transition team.\nWhile Trump in July promised to fire Gensler on day one of his second administration, he technically can’t remove Gensler (without cause) until his term ends in 2026. But at the center of the president-elect’s focus for hiring a new SEC chief is the issue of cryptocurrency.\nAmong the people that some are speculating could take Gensler’s place is Dan Gallagher, Reuters reported. He previously worked as an SEC commissioner and is currently the chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer of Robinhood Markets. Gallagher has criticized Gensler’s SEC and asked for changes to the way the agency approaches crypto regulation.\nIn September, Gallagher spoke before Congress during a hearing titled “Dazed and Confused: Breaking Down the SEC’s Politicized Approach to Digital Assets.” During his prepared remarks Gallagher called out Gensler and said the SEC has fostered “innovation-killing federal regulatory uncertainty.”\n“The SEC has engaged in regulation by enforcement, which is bad for American consumers who want greater access to digital assets. It's bad for the innovation in the blockchain and digital asset industries, and it is bad for the already eroding and competitive position of the U.S. with regard to digital asset markets,” he said during the hearing.\nRobinhood did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nAccording to Reuters, another possible candidate to take the reins of the SEC is Paul Atkins, who was a part of Trump’s 2016 transition team and also previously served as an SEC commissioner. He is currently the CEO of consultancy Patomak Global Partners.\nSince 2017, Atkins has served as a co-chair of the Token Alliance, which is an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. The chamber is dedicated to promoting the “the acceptance and use of digital assets and blockchain-based technologies,” according to its website.\nDuring an interview with crypto media outlet CoinDesk in 2022, Atkins said he agreed with the SEC and Gensler’s position that Bitcoin is not a security but also criticized Gensler’s approach of regulating crypto.\n“The way the SEC is doing this, as regulation through enforcement, or threatening to, is a real problem,” he said.\nPatomak Global Partners did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nOther reports have flagged names like Mark Uyeda, who started a second term as an SEC commissioner in January. Uyeda has been a commissioner since 2022 when he was nominated by President Biden.\nHe also has worked in several roles at the agency, including as senior adviser to former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and counsel to Atkins when he was a commissioner in the early 2000s.\nUyeda has been critical of the SEC’s approach to crypto as well. In an October interview with Fox Business, he called the agency’s crypto policies a “disaster,” adding that it had done nothing to clarify crypto rules.\nHe also advocated for change at the top of the SEC to reform its agenda on crypto in a Fox Business interview this week.\n\"The Commission’s war on crypto must end, including crypto enforcement actions solely based on a failure to register with no allegation of fraud or harm,\" he said during the interview. \"President Trump and the American electorate have sent a clear message. Starting in 2025, the SEC’s role is to carry out that mandate.\"\nTrump-Vance Transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to Fortune that no decision has been made on Trump’s appointees\nAlthough during his first term as president in 2019 Trump declared he was “not a fan” of cryptocurrency and said digital currencies are “not money,” he has changed his mind since then.\nTrump actively embraced crypto during his 2024 presidential campaign, and has also gotten in on the action first-hand, launching his own NFT projects that reportedly netted him millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency and licensing fees.\nMeanwhile, Gensler has been successful in reaching giant settlements with some crypto companies, including the landmark $4.5 billion deal with Terraform Labs and its cofounder Do Kwon in June.\nYet, many crypto industry leaders have faulted the SEC chairman’s approach, criticizing the agency for not providing clear guidance on crypto and filing lawsuits against companies that have strived to comply with SEC rules.\nIn October, Gensler hinted that he may be willing to step aside.\n\"Democracies have consequences, but we're going to continue to do that which we do well at the SEC until, as I say, the ref calls the whistle,\" the SEC chairman said during a Las Vegas financial technology convention, Reuters reported. \"Traditionally, presidents decide who chairs the SEC. That's a good part of democracy.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "With a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, Google’s parent company, Alphabet (GOOGL), stands as a dominant force in the tech industry. However, this dominance has drawn increasing scrutiny, as the company faces mounting pressure from antitrust authorities.\nFormer president Donald Trump has also weighed in with a stark warning for the tech giant.\nSocial Security isn’t enough: start collecting monthly retirement rent checks by becoming the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger — and you can do it without lifting a finger\nNervous about November? Use these 3 ‘shockproof assets’ to protect your retirement nest egg in 2025 — no matter who takes the White Houses\nProtect your retirement savings with these 5 essential money moves — most of which you can complete in just minutes\n“Google has been very bad, they’ve been very irresponsible, and I have a feeling that Google is going to be close to shut down, because I don’t think Congress is going to take it,” Trump said during a recent interview with Fox’s Maria Bartiromo.\nTrump’s remarks followed his observation that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had called after the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, while \"nobody called from Google.\" He further cautioned that the company “has to be careful.”\nMeanwhile, authorities have begun taking action.\nIn August, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google violated antitrust laws through its search business, declaring the tech giant a “monopolist.”\n“After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act,” Mehta wrote.\nThe ruling pointed to Google’s immense market power, with the Department of Justice highlighting its “immense revenues and large profit margins.” Google commands an 89.2% share of the general search services market by query volume, a figure that jumps to 94.9% on mobile devices. The company has held an over 80% share since at least 2009.\nThe White House praised the decision.\n“This pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. “As President Biden and Vice President Harris have long said, Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.”\nGoogle’s president of global affairs, Kent Walker, responded by announcing the company’s intention to appeal.\n“As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use,” Walker wrote in a post on X.\nSearch plays a pivotal role for both Google and its parent company, Alphabet. In 2023, \"Google Search & other\" generated $175 billion, representing a significant 57% of Alphabet's total revenue.\nRead more: Why people who work with a financial advisor retire with an extra $1.3 million\nThe DOJ recently proposed significant remedies to curb Google’s power in the search engine market, including the possibility of breaking up the tech giant.\nAccording to a new court filing, the DOJ is “considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants.”\nThe DOJ is also exploring measures to restrict or eliminate default search engine agreements, preinstallation deals, and revenue-sharing arrangements tied to Google’s search products. Google currently has high-profile search agreements with Apple’s iPhone and Samsung devices. One potential remedy is introducing a “choice screen,” which would allow users to choose from a range of alternative search engines.\nGoogle’s vice president of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, called the DOJ’s proposals “radical” and criticized the department for overreach.\n“This case is about a set of search distribution contracts. Rather than focus on that, the government seems to be pursuing a sweeping agenda that will impact numerous industries and products, with significant unintended consequences for consumers, businesses, and American competitiveness,” Mulholland wrote in a blog post.\nMulholland emphasized that Google has invested billions of dollars into Chrome and Android, arguing that few companies would have the resources or incentive to maintain them as open-source platforms or to invest at the scale Google has. \"Splitting off Chrome or Android would break them — along with many other things,\" she warned.\nAlphabet shares initially dropped following news of the potential breakup, but the decline was short-lived. Year to date, the stock is up 19%, with a 168% gain over the past five years.\nDespite the DOJ's suggestions, some experts remain skeptical about a breakup. Daniel Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that despite the antitrust scrutiny, a breakup of Google is \"unlikely at this point\" and that Google “will battle this in the courts for years.\"\nHere's how much the average 60-year old American has in retirement savings — how does your nest egg compare?\nSuze Orman: If you think you're ready to retire, think again — 3 critical money moves to avoid a financial crisis in retirement\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do?

        "article_content": "Donald Trump’s transition team has reportedly looked at ways to shrink or eliminate banking oversight - a move that could have dramatic impacts on everyday Americans and protecting their money.\nIn interviews with candidates to oversee the banking sector, Trump advisers and DOGE - the advisory Department of Government Efficiency - officials have asked if the president-elect can abolish the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., according to the Wall Street Journal.\nTrump’s team has also asked if the FDIC could be absorbed into the Treasury Department.\nAny move to eliminate the FDIC would require Congressional approval. But, if it were to happen, it would be a massive shakeup in the industry.\nThe FDIC was created during the Great Depression. It is designed to help bulk up faith in the nation’s banking system. Most people know the agency as it insures deposits in banks up to $250,000.\nSo if there was a run on a bank or one would collapse, people with up to $250,000 wouldn’t lose their money because it’s insured by the federal government.\nIf the FDIC went away, everyday people could lose that insurance or guarantees that their money will still be available in the event of a bank run or collapse.\nThe WSJ report notes that while banks hope Trump will ease regulations, the FDIC insurance is considered “near sacred.” A move to eliminate that deposit insurance could cause panic among customers - and cause people to demand their money so it’s no longer at risk.\nLast year, several banks failed and it caused customers to shift their money to big banks and away from smaller groups.\nSources told the WSJ that Trump’s team, which includes DOGE advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, have also asked nominees about combining or restructuring bank regulators, including the FDIC and Federal Reserve.\nHowever, former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair said any proposal to eliminate a bank regulator would struggle to gain support in Congress.\n“Banks may complain, but at the end of the day, they like to have their own regulator they have a relationship with,” Bair told the WSJ. “They like the status quo.”\nMajor changes to bank regulations are uncommon outside of a financial crisis, according to the WSJ. Most of today’s bank rules were created after the Great Recession and Great Depression.\nDemocrats led the last major push to close a bank regulator with Congress ending the Office of Thrift Supervision - which oversaw lenders before the housing crisis in 2008 - and folded the agency into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency."

        "date": "2024-11-30T16:07:56.000Z",
        "article_content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A tax break for millionaires, and almost everyone else.\nAn end to the COVID-19-era government subsidies that some Americans have used to purchase health insurance.\nLimits to food stamps, including for women and children, and other safety net programs. Rollbacks to Biden-era green energy programs. Mass deportations. Government job cuts to “drain the swamp.”\nHaving won the election and sweeping to power, Republicans are planning an ambitious 100-day agenda with President-elect Donald Trump in the White House and GOP lawmakers in a congressional majority to accomplish their policy goals.\nAtop the list is the plan to renew some $4 trillion in expiring GOP tax cuts, a signature domestic achievement of Trump's first term and an issue that may define his return to the White House.\n“What we’re focused on right now is being ready, Day 1,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., after meeting recently with GOP colleagues to map out the road ahead.\nThe policies emerging will revive long-running debates about America's priorities, its gaping income inequities and the proper size and scope of its government, especially in the face of mounting federal deficits now approaching $2 trillion a year.\nThe discussions will test whether Trump and his Republican allies can achieve the kinds of real-world outcomes wanted, needed or supported when voters gave the party control of Congress and the White House.\n“The past is really prologue here,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, recalling the 2017 tax debate.\nTrump’s first term became defined by those tax cuts, which were approved by Republicans in Congress and signed into law only after their initial campaign promise to “repeal and replace” Democratic President Barack Obama's health care law sputtered, failing with the famous thumbs-down vote by then-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.\nThe GOP majority in Congress quickly pivoted to tax cuts, assembling and approving the multitrillion-dollar package by year’s end.\nIn the time since Trump signed those cuts into law, the big benefits have accrued to higher-income households. The top 1 percent — those making nearly $1 million and above — received about a $60,000 income tax cut, while those with lower incomes got as little as a few hundred dollars, according to the Tax Policy Center and other groups. Some people ended up paying about the same.\n“The big economic story in the U.S. is soaring income inequality,” said Owens. “And that is actually, interestingly, a tax story.”\nIn preparation for Trump’s return, Republicans in Congress have been meeting privately for months and with the president-elect to go over proposals to extend and enhance those tax breaks, some of which would otherwise expire in 2025.\nThat means keeping in place various tax brackets and a standardized deduction for individual earners, along with the existing rates for so-called pass-through entities such as law firms, doctors' offices or businesses that take their earnings as individual income.\nTypically, the price tag for the tax cuts would be prohibitive. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that keeping the expiring provisions in place would add some $4 trillion to deficits over a decade.\nAdding to that, Trump wants to include his own priorities in the tax package, including lowering the corporate rate, now at 21% from the 2017 law, to 15%, and doing away with individual taxes on tips and overtime pay.\nBut Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, said blaming the tax cuts for the nation's income inequality is “just nonsense” because tax filers up and down the income ladder benefited. He instead points to other factors, including the Federal Reserve's historically low interest rates that enable borrowing, including for the wealthy, on the cheap.\n“Americans don’t care if Elon Musk is rich,” Roy said. “What they care about is, what are you doing to make their lives better?”\nTypically, lawmakers want the cost of a policy change to be offset by budget revenue or reductions elsewhere. But in this case, there's almost no agreed-upon revenue raisers or spending cuts in the annual $6 trillion budget that could cover such a whopping price tag.\nInstead, some Republicans have argued that the tax breaks will pay for themselves, with the trickle-down revenue from potential economic growth. Trump’s tariffs floated this past week could provide another source of offsetting revenue.\nSome Republicans argue there's precedent for simply extending the tax cuts without offsetting the costs because they are not new changes but existing federal policy.\n“If you’re just extending current law, we’re not raising taxes or lowering taxes,\" said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, on Fox News.\nHe said the criticism that tax cuts would add to the deficit is “ridiculous.” There is a difference between taxes and spending, he said, \"and we just have to get that message out to America.”\nAt the same time, the new Congress will also be considering spending reductions, particularly to food stamps and health care programs, goals long sought by conservatives as part of the annual appropriations process.\nOne cut is almost certain to fall on the COVID-19-era subsidy that helps defray the cost of health insurance for people who buy their own policies via the Affordable Care Act exchange.\nThe extra health care subsidies were extended through 2025 in Democratic President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which also includes various green energy tax breaks that Republicans want to roll back.\nThe House Democratic leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, scoffed at the Republican claim that they've won “some big, massive mandate” — when in fact, the House Democrats and Republicans essentially fought to a draw in the November election, with the GOP eking out a narrow majority.\n“This notion about some mandate to make massive, far-right extreme policy changes, it doesn't exist — it doesn't exist,” Jeffries said.\nRepublicans are planning to use a budgetary process, called reconciliation, that allows majority passage in Congress, essentially along party lines, without the threat of a filibuster in the Senate that can stall out a bill’s advance unless 60 of the 100 senators agree.\nIt’s the same process Democrats have used when they had the power in Washington to approve the Inflation Reduction Act and Obama's health care law over GOP objections.\nRepublicans have been here before with Trump and control of Congress, which is no guarantee they will be able to accomplish their goals, particularly in the face of resistance from Democrats.\nStill, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who has been working closely with Trump on the agenda, has promised a “breakneck” pace in the first 100 days “because we have a lot to fix.”\n___\nThe story has been corrected to reflect that Lindsay Owens of the Groundwork Collaborative spoke of ‘income inequality,' not ‘income equality.’"

        "date": "2024-11-08T13:23:41.000Z",
        "article_content": "With Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election, the US and global renewable energy markets anticipate a potential storm ahead.\nThe election result has already sent tremors through the renewables industry. US solar stocks tumbled on Wednesday, with companies like First Solar dropping 10%, while Sunrun and Sunnova plunged more than 29% and 51%, respectively.\nDespite Trump not having made clear his stance on solar, investors reacted to his broader promise to eliminate green subsidies. The former president has pledged to dismantle the IRA, a cornerstone of Joe Biden’s $369bn clean energy initiative and a legislation that has played a key role in the expansion of renewables deployment in the country.\nOn the other hand, Trump’s disdain for wind power is no secret. He famously declared “I hate wind” and promised to halt offshore wind projects immediately upon returning to office. His Agenda47 policy platform reiterates his vow to “end all Joe Biden policies that disrupt energy markets... including the outrageous subsidies for wind energy”.\nTrump's victory reverberates far beyond US borders, sending shockwaves through global markets and testing international alliances. As his administration prepares to reverse climate policies and reshape the renewables landscape, both domestic and international markets brace for the wider implications for clean energy initiatives and geopolitical stability.\nIn addition to US renewables companies taking the hit, Trump’s victory has shaken global markets. European clean energy stocks fell sharply following the election, with wind turbine manufacturers Vestas and Nordex trading down around 11% and 7.6%, respectively, while Orsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer, saw a decline of up to 14%. \nThe US renewable energy market has long represented a significant growth opportunity for utility companies across the globe. Trump’s shift in policy could dampen this upward trajectory, alongside the global momentum on emission reductions.\n“The likely shift in US policy impacts global climate governance as US climate leadership pushes other major economies toward emission reduction commitments and supports developing countries in their green transitions,” says Paul Hasselbrinck, senior energy analyst at Power Technology’s parent company GlobalData.\nBeyond the stock market, Trump’s stance on renewables could strain alliances with key climate-focused partners such as the EU, Canada and Japan. Hasselbrinck points to US-Europe relations as being particularly vulnerable to “suffering from turbulence on the diplomatic side”, paired with “dwindling support for NATO and the unlikely easing of protectionist policies”.\nHe adds, however, that these geopolitical tensions may be counter-balanced by the US’ willingness to sell liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe and Europe’s demand for it, which could support the need for good relations. \n“However, as a result, European countries may find themselves under increased pressure to reduce overall gas demand, turning to renewables at a quicker pace to avoid being subject to the leverage of an administration that will be – at least partially – at odds with the Union’s stance on Russia-Ukraine conflict resolution, and increasingly, on Israel-Palestine.”\nChina’s control over critical minerals as well as the manufacture of energy-related equipment and infrastructure pose a significant challenge for the US renewables industry.\n“The supply chain vulnerabilities have been spotted: solar and wind-powered electricity generation requires the kind of critical materials that China overwhelmingly dominates,” Hasselbrinck says.\nFor instance, China is responsible for nearly 40% of the global share of processing for copper, which is essential for not only renewables but also nuclear, coal and natural gas. The Asian nation also dominates around 90% of global processing for manganese, used for onshore and offshore wind.\nHasselbrinck claims that Trump’s solution to this conundrum will “look radically different from his opposing candidate and predecessor” as the options of safeguarding a good relationship with China to avoid supply chain disruptions and price-controls, in addition to establishing strong strategic partnerships with other key suppliers, “will seem less enticing to him”.\nRather than fostering international partnerships or diversifying supply chains, Trump is likely to focus on reducing US reliance on imports by boosting domestic production of traditional energy sources, further sidelining renewables. This could exacerbate supply chain vulnerabilities, as clean energy industries remain dependent on critical minerals for which the US lacks immediate alternatives.\n“Trump’s practical – if not simplistic – approach means that renewables investments may decrease even more in response to uncertainty and lack of government support,” Hasselbrinck adds.\nDespite the concerns, all hope is not lost when it comes to the growth of renewables in the US.\nData from the Global Infrastructure Investor Association shows that the IRA has spurred around $115bn in investments and generated roughly 90,000 jobs, the majority of which benefitted Republican-led states.\nWhile this surge in investment and job creation is now in jeopardy considering Trump’s stance of renewables and the IRA, states that the bill has paid off for – many of which politically align with Trump – are likely to push back against his plans to gut the bill. With bipartisan recognition of its economic benefits, there is a strong possibility that at least parts of the IRA will survive his term.\nFurthermore, Trump’s opposition to the IRA conflicts with his fixation on curbing China's influence. \nThe solar industry has been a significant beneficiary of the IRA. According to the US Solar Market Insight Q3 2024 report, US solar module manufacturing capacity has surged nearly fourfold since the enactment of the IRA, rising from around 8GW in 2021 to more than 30GW. While this growth hasn't extended up the supply chain to include cells or wafers, it has helped reduce the US's dependence on China – an achievement that should satisfy the former president.\nThe nation has also almost doubled total installed solar capacity through the IRA’s support. GlobalData projects US cumulative solar capacity will reach 220.95GW by the end of the year, compared with 120.47GW in 2021.\nMeanwhile, China is expected to surpass 850GW of solar capacity by the end of 2024. If Trump’s administration fully enacts its agenda, the nation risks falling even further behind its Asian competitor in the clean energy race.\nIt is possible that this is simply a battle that Trump is willing to lose. Whether the US stalls its renewables growth and widens the gap between itself and global competitors will depend on the degree of resistance his policies face and how far they are implemented.\n\"Trump’s victory: US and global renewable markets brace for storm\" was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n \nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "date": "2024-10-23T20:08:56.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump is often described as a showman, but he is also a salesman who takes advantage of every opportunity presented to him, even selling Bibles, sneakers and a variety of products emblazoned with his mugshot. A new business venture bearing his name, however, may be in legal trouble because of its use of an image that belongs to The Associated Press.\nLast month, Trump announced on social media that a series of premium watches bearing his name and signature were for sale on the website Gettrumpwatches.com. The announcement set off a media investigation into who is behind the watches, some of which were offered for $100,000. CNN tried to solve the mystery of who is making money on the watches, and traced the LLC’s address to a strip mall in Wyoming. Trump himself has nothing to do with the watches, beyond promoting them and granting license to his name; the Trump campaign has said it isn’t involved with the venture, per The Independent in the U.K.\nThe Gettrumpwatches website has a disclaimer that says, “Trump Watches are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals. TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC uses the ‘Trump’ name, image and likeness under a paid license agreement which may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.”\nSomewhat amusingly, the disclaimer also says, “These watches are not political and have nothing to do with any political campaign.”\nAs Matt Giles reported for Wired, some of the watches offered on the website feature a likeness of Trump holding his fist in the air, similar to the now famous photo taken of him right after the July 13 shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. That photo was taken by Evan Vucci, a Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer employed by The Associated Press, and AP owns the rights to the image.\nAccording to Wired, “... TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC advertised a product it can’t deliver, as that image is owned by the 178-year-old news agency. This week, the AP told Wired it is pursuing a cease and desist against the LLC, which is registered in Sheridan, Wyoming.” Giles reported that the company was registered in July, “it is unclear who actually owns or is associated with the LLC,” and no one had responded to a request for comment.\nBut the website currently makes no mention of the image in question, and doesn’t show it, even on the landing page for the $799 “Fight, Fight, Fight” watch, which is marked as “sold out.”\nTrump himself has not promoted the watches recently on X, instead suggesting that people buy Melania Trump’s memoir and a crypto-like token called WLFI that Nellie Bowles at The Free Press called “unfathomably scammy” because it can’t be sold or used as currency.\nThe most underreported story in Trump merch, however, might be that the famous MAGA red cap now comes in a variety of colors to include turquoise, green apple, royal blue and pink, via the official Trump store."

        "date": "2024-12-03T19:30:18.000Z",
        "article_content": "Ever heard of PSQ Holdings, or PublicSquare? It’s an online marketplace that prides itself as a company that serves “customers and businesses that value life, family, and freedom,” which seems in line with a well-known someone who might be joining its board, if the reports are true: Donald Trump Jr., son of the once and future president. Either way, the rumor has sent the stock soaring.\nBloomberg reported that Trump Jr. could join the board as early as Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Nothing has been confirmed or formally announced yet, but the chatter alone doubled the holding company’s stock price in morning trading. It’s interesting because in the past year, its shares have been trending downward. Of course it’s unclear how long this rally will last, but as of Tuesday afternoon the stock is trading at about $4 a share.\nPSQ did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nIt just so happens PSQ’s headquarters is minutes away from the center of the political universe: the president-elect’s primary residence, Mar-a-Lago, where politicians and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, have gathered in recent days.\nThis isn’t the first time the Trump name has pushed a company’s stock. Last week, Unusual Machines, a company that manufactures and sells drones and drone parts, announced Trump Jr. was to become part of its advisory board. Shares rose by more than 100% on the news, CNBC reported. “The need for drones is obvious. It is also obvious that we must stop buying Chinese drones and Chinese drone parts,” Trump Jr. said in a statement accompanying the press release. “I love what Unusual Machines is doing to bring drone manufacturing jobs back to the USA and am excited to take on a bigger role in the movement.” It’s worth noting, however, Unusual Machine’s stock is currently down as of Tuesday, trading at about $13 a share.\nTrump Jr. appears to hold shares in both companies, per Bloomberg and CNBC. But in an ironic twist, Unusual Machines recently revealed in a financial filing that it’s concerned about the impact tariffs could have on its business—something Donald Trump campaigned on and recently signaled he’d deliver. “President-elect Trump is expected to threaten to and may impose steep tariffs on the importation from China of goods including the drones we use in our B2C business,” it said, referring to its business-to-consumer model. “If there are increased tariffs imposed, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.”\nLast month, Trump Jr. chose to join a venture capital firm rather than be a part of his father’s second administration. The firm, 1789 Capital, appears to invest in companies that appeal to conservative consumers, such as Tucker Carlson’s media venture, the New York Times reported.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-07-29T18:05:59.000Z",
        "article_content": "Former President Trump believes the U.S. dollar is now so strong that it’s interfering with American manufacturers’ attempts to sell goods abroad, but a Macquarie strategist said his policies will boost the currency further.\nRising interest rates and a relatively resilient U.S. economy have helped lift the dollar in recent years. The ICE U.S. dollar index, a leading benchmark for the value of the greenback internationally, has soared nearly 13% since July 2021.\n“We have a big currency problem,” Trump said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, arguing the strong dollar has been a “tremendous burden” on key U.S. businesses.\nHe added that this strength now means “nobody wants to buy our product because it's too expensive,” and made the case that other countries try to keep their currencies “weak all the time” to gain an advantage in exports.\nWhile the former president’s message has sparked fears among some Wall Street analysts that he may seek to artificially weaken the U.S. dollar if elected, Macquarie’s global foreign exchange and rates strategist, Thierry Wizman, believes that’s unlikely.\n“Former U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire for a weaker USD, but his core policies (on immigration, tariffs, taxes) point to a stronger USD,” he wrote in a Monday note to clients.\nTrump has promised to clamp down on immigration, impose tariffs, and institute another round of sizable tax cuts after extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. However, all of these policies would strengthen the dollar by creating inflation that forces real interest rates to rise, according to Wizman.\nThe recent surge in immigration, for example, has helped to ease the labor shortage and push down wage pressure in recent years, helping keep inflation at bay. If Trump’s anti-immigration policies lead to a reduction in migrants into the U.S., that could result in higher inflation, forcing the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer. And because the difference in interest rates between the U.S. and other nations is so critical to the value of the dollar, higher rates will likely strengthen the U.S.’s currency.\nSimilarly, studies show that tariffs serve to increase the price of imports, and therefore, often exacerbate inflation. This can, once again, force the Fed into a more hawkish policy, increasing the value of the dollar.\nFinally, tax cuts tend to juice the economy, boosting corporate spending and investment, which can also result in higher inflation, and as a result, a stronger dollar.\nWizman isn’t alone in his assessment of the potential impact of Trump’s core economic policies on the dollar. AXA Investment Managers’ head of macro research, David Page, argued in a Friday report that Trump’s policies, particularly tariffs, will “make Fed monetary policy easing less likely,” boosting the dollar.\n“The trade-weighted dollar has indeed tracked Trump’s positive net approval ratings over recent years, suggesting the market shares a similar assessment,” he noted.\nWhile Trump’s core economic policies, as forecasted by Wall Street today, are likely to strengthen the U.S. dollar, there are potential direct policy interventions that could weaken it.\nWizman noted that, if elected, Trump could pressure the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates; ask the Treasury Department to sell dollars from its reserves; ask allies to purchase their own currencies instead of the dollar in the open market; impose restrictions on overseas investments into to the U.S.; or offer tariff-free access to U.S. markets—but only for countries that strengthen their own currencies.\nStill, Wizman argued that these interventions are either unlikely to happen or unlikely to work. Trump won’t be able to bully the Fed or the Treasury into changing their policies, for example, at least without a disastrous impact to the U.S. currency's status, he said.\nAnd if the former president were to attempt to curtail direct foreign investment into the U.S., that would lead to manufacturing job losses. “Indeed, Trump has previously said that he favors [foreign direct investment] into the U.S. in support of job creation and higher manufacturing wages in the U.S,” Wizman pointed out.\nFinally, Trump could threaten tariffs against China in an attempt to force President Xi Jinping to devalue the yuan. “But this is more likely to backfire by getting countries to accept the tariffs and devalue their currencies, creating a vicious loop of more tariffs and more USD strength,” the strategist said.\nThe only serious avenue for Trump to devalue the dollar, according to Wizman, involves offering trade concessions to emerging market countries in exchange for them increasing the value of their currencies. “This is possible, but it would…lead to a lowering of tariffs, something which Trump has not yet endorsed as a possibility. Moreover, it would run counter to using the tariff system to raise revenue and defray/offset tax cuts,” Wizman wrote.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-12-06T12:00:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump isn’t even in the Oval Office but the people he has selected to run his regulatory apparatus are promising big changes for deal-making, some good — on balance more approved mergers than what was allowed by the Biden peeps — and some not so good, On The Money has learned.\nOne deal that’s bound to get increased scrutiny is independent studio Skydance’s $28 billion purchase of Paramount, the big but troubled studio and TV empire run by Shari Redstone.\nThat’s because the Trump people keep talking about figuring out ways to slow walk or even kill one of the biggest media deals of the year. The reason is the alleged lefty bias writ-large at one of Paramount’s subsidiaries, CBS. The news network was once considered the gold standard of TV journalism, but increasingly has been seen as a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party.\nThat holds particularly true for Trump supporters and people who will occupy key posts in his administration. They believe that “60 Minutes” edited the word-salad prone Kamala Harris just before the Nov. 5 election to make her sound more cogent. CBS continues to refuse to release a full transcript of the interview, even after a clip of Harris’s bumbling rhetoric appeared in a preview of the segment.\nAnother example involves the internal pressure imposed on “CBS Mornings” anchor Tony Dokoupil after his tough questioning of far-left writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who penned a controversial screed that shockingly attacked Israel for its response to the brutal Oct. 7 massacre of innocent Jews by Hamas terrorists.\nNow the Trump people are demanding answers and maybe more. A few weeks ago, Brendan Carr, Trump’s nominee to chair the Federal Communications Commission, voiced his concern that CBS has violated parts of the administrative code and its “public interest” clause. Telecom executives tell On The Money that Carr continues to let it be known that the FCC, which must approve such mergers, won’t just rubber stamp the transaction.\nCarr might get some support internally to hamper at least the timing of the merger, which is scheduled to close next year, after the nomination of Gail Slater to head of the DOJ’s antitrust division. The longtime telecom lawyer and legislative assistant to VP-elect JD Vance when he was in the Senate is said not to be a friend to big media, and she too might look to throw a monkey wrench into the transaction, sources said.\nPeople at Skydance are apparently taking the threats seriously and could possibly bring in their big gun, and they probably already have, On The Money has heard. That would involve turning to the president-elect’s friend and supporter Larry Ellison, the multi-billionaire Oracle founder and father of Skydance chief David Ellison.\nMy sources say the elder Ellison wants the deal to sail through the approval process, so Skydance can get down to the business of turning around Paramount, severely hampered by cord cutting and declines in advertising, which forced the controlling Redstone family to sell in the first place.\nA Skydance rep had no comment; Carr and Slater could not be reached for comment."

Many of them made their decision based on the belief that he would strengthen the economy. However, many economists and financial experts have been sounding the alarm that Trump’s policies could do more harm than good — potentially a lot more harm.\nBe Aware: The Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Retirees Should Make Before Inauguration Day\nCheck Out: 5 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money That Actually Work\nAnthony Scaramucci occupies a unique position among these critics. He worked in the Trump 1.0 administration as White House communications director for such a brief tenure that the term “a Scarmucci” entered the cultural lexicon as shorthand for “a short period of time.” He spent the 2024 election season as one of Trump’s fiercest foes, largely due to the damage he believes Trump’s policies could inflict on the economy.\nScaramucci has gone on record predicting the stock market could crash during Trump’s second term. He argued that plans for mass deportations and tariffs could spike the prices of consumer goods. On an MSNBC panel before the election, he warned that Trump’s policies could “explode the deficit” and that stripping the Federal Reserve of its independence could lead to “a massacre of the local currency.”\nThat sounds dire. But wringing your hands isn’t as helpful as planning ahead. Best-case scenario, Scaramucci is wrong, and you’ve adopted some positive financial habits. If he’s right — at least you’ll be ready.\nTrending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nYou know what they say about eggs and baskets. Just as you don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket, no matter how big and beautiful it may seem, you don’t want to put all your resources in a single investment. To mitigate risk, especially when it comes to your retirement savings, it’s wise to spread out your savings across individual stocks, stock mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nConsider getting even more creative with your investments. For instance, precious metals can provide protection against market volatility. Other options include real estate, bonds, cash value life insurance, annuities, and even alternative holdings, such as oil and gas.\nIf you sense bad times on the financial horizon, having a diversified portfolio gives you the freedom to adjust. You can allocate funds to investments that seem more secure, even if only temporarily. That way, even if the worst happens, you’ll still have a safety net.\nLearn More: 3 Major Retailers Who Will Raise Prices Immediately Under Trump — Tariffs Play Key Role\nWhen difficult periods arise, it’s tempting to stick your head in the sand. Hearing about the latest downturn and economic panic can be overwhelming. But fear shouldn’t drive your financial decisions.\nThe best way to protect your investments is by being clear-eyed about what you own and why you own it. Research every stock in your portfolio and assess its value to you. When alarming headlines hit, you can resist the urge to make hasty decisions. Instead, you’ll know whether to hold onto or let go of specific assets.\nRegularly reviewing your portfolio and having level-headed conversations with a trusted financial advisor can keep your decision-making grounded. This approach helps you avoid rash and potentially damaging financial decisions.\nClearing your debt, especially high-interest debt like credit card balances, is always a smart move. It becomes even more critical during economic downturns that often follow market crashes. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by debt, it might be time to liquidate certain holdings to pay it down.\nReducing your debt before a bear market comes lumbering out of the financial woods puts you in a stronger position to weather challenging times — and to rebound once the bull market charges back into the picture.\nAccording to Anthony Scaramucci, a second Trump presidency could bring significant economic challenges, including a potential market crash.

        "title": "What Is Donald Trump's Net Worth?",
        "date": "2024-08-23T14:33:57.000Z",
        "article_content": "Current estimates of Donald Trump's wealth puts the former President's net worth at around $4.5 billion.\nHowever, Trump's net worth is a highly disputed and volatile figure. Estimates from around $2 billion to more than $ 6 billion to around $7.5 billion. Trump's net worth is extremely difficult to pin down for several reasons. Below, we’ll review these reasons as well as the assets that make up this fortune.\nConsider matching with a financial advisor to build a strategy for your net worth.\nFirst, like many very wealthy people, Trump holds much of his wealth in the form of private assets. In Trump's case, this is particularly focused on real estate and brand licensing.\nHowever it's difficult to reliably estimate the value of private assets. Without SEC reporting requirements governing them, these assets have little verified information about their underlying value. Similarly, without a high-volume public marketplace, private assets rarely have current pricing. So estimating the value of private assets involves using relatively scarce information to make a best-guess at what someone would pay for that asset if it came up for sale.\nSecond, because wealthy people tend to hold much of their wealth in private assets, much of their net worth relies on self-reporting. A wealthy person may hold assets that many people do not know about, such as art or other personal property. They also may hold assets spread across multiple jurisdictions, which cannot be readily traced by tax officials or reporters. And the details about a private company or real estate holding are, by definition, private.\nMost importantly, in the case of Trump, most of his current wealth comes from the shares he owns in the Trump Media and Technology Group ($DTJ). This company has been incredibly volatile since going public via a SPAC merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. in March, 2024. In one month alone the company has lost more than two-thirds of its value, only to double its stock price 30 days later.\nThis volatility has led to much of the seemingly-conflicting reports regarding Trump's wealth. His stake in TMTG means that Trump's wealth can fluctuate by more than $1 billion literally overnight. As a result, Trump's net worth estimates can differ wildly from month to month while also being accurate at time of writing.\nFor financial and economic news that may impact TMTG and other potential investments, sign up for the Market Minute newsletter.\nDonald Trump is a businessman and media figure best known for investing in New York City real estate. His net worth comes from a few sources in particular:\nCurrently, the significant majority of Trump's wealth comes from his ownership stake in the Trump Media and Technology Group ($DJT). This is a media company which operates the Truth Social platform. It went public in March, 2024 by merging with a publicly traded holding company called Digital World Acquisitions Corp. in a process known as a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company).\nAs of August 2024, DJT shares traded around $23 - for a market cap of about $4.5 billion - and reporting has ranged widely regarding Trump's ownership in this company. At the low end the Associated Press reported in March that he owns around 79 million shares, which would make Trump's stake in his namesake media group worth roughly $1.82 billion. At the high end, in his most recent financial disclosure Trump reported owning 114,750,000 shares in this company. If so, this would make his shares of DJT worth approximately $2.64 billion (114,750,000 * 23).\nTrump's real estate holdings are less volatile than a publicly traded equity, but far more difficult to precisely value. Through several different companies, Trump holds real estate around the world. Much, if not most of this, is in the hospitality, entertainment and residential spaces. Forbes has previously estimated the value of this portfolio at around $1 billion before debt or liabilities.\nTrump also reports holding a very wide range of diverse, commercial and nontraditional assets. It is difficult to accurately assess these holdings, as they are typically market-based and volatile. They include significant cryptocurrency investments, likely worth between $1 million and $5 million, and NFT holdings, possibly worth up to $7 million. He reports owning between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of gold bars, and many assorted publicly traded stocks, bonds and other securities.\nA financial advisor can help you build a portfolio that best suits your goals.\nFinally, Trump has significant cash holdings and current income. This is distinct from his wealth in assets, as this section of Trump's net worth represents active, defined cash flow rather than marketable assets that could be converted into cash for an uncertain value.\nThe most reliable current estimate of Trump's cash and cash-like holdings is somewhere between $300 million and $400 million. He has income from many different businesses and products, with the most significant coming from his real estate holdings. Trump has recently claimed numerous licensing agreements that generate around $2 million or $4 million apiece, as well as direct income from his properties that tends to range from $30 million to $56 million per business. All told, Trump's real estate income is estimated at around $800 million per year before costs, debt and taxes.\nBeyond those large sources of income, Trump has many small sources of income. This chiefly comes from his marketed products, often which are in the form of memorabilia, collectibles, book sales and royalties, and related products. There is no clear estimate on the value of this income, but it is likely collectively worth several million dollars per year.\nFinally, Trump has significant debts, bills and legal judgments. Setting aside the unknown or unknowable operating costs of his companies, Trump owes around $540 million in collected legal judgments against him and more than $1 billion in estimated debts against his real estate holdings. This includes about $780 million in mortgages on those assets.\nEstimating the net worth of very wealthy individuals is difficult and imprecise, as their wealth is typically held in private or volatile assets. However, the best current estimates suggest that Donald Trump is currently worth around $4.5 billion.\nNet worth isn't just for the rich, it's an issue for all of us.

        "date": "2024-11-06T11:29:56.000Z",
        "article_content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n(Reuters) - With Donald Trump heading back to the White House, Wall Street is anticipating the potential for lower taxes, deregulation and a U.S. president who is quick to sound off on everything from the stock market to the dollar.\nTrump made tariffs and tax cuts key elements of his pitch to voters, many of whom said the economy was the biggest issue of the election. Another important plank of his platform is expected to be deregulation in areas ranging from the banking industry to cryptocurrencies.\nThe promise of those policies appears to have already stirred prices for some assets, including the dollar, shares of regional banks and the price of bitcoin.\nFor a Trump administration, \"markets are basically thinking it's pro-growth, even if it comes with higher inflation and higher interest rates,\" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS Group.\nEdison Research projected on Wednesday that Trump had secured more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency.\nWhile political developments can move markets, investors say they typically tend to take a back seat to macroeconomic forces and the health of corporate profits as well as global events.\nFor example, the S&P 500 rose nearly 70% during Trump's first term as technology shares soared, even as his tariff policies sparked bouts of volatility. Meanwhile, the energy sector notched deep losses after global economies were paralyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, although his administration was friendly to fossil fuel development.\nHISTORY NOT A GUIDE?\nTrump’s election in 2016 sparked a so-called reflation trade, with investors piling into an array of assets such as copper futures and shares of construction companies on the belief that tax cuts and other stimulative policies would boost sluggish U.S. economic growth.\nBut the economic landscape has changed, and some investors believe the moves of 2016 may not offer an accurate roadmap for how stocks, bonds and the dollar might trade in coming months.\nThe U.S. economy grew by an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to just below 2% in 2016. And while months of restrictive monetary policy have helped tamp inflation down from four-decade highs hit in 2022, some investors worry tariffs or tax cuts could send consumer prices higher again. By contrast, sluggish inflation and growth were concerns for the Fed eight years ago.\nSigns of rebounding inflation could also cause a rethink of the Federal Reserve's interest rate trajectory, with the central bank just beginning to ease monetary policy after hiking rates to bring inflation down from 40-year highs.\nAnd while the last weeks of the 2024 presidential race saw betting markets move in favor of Trump over his opponent, Kamala Harris, his 2016 victory \"was a general surprise, the positive market reaction was a surprise too, and the investor positioning in the runup to elections was for a disinflationary backdrop,\" JPMorgan strategists wrote on Monday.\nTARIFFS AND TAX REFORM\nThe potential implementation of tariffs - which Trump has vowed to increase by 10% on imports, and 60% on goods from China - could make a key difference in how investors approach asset markets in coming months.\nA study by Deutsche Bank said a Trump victory would add about half a percentage point to U.S. gross domestic product if tariffs are not implemented. Tariffs would subtract about a quarter of a point from GDP, the study found.\n\"There are still going to be some question marks as to how aggressive Trump does go with tariffs, and that's going to be a story regardless of the composition of Congress, given that can be pushed through via executive action,\" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.\nTrump also wants tax reform, including reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, for those companies that make their products in the U.S., after having cut the rate to 21% from 35% during his 2017-2021 presidency.\nSuch tax cuts - which will need to pass Congress - could support company earnings and sentiment for stocks, although the extent of such a boost remains to be seen.\nCutting the rate to 15% would boost S&P 500 earnings by about 4%, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs strategists.\n\"In the shorter term, equity investors will look upon favorably a Trump victory because the potential for him\" to extend current tax cuts, said Jake Seltz, portfolio manager with Allspring Global Investments.\nAt the same time, broad tax cuts could spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt when investors are becoming increasingly focused on the federal deficit. Deficit worries have helped spark a recent selloff in U.S. government debt, taking the 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to bond prices, to 4.471% on Wednesday, its highest level since July.\nTrump's tax and spending plans would increase the debt by $7.75 trillion over the next decade, according to an Oct. 28 estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a budget-focused think-tank.\nAn added wrinkle is Trump's penchant to speak on a wide swath of potentially market-moving topics, demonstrated during his first term when he frequently commented on everything from the strength of the dollar to trade to the policies of individual companies. Those remarks occasionally sparked asset price moves.\n\"Markets are a little on edge about the idea that a Trump administration will come with a lot of communication that will be difficult to separate the noise from signal,\" said DWS Group's Bianco.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Writing by Ira Iosebashvili; Editing by Anna Driver and Catherine Evans)"

        "date": "2024-10-21T20:52:41.000Z",
        "article_content": "McDonald’s Corp. agreed to host former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania store over the weekend but said it isn’t endorsing a candidate in the U.S. presidential race.\nTrump staffed the fry station at a McDonald’s in suburban Philadelphia on Sunday before answering questions through the drive-thru window. The restaurant was closed to the public for the Republican nominee's visit.\nIn a message to employees obtained Monday by The Associated Press, McDonald's said the owner-operator of the location, Derek Giacomantonio, reached out after he learned of Trump’s desire to visit a Pennsylvania restaurant. McDonald’s agreed to the event.\n“Upon learning of the former president’s request, we approached it through the lens of one of our core values: we open our doors to everyone,” the company said. “McDonald’s does not endorse candidates for elected office and that remains true in this race for the next president. We are not red or blue – we are golden.\"\nThe Chicago burger giant said franchisees have also invited Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, to their restaurants. The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with the Harris campaign.\nMcDonald’s said it has “been a fixture of conversation this election cycle” even though it hasn’t sought that attention. At several campaign stops and during interviews, Harris has recalled working at McDonald’s for spending money during her college years. Trump has claimed – without evidence – that Harris is lying.\nMcDonald’s sidestepped that issue in its employee message. The company said it is proud of “Harris’s fond memories working under the arches” and noted the often-cited figure that 1 in 8 Americans works at McDonald’s at some point.\n“While we and our franchisees don’t have records for all positions dating back to the early ‘80s, what makes ‘1 in 8’ so powerful is the shared experience so many Americans have had,” McDonald’s said.\nTrump’s appearance led to some backlash on social media. Google searches for “boycott McDonald’s” briefly surged Monday morning, and some Twitter users vowed not to return to the chain after Trump’s event.\nChris Hydock, a marketing professor at Tulane University's Freeman School of Business, said that authorizing the visit was a risky move for McDonald's. Hydock said his research shows that when brands become associated with divisive candidates or positions, whether purposefully or not, customers who dislike those positions tend to react more strongly than those who don't dislike them.\nSmall companies can still benefit sometimes, Hydock said, since even a divisive position wins them attention and customers. But in the case of a big company like McDonald's, everyone is already aware of the company.\n“Trump working at McDonald's can’t attract more customers,” he said. “All it can end up doing is pissing some people off.”\nBut Lori Rosen, president of the public relations firm Rosen Group, said McDonald’s won’t likely see long-term damage from the event.\n“The coverage and publicity alone generated from McDonald’s agreeing to have former President Trump work at one of their franchises already surpasses the negative chatter on social media ,” Rosen said. “I am not sure if the American people will benefit from this publicity stunt. However, McDonald’s comes out ahead.”\nBruce Newman, a professor in business ethics and marketing at DePaul University’s Driehaus College of Business, agrees.\n“They look like the company that’s getting the attention of the presidential candidates, and it heightens the awareness of the brand,” he said.\nNewman added that Trump was likely trying to put a different, more casual face on his campaign, wearing a smile and an apron instead of a suit jacket."

        "article_content": "-Shares of former U.S. President Donald Trump's media company tumbled 10% to a new low on Monday, extending recent losses after restrictions on insider selling expired.\nSix straight sessions of declines in Trump Media & Technology Group , which is 57% owned by the Republican presidential candidate, have left its market capitalization at $2.4 billion.\nShares of the company, which operates the Truth Social app, ended the day at $12.15, their lowest close since Trump Media's stock-market debut in March.\nThe stock has now declined 17% since restrictions on insider selling lifted on Thursday.\nTrump Media saw its value balloon to nearly $10 billion following its Wall Street debut, lifted by Trump supporters and retail traders who saw it as a speculative bet on his chances of securing a second four-year term as president.\nSince then, Trump Media shares have steadily lost ground, with share declines accelerating after President Joe Biden gave up his failing reelection bid on July 21.\nLosses in the stock in recent months have far outpaced a reduction in betting-market odds that Trump would win the election.\nTrump leads among likely voters in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, outpacing U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, a New York Times/Siena College poll showed on Monday, echoing other recent polls showing a tight matchup ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.\nIn an interview on Sunday, Trump said he would not make a fourth consecutive run for the U.S. presidency if he loses the Nov. 5 election.\nAs of Monday, PredictIt contracts for a Trump election victory were trading at 46 cents, with a potential payout of $1. Trump contracts peaked at 69 cents in mid-July. Contracts for a Harris victory were at 57 cents, little changed over the past two weeks.\nTrump, whose stake in Trump Media is now worth roughly $1.4 billion, said on Sept. 13 he did not plan to sell his shares, turning the focus to other major stakeholders who could cash out.\nUnited Atlantic Ventures and Patrick Orlando, whose fund ARC Global Investments II sponsored the blank-check company that merged with Trump Media in March, together own about 11% of Trump Media shares, according to a company filing.\n(Reporting by Noel RandewichEditing by Tomasz Janowski and Chizu Nomiyama)"

Trump also said he plans to meet with the billionaire founder of Amazon.com Inc. Jeff Bezos next week.\nNeither representatives for Trump nor Apple immediately responded to requests for comment.\nTrump’s policies and rhetoric may clash with Apple’s public positions, but the company has had an antagonistic relationship with President Joe Biden’s administration. Apple was sued by the Justice Department in an antitrust case that might drag on for years, and mounting regulatory scrutiny around the world is threatening its operations.\nCook had a warm relationship with Trump during his first term, largely fending off tariff threats after successfully selling him on the idea that additional duties on iPhones would actually benefit a South Korean rival, Samsung Electronics Co.\nTrump for his second term is again vowing to impose sweeping new tariffs, including a 10-20% across-the-board tariffs on all foreign goods and levies as high as 60% on Chinese products. The vast majority of Apple’s iPhones are made in China, even as the company has sought to shift manufacturing to other locations in recent years.\nThe Apple CEO was quick to congratulate Trump shortly after his November election win, posting on social media, “We look forward to engaging with you and your administration to help make sure the United States continues to lead with and be fueled by ingenuity, innovation and creativity.”\nTrump has criticized Apple in the past for resisting requests from law enforcement to build a backdoor into its phone operating system that would allow authorities to access data without a user’s password. On the campaign trail, Trump called on Apple to assist federal investigators in breaking into the phones of two men accused of plotting assassination attempts on his life.\nNeither Cook nor Apple, which doesn’t have a political action committee, donated at the federal level in the 2024 election cycle, Federal Election Commission records show.

        "article_content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is encountering a significant challenge with the U.S. dollar. Despite his inclination towards a “weaker” currency to enhance U.S. exports and reduce the trade deficit, his proposed policies might inadvertently lead to a stronger dollar.\nWhat Happened: According to Chatham House, David Lubin, a senior research fellow, noted that while Trump prefers a weaker exchange rate, the market expects his policies to result in “strengthening the greenback.”\n“President-elect Donald Trump has a dollar problem,” Lubin noted.\nDon’t Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.\n“The risk is that the U.S. dollar – which is expensive already – becomes more obviously overvalued, and this could increase the risk of global financial instability.”\nThe dollar’s value has seen fluctuations over the years, with a significant weakening from 2002 to 2011, followed by a strengthening. Factors such as the eurozone crisis and a slowing Chinese economy have shifted economic vitality back to the U.S., further boosting the dollar.\nTrump’s proposed tariffs and fiscal policies, including extending tax cuts, could also contribute to a stronger dollar. These measures may create inflationary pressures, leading to higher interest rates and a tighter monetary policy, which typically results in a stronger currency.\nSee Also: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nThe implications of a stronger dollar include potential challenges for global trade and financial markets, especially for developing countries with weakening currencies.\nWhy It Matters: The potential strengthening of the dollar under Trump’s administration could have far-reaching consequences. Semiconductor giants like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics have been investing billions in the U.S. following the Chips and Science Act. However, Trump’s return could prompt a reevaluation of these investments.\nMoreover, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that Trump’s proposed tariffs could undermine financial market confidence and raise household costs, potentially destabilizing the economy. Yellen emphasized that while targeted tariffs can address unfair trade practices, broad measures might harm U.S. economic competitiveness.\nAdditionally, Paul Gambles from MBMG Family Office Group criticized Trump’s tariff policies as “completely and utterly wrong,” suggesting they could harm the U.S.’s competitive advantage. Despite these concerns, Gambles believes the tariffs may not be implemented to the extent Trump suggests.\nCheck It Out: \nReal estate is a great way to diversify your portfolio and earn high returns, but it can also be a big hassle. Luckily, there are other ways to tap into the power of real estate without owning property. Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100. \nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

        "article_content": "Donald Trump traveled to Silicon Valley Thursday night and raised a reported $12 million from tech executives, a notable foray into a longtime Democratic stronghold.\nThe event, co-hosted by billionaire investor David O. Sacks and venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, capped a wave of new Trump inroads with wealthy donors from the worlds of tech, crypto, and Wall Street.\n\"The Blue Wall of Tech has been breached,\" Messari CEO Ryan Selkis posted after attending the event.\nSelkis, who co-founded his crypto market intelligence firm, was among those who reportedly paid between $50,000 and $500,000 for tickets to attend the event at Sacks's home.\n\"Electric event!\" Selkis added alongside a picture of himself with the former president.\nHarmeet Dhillon, the former vice chairwoman of the California Republican Party, posted pictures of the event and said the fundraiser had met expectations by raising $12 million because of the support from tech.\nIndeed, the presence of crypto leaders — after three years of tense relations between Biden and the sector — was notable. The New York Times reported that both Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss were in attendance and earned a shoutout from Trump.\nBiden has his own supporters in Silicon Valley. During a recent stop in the Bay Area, the president raised money at an event co-hosted by Marissa Mayer, the former CEO of Yahoo.\nAnother stop, according to pool reports, was at the home of Jon Shirley, the former president of Microsoft (MSFT).\nThe main organizer of this week's event, Sacks, also posted an essay Thursday night formally endorsing Trump and reiterated his reasons for getting behind the former president, charging Biden with failing on the economy and allowing politicized prosecutions.\nHe said voters would be able to compare Trump and Biden’s time in office side by side, adding: \"In tech, we call this an A/B test.\"\nSacks is a close political ally of Sen. J.D. Vance, a Republican of Ohio, who once worked in Silicon Valley and now has emerged as a crucial conduit between Trump's campaign and these big-time donors.\nOther billionaires who were not in attendance Thursday night but have been expressing more and more openness to Trump reposted the essay from Sacks in positive terms.\n\"Thoughtful,\" said Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.\nPershing Square CEO Bill Ackman added that he agreed with \"most but not all\" of Sacks's reasons for supporting Trump.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Trump Media stock is surging over the past month, shooting up 198%.\nThe recent catapult comes after the stock tumbled to an all-time low of $12.15 on Sept. 23. The stock is now trading at $36.30 a share.\nTrump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is the holding company that owns Truth Social, the upstart social media platform that former President Donald Trump founded when he was kicked off mainstream sites in the wake of the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and his refusal to accept that he lost the 2020 presidential election. The stock trades on Nasdaq under the symbol DJT, reflecting Donald John Trump’s initials.\nDespite its recent rally, TMTG’s financial performance has been lackluster. In the first half of this year, the company reported losses of $344 million on revenues of $1.6 million. However, over the last few weeks the stock's momentum could have attracted interest from momentum-based investors, eager to cash in on its growth.\n“The extremely high volume of trading relative to the public float suggests that there are many traders, both individuals and institutions, following short-term momentum strategies,” said University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. “These traders contribute to volatility, in that when the tide turns, many of them move in the same direction. A drop in the stock price leads others to sell, driving the stock down. When the stock rises, they buy, driving the price higher.”\nThere are a bevy of colorful names for short-term momentum investors. So-called sharks trade aggressively in search of fast profits; piranhas describe shivers of such traders. Cheetahs are high-frequency traders, and those on the bandwagon follow trades after they start.\nOctober trading volumes for TMTG have been astronomical, with hundreds of millions of shares changing hands. Last week more than 278 million shares were traded on the market, according to Bloomberg data. The week before, 194 million shares were traded.\nNonetheless, it is impossible to divorce TMTG’s stock surge from Trump’s political fortunes. The stock often trades independently of fundamentals related to its business operations.\n“The surge in DJT corresponds to the increase in the polling numbers for Donald Trump winning the presidential election,” Ritter said.\nIn recent weeks, election polls show the narrow lead Vice President Kamala Harris had over Trump slipping. The race now appears virtually tied, with Trump having a slight edge in certain forecasts. On Monday, The Economist announced its election forecast had Trump with a 54% chance of winning the race. Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight, said that while the race is a 50/50 toss up, he sees Trump winning.\nTMTG has been likened to a meme stock, meaning it trades on reasons that have nothing to do with business and financial metrics. Instead it often functions as a means for people to demonstrate their political support for Trump.\nIn an SEC filing from June, TMTG estimated it had about 620,000 shareholders, “the vast majority of whom are everyday retail investors.” The influence of certain committed investors, many of whom are Trump superfans, doesn't always reflect the true health of the company because they’re often operating in echo chambers, according to George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, an online trading platform. \n“They surround themselves with Trumpers, boot people from online communities that fail the purity tests,” Kailas said. “Then they hold the belief that he couldn’t possibly lose because they think most everyone agrees with them.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Donald Trump was threatening to send Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to prison “for life” if he interfered in the election just a few short months ago—but come Thanksgiving, the bad blood appears to be water under the bridge.\nIn fact, the president-elect and the Big Tech entrepreneur enjoyed a pre-Thanksgiving dinner in Florida this week.\nThe meeting between the pair on Wednesday night was first reported by the New York Times but has since been confirmed by Meta.\nThe duo and their teams sat down at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, with Meta telling the NYT: “It’s an important time for the future of American innovation.\n“Mark was grateful for the invitation to join President Trump for dinner and the opportunity to meet with members of his team about the incoming administration.”\nMeta did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nOf course, Zuckerberg isn’t the only billionaire guest being welcomed at Mar-a-Lago; Tesla CEO Elon Musk is becoming something of a regular.\nMusk and Trump’s relationship has become increasingly close since the former endorsed the latter in the presidential election and plowed hundreds of millions of dollars into his campaign.\nIn turn, the Republican politician has U-turned his rhetoric on electric vehicles and created a Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, will be heading up.\nOn the other hand, the relationship between Trump and Zuckerberg has been considerably less cozy.\nIn August—and in print, no less—Trump threatened Zuckerberg with lifetime incarceration if he was perceived to interfere in the 2024 election.\nIn his book Save America, Trump wrote Zuckerberg “would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.”\nThe mention of “Lock Boxes” appears to refer to a $420 million donation Zuckerberg’s charity made to fund election infrastructure in 2020.\nAt the time, critics—including then-President Trump—baselessly claimed the funds were being used to get then–Democratic nominee Joe Biden elected.\nIndeed, a UCLA study published in May discovered that the billionaire’s funds—nicknamed “Zuckerbucks” by critics—“did not substantially improve the performance of Democratic candidates.”\nIn August, Zuckerberg offered further clarification.\nIn an open letter penned to Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, Zuckerberg said the contributions were designed to be nonpartisan and were spread across a range of urban and rural communities.\n“We are watching him closely,” Trump added in the book, “and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison—as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.”\nTrump had previously made a similar statement in July.\nWriting on his social media platform, Truth Social, the Republican candidate said: “All I can say is that if I’m elected President, we will pursue Election Fraudsters at levels never seen before, and they will be sent to prison for long periods of time. We already know who you are. DON’T DO IT! ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!”\nThe Meta founder, worth $202 billion, kept his cards close to his chest this election cycle, endorsing neither Trump nor Harris.\nHe did, however, praise Trump’s response to an assassination attempt at one of his rallies in July.\nZuckerberg told Bloomberg’s Emily Chang later that month: “At some level as an American, it’s hard to not, like, get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight. And I think that’s why a lot of people like the guy.”\nThe entrepreneur later congratulated the president-elect on his successful campaign to win the White House, writing on his app Threads: “Congratulations to President Trump on a decisive victory. We have great opportunities ahead of us as a country. Looking forward to working with you and your administration.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

A series of media exposés, civil and criminal trials, and other investigations has revealed Trump to be a fraudster who has repeatedly pushed the boundaries of legality in his business career and is now paying the price.\nThe latest and biggest bombshell is the May 30 conviction of Trump by a New York jury on 34 counts related to falsifying business records as part of the Stormy Daniels saga that goes all the way back to 2006.\nTrump's alleged affair with Daniels occurred at a celebrity golf tournament in California while he was married to his current wife Melania Trump. Daniels threatened to go public with the story when Trump ran for president 10 years later, in 2016. So Trump and some aides paid her $130,000 to keep quiet, which she did. The story only became public in 2018 as a result of dogged reporting by the Wall Street Journal.\nTrump’s fling with Daniels wasn’t illegal. Nor was the “hush money” payment buying her silence. That’s not what the New York City district attorney charged Trump for.\nThe DA charged Trump with falsifying business records because he disguised the payments as legal disbursements on his company’s books. Trump’s lawyer at the time, Michael Cohen, made the $130,000 payment to Daniels out of his own funds in 2016, and Trump paid him back, with additions that added up to $420,000. Cohen got the payments through a series of checks Trump signed in 2017. Those checks accounted for 34 different accounting entries, which is why there were 34 charges. The jury found Trump guilty of a felony in every instance.\nMost Americans haven’t been closely following the NYC trial, and some may wonder what all the hoopla is about since there’s nothing new about the Daniels affair. What is new, however, is the growing body of evidence about Trump’s fraudulent habits and the tarnish it adds to his reputation as a businessman.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nLast year, the New York state attorney general prevailed in a civil lawsuit charging Trump with overvaluing many of the properties in his portfolio, some by as much as 400%. The overvalued assets included his Trump Tower residence, a Wall Street office building, a Bedford, N.Y., estate, three golf clubs, his Mar-a-Lago club, a partnership deal with the developer Vornado, and other properties. The bogus valuations helped Trump get sweetheart deals on bank loans and insurance policies, plus it allowed him to claim a higher net worth in the billionaire surveys he takes so seriously.\nWhen determining the penalty Trump should pay, Judge Arthur Engoron wrote, “This is not the first time the Trump Organization or its related entities have been found to have engaged in corporate malfeasance. This court finds that defendants are likely to continue their fraudulent ways unless the court grants significant injunctive relief.” Engoron imposed a massive $464 million fine and appointed an independent trustee to monitor Trump’s company.\nThere’s more. In 2022, the Trump Organization’s former CFO, Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty to 15 criminal counts of tax fraud related to his work for the company. In the same case, the company was convicted on 17 counts of tax fraud.\nIn 2018, the New York attorney general sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation for “persistent violations of the law,” with a settlement the following year dissolving the foundation. In 2013, the New York attorney general sued the entity known as “Trump University” for fraud, with the outcome including the closure of the operation and $25 million in payments to litigants who brought a class-action suit.\nTrump, of course, maintains his innocence, and he has appealed the civil finding calling for $464 million in penalties. He seems certain to appeal the guilty verdicts in the New York City case.\nAt the same time, Trump has tried to turn his legal troubles to his advantage, portraying himself as a victim of political persecution and even selling copies of the mug shot taken at the beginning of the trial. Donations have rained in to his campaign following every legal reversal, suggesting sympathy for Trump’s plight among some Americans.\nAt the same time, the unfiltered look Trump’s trials provide into the inner workings of his business show him to be a petty cheat and, we can finally say without the descriptor “alleged,” a crook. Trump plainly got ahead by cheating, which blows up all the claims of business genius he has made in his books, his interviews, and his windy campaign speeches.\nNobody knows how the Trump criminal conviction, the first ever for a former president or a major presidential candidate, will affect this year’s election. In a normal world, it would disqualify Trump, but he may still have a plausible chance of beating the incumbent President Joe Biden. Voters may yet decide they don’t mind being led by a cheater, a convict, and a business bumbler.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story was edited to reflect that Donald Trump’s alleged affair with Stormy Daniels has not been confirmed.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump plans to make America a leader in the cryptocurrency space, through investments and “sensible” regulations.\nEric Trump said his father “realizes that every country in the world is embracing crypto, noting that both he and the president elect have been “a big fan of crypto for a long time,” in an interview with CNBC (CMCSA) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n“He wants to make America the crypto capital of the world,” Trump said of his father. “He’s been very, very clear with that.”\nTrump said America risks being “left behind” if it doesn’t begin ramping up its investments into digital assets. He pointed to the UAE as an example of a country that has embraced crypto and enacted regulations that have helped spur innovation and investments into the growing sector.\n“America better lead the way, otherwise we’re going to leave a lot behind,” he said.\nThe former and incoming president’s embrace of crypto was a major cornerstone of his presidential campaign, pitching himself as the “crypto candidate” and “crypto president” while courting tech leaders.\nHe has called for a strategic national Bitcoin reserve, declared all Bitcoin should be mined in the U.S., and attached his name to multiple crypto projects this year.\nWhen it comes to regulation — or deregulation — Trump said that he expects the president-elect to establish clear guidelines and “sensible regulation” that sets the rules of the road for the industry.\n“It looks like it’s transparent. That’s what it is,” he said.\n“A lot of people think that the crypto industry doesn’t want regulation,” he continued. “That’s actually not true. They just want sensible regulation, regulation that they can follow, regulation that’s crystal clear, that’s black and white.”\nTrump also said the industry doesn’t “want to see people like Gary Gensler, who was absolutely a disaster for crypto.” He accused the Securities and Exchange Commission chair of doing “everything he could to stifle innovation.”\nGensler said he will be leaving his role on Jan. 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration — a welcome move for the crypto industry, which has crusaded against the SEC official for the agency’s strict oversight of the industry. Under his guidance, the SEC took on high-profile cases against a number of major industry players, such as Coinbase and Binance.\nPresident-elect Trump has tapped Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency advocate, to chair the regulator. Atkins, who now leads the consulting firm Patomak Global Partners, has chaired The Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017, which was charged with advocating best practices and recommending legal frameworks that promote the crypto industry.\n— William Gavin contributed to this article.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

Though as reported by Venable, Trump did not mention the minimum wage during the 2024 election cycle.\nSo it remains to be seen what could happen to the minimum wage during his administration.\nCheck Out: Here’s What the US Minimum Wage Was the Year You Were Born\nTrump also aims to revitalize the manufacturing industry. Per NPR, Trump has declared that he would work to remove “regulatory burdens” that keep manufacturing companies from building new factories more quickly. He also stated plans to encourage factories to move from other countries to the U.S. through tax breaks and access to land, per The New York Times.\nElsewhere, he assured working-class voters that he plans to bring back manufacturing jobs by imposing tariffs on imported goods and by lessening the corporate tax rate that domestic manufacturers are required to pay.\nDuring his previous presidential administration, Trump refused to uphold an Obama-era rule that allowed for greater eligibility and access to overtime pay for American workers. Further, at campaign events throughout 2024, Trump noted that he himself as a private-sector employer “hated paying overtime” and preferred to hire more employees than pay overtime.\nHowever, Trump has also stated plans to make overtime exempt from income taxes. Per the Tax Foundation, Trump proposed “a blanket exemption” for overtime income in early September.\nNPR noted that Trump “gutted” federal employee unions during his previous administration and instead supported right-to-work laws. These laws can reduce the strength of unions, as they don’t require union workers to pay dues. Though advocates of right-to-work laws say they allow greater choice among employees.\nTrump also complimented SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, calling him “the greatest cutter” for firing any employee who went on strike.\nIf his new administration is anything like his last, it’s unlikely his presidency will be any more supportive of unions. According to Pew Research Center data, only 26% of union members said that Trump’s policies would be positive for union members, while 46% said they would make things worse.\nHowever, Trump received support from some union workers during the election, and that “strong support” may pressure him to protect union members in some way, Anthony Miyazaki, a marketing professor at Florida International University, told Reuters.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "(Bloomberg) -- President-elect Donald Trump transfered about $4 billion worth of shares in his media company to a trust that is controlled by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nReviving a Little-Known Modernist Landmark in Buffalo\nThe Architects Who Built Miami\nNew York’s Congestion Pricing Plan Still Faces Legal Hurdles\nNew York City’s Historic Preservation Movement Is Having a Midlife Crisis\nMexico City to Boost Mobility, Security Ahead of FIFA World Cup\nThe soon-to-be president, who was the largest Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. shareholder with nearly 115 million shares, will now directly own zero shares and be the trust’s sole beneficiary, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAccording to a separate filing on Thursday evening, Donald Trump Jr. “has sole voting and investment power over all securities owned by the Trust.”\nThe move is similar to the approach Trump took in his first term on the conflicts of interest that his sprawling real estate empire posed. Instead of divesting his assets, Trump put them into a trust managed by his two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Allen Weisselberg, a longtime executive of his business.\nCritics, including Walter Shaub, then the director of the Office of Government Ethics, argued the arrangement didn’t eliminate his potential conflicts. They said Trump was still aware of which assets were held by the trust, those running it weren’t independent, and his companies continued to do business, benefiting him financially.\nUnlike other high ranking members of the executive branch, including cabinet secretaries and White House officials, US presidents aren’t required under federal law to divest assets, even if they pose a conflict of interest. Since the passage of the Ethics in Government Act in 1978, the post-Watergate reform measure that aims to eliminate conflicts, all other presidents voluntarily abided by it.\nIn the weeks prior to his reelection, Trump said he wouldn’t sell any shares in the media company, which trades under his initials and went public in March through a blank-check merger.\nThe stock has been volatile since its debut as investors ignored its fundamentals. Shares in the company traded 4.6% lower on Friday.\nShares, which had been in decline, started to rebound during the last leg of the US presidential election.

        "article_content": "The post-election stock market rally that has been dubbed the “Trump trade” has the potential to extend well into next year, according to some market watchers.\nBeyond the initial market pop driven by investors interpreting the election of Republican Donald Trump as bullish for markets, Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research at CFRA, anticipates a more business-friendly environment under Trump.\n“This is generally bullish for ETFs,” Ullal said. “One of the factors driving the initial rally is the expectation of less regulations around financials and energy, but there are also expectations that the strength of the stock market could broaden into small- and mid-cap stocks.”\nJay Hatfield, chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital in New York City, also sees a Trump presidency as bullish for smaller U.S. companies.\n“This is definitely bullish for small caps, but it is really more about specific sectors than market capitalization,” he said.\nHatfield noted that it is a common misconception that smaller companies in general are more leveraged and therefore more interest rate-sensitive.\n“Smaller companies are de facto interest rate sensitive because the sectors of the index tend to be lower in technology and higher in financials and real estate and other companies that do better when we’re not in Fed tightening cycle,” he said. “But right now, we’re in a Fed loosening cycle, and we’re more optimistic about rates than the market because we think most of Trump’s policies are disinflationary.”\nOne of the shifts Hatfield expects under Trump is a Federal Trade Commission that will encourage consolidation.\n“The most important thing to think about is that small companies are acquisition targets, but the FTC has been putting a lid on consolidation,” Hatfield said.\nThen, there is the potential for a reduced corporate tax rate, down to 15% from the current 21%.\n“There will be a new tax bill, and a corporate tax reduction will be in that bill,” said Hatfield, who expects the S&P 500 Index to gain 25% next year.\n“And we think small caps will beat that 25%,” he added.\nUllal said the initial rally of financial sector stocks following last week’s election was in response to a more relaxed regulatory environment, considering the Republican track record of being “less hawkish on antitrust action.”\nAnother factor supporting small-cap stocks is the valuation levels of large-cap stocks, illustrated by the S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.3, compared to a historical average of 16.\nSmall- and mid-cap stocks, meanwhile, have forward p/es of around 17, which is in line with their historical averages.\n“Large caps are already richly valued,” Ullal said. “That can continue for some time, but at some point, we may hit a ceiling.”\n\nPermalink | © Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "article_content": "Donald Trump surprised the world by winning the US presidential election in 2016, establishing a mystique as somebody who can break rules, violate norms, take crazy risks, and still win.\nThe mystique is gone.\nSince 2018, Trump has endured a string of losses that should bury the idea that Trump somehow defies gravity in politics and business. The latest smackdown is his conviction in a New York City criminal trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to the notorious Stormy Daniels hush money payment right before the 2016 election. A jury found that a series of checks Trump signed to cover the payment were falsely labeled as legal expenses on his company's books, amounting to criminal felonies.\nTrump could face jail time if his appeal fails to overturn the verdict, but it seems more likely he'll get off with probation. But jail time is still a possibility in three other criminal trials where Trump faces more than 50 additional criminal charges. He also faces astronomical legal bills.\nTrump will get a much-needed win in July, when the Republican Party is due to make him their official candidate in the 2024 presidential race. But his mounting record as a serial loser should worry supporters. Here are seven other prominent examples:\nThe 2018 midterm elections. Voter disgust with Trump in the second year of his presidency helped Democrats flip 40 seats and recapture the House of Representatives from Trump’s Republican party. While it’s normal for the president’s party to lose ground in the midterms, exit polls in 2018 revealed unusually high levels of opposition to Trump, which fueled record turnout. Control of the House allowed Democrats to block Trump’s legislative agenda for the last two years of his presidency.\nThe 2020 presidential election. Trump was the first incumbent to lose a reelection bid since George H. W. Bush in 1992.\nThe 2020 Senate race. Control of the Senate in the 2020 election came down to two runoff races in Georgia that weren’t concluded until early January 2021. Two Democratic challengers ended up beating two incumbent Republicans, an improbable Hollywood ending for Democrats that gave them a one-vote majority and control of both houses of Congress. Many analysts, including Republicans, blamed Trump’s election denialism and his squabbling with fellow Republicans for the Georgia Senate losses. Those two Senate seats allowed Democrats to pass a huge stimulus bill in 2021 and a massive set of green energy incentives in 2022 that never would have happened had Republicans kept control of the Senate.\nThe 2022 midterms. Trump endorsed a variety of Republicans in 2022, including many incumbents with no chance of losing. In competitive races, however, most of Trump’s choices lost, including Senate candidates Herschel Walker in Georgia, Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, and Blake Masters in Arizona, allowing Democrats to keep the Senate. Republicans did win control of the House, but just barely, with Democrats overperforming. Once again, exit polls showed that Trump’s involvement hurt Republicans.\nTrump Organization fraud case. In December 2022, a New York jury convicted Trump’s real estate company on 17 charges of tax fraud and other crimes. That’s the same case in which former CFO Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to tax crimes. A judge fined the company $1.6 million, the maximum allowed. Prosecutors didn’t charge Trump personally.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nE. Jean Carroll lawsuits. Last year, a federal jury found that Trump sexually abused and defamed the New York writer, ordering him to pay her $5 million. Trump continued to lambaste Carroll publicly, and in January, another jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll an additional $83.3 million. Trump has continued to bash Carroll, raising the possibility she could come back for even more.\nNew York state fraud lawsuit. Last September, a judge found that Trump, his company, and several executives defrauded banks and insurance companies by substantially and repeatedly overstating the value of certain properties. On Feb. 17, the same judge hit Trump with $355 million in fines, plus interest that pushed the total over $450 million.\nTrump famously said in 2016 that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue in New York and suffer no consequences. He and his supporters should reassess. During the last few years, Trump has repeatedly suffered consequences for cheating, bullying, lying, and overestimating his capabilities. The stakes are about to get higher still.\nComing up next are one federal trial on Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the US Capitol and another on his misuse of classified documents after he left the White House. Then there’s the Fulton County, Ga., trial on election fraud. Those probably won't get started until after this year's election, and Trump could withdraw the two federal cases if he becomes president again.\nTrump seems to win points with his supporters for mouthing off to judges and prosecutors and proclaiming himself a political martyr, but he’s losing cases on the facts and elections on poor politicking. Some analysts speculate that Trump's legal catastrophes may force him to declare personal bankruptcy.\nAs for the 2024 election, Trump is defying the odds again by being the only presidential candidate of a major political party to be a convicted felon. But Trump is no longer the establishment wrecker he claimed to be in 2016. The establishment he wants to destroy is fighting back, and racking up a sizable string of victories.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "He's sold Bibles, sneakers, photo books and cryptocurrency during his third campaign for president. Now, Donald Trump is launching a new business venture: diamond-encrusted watches.\nThe Republican presidential candidate unveiled the “Official Trump Watch Collection” on Thursday. The most expensive, listed as including 122 diamonds on its bezel and available in three 18-karat gold styles, costs $100,000. Another “Fight Fight Fight” model is listed at $499.\nTrump has hawked a series of branded products since he launched his 2024 White House campaign, following his long tradition of melding his political and business interests. Thursday's launch, coming 40 days before Election Day, could open him up to criticism about monetizing his campaign, particularly as he makes an argument that Vice President Kamala Harris is out of touch with Americans' economic struggles.\nWhile websites for the various products note that proceeds from their sales do not directly benefit Trump or his campaign, they also note that each is subject to a “paid license agreement.” That’s the same mechanism that allowed Trump, well before he entered politics, to profit for years from sales of everything from water, vodka and steaks.\nEarlier this week, he announced the sale of $100 silver coins bearing his face. In March, ahead of Easter, Trump released a video on Truth Social urging his supporters to spend $59.99 for a “God Bless the USA Bible,” inspired by country singer Lee Greenwood’s patriotic ballad. Trump takes the stage to the song at each of his rallies and has appeared with Greenwood at events.\nIn February, he hawked new Trump-branded sneakers at “Sneaker Con,” a gathering that bills itself as the “The Greatest Sneaker Show on Earth.” The shoes, shiny gold high tops with an American flag detail on the back, are being sold as “Never Surrender High-Tops” for $399 on a new website that also sells other Trump-branded shoes and “Victory47” cologne and perfume for $99 a bottle.\nTrump has also dabbled in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and last year reported earning between $100,000 and $1 million from a series of digital trading cards that portrayed him in cartoon-like images, including as an astronaut, a cowboy and a superhero.\nSome of those items, including the coins, sneakers and Bibles, were listed as affiliated with CIC Ventures LLC, a company that Trump reported owning in his 2023 financial disclosure, has a similar arrangement with 45Footwear, which also says it uses Trump’s “name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.”\nThe items have gone up for sale in the wake of a $489 million civil fraud judgment against the former president, which a New York appellate court on Thursday appeared to be open to reducing or reversing.\nAccording to a disclaimer on a sales website, the watches are covered by a similar agreement to license Trump’s name, image and likeness, and proceeds from their sales do not go to Trump’s campaign or the Trump Organization and “are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.”\nInstead, TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC — the company listed as the sales entity — says it uses the “‘Trump’ name, image and likeness under a paid license agreement which may be terminated or revoked according to its terms. Trump Watches are intended as collectible items for individual enjoyment only, not for investment purposes.”\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign referred questions about the licensing deal to the Trump Organization, which did not immediately return a message seeking comment. TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC also did not immediately respond to an inquiry on the deal via its website.\n___\nMeg Kinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina, and can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP"

        "article_content": "Donald Trump and his top allies quickly jumped on a hotter-than-expected inflation report Thursday to slam the Biden-Harris administration, the Federal Reserve, and central bank chairman Jerome Powell.\n\"The fact is that the Federal Reserve brought the interest rates down a little too quickly,\" former President Donald Trump said Thursday afternoon during an appearance at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\"It was too big a cut and everyone knows that was a political maneuver that they tried to do before the election,\" he added.\nIt was the most direct critique from Trump of Powell in months and came after an initial reaction from the GOP nominee to the September interest rate cut of 50 basis points in which Trump often focused on charges of a bad economy over critiquing the central bank directly.\n“It was totally a political decision and inflation has started to rise,” Trump said Thursday while also charging that high interest rates \"really kills the American dream for young people.\"\nMake America Great Again, Inc. — a Trump-supporting Super-PAC — also jumped in with a release Thursday saying Thursday's inflation reading could be part of \"the Fed's worst nightmare.\"\nOverall, prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, increased 2.4% over the last year, which marked a slight deceleration following August's 2.5% annual gain in prices.\nRead more: Jobs, inflation, and the Fed: How they're all related\nBut the lower annual readings were largely overshadowed by a monthly increase in September of 0.2% over August, hotter than economist estimates of a 0.1% uptick.\nDemocrats, including the Biden-Harris administration, chose to focus on that annual number in their reactions, with national economic adviser Lael Brainard offering in a statement that \"inflation has fallen back down to 2.4%, the same rate as right before the pandemic.\"\n\"We keep making progress,\" she added.\nThe Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee won’t gather again until after Election Day. Thursday's inflation reading appeared to offer new momentum for central bank hawks counseling a more gradual pace of interest rate cuts in the months ahead.\nAnd some initial reactions suggested a change in strategy is not likely no matter what Trump says.\nLikely 25 basis point cuts at the last two meetings of the year are \"pretty much baked into the cake,\" Max Kettner, HSBC chief multi-asset strategist, offered in a Yahoo Finance video interview Thursday.\nBut Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic did tell The Wall Street Journal Thursday following the CPI release that he was “totally comfortable” with holding steady next month and that he had already penciled in an estimate of just one more rate cut this year.\nWhat Thursday's campaign trail commentary could do is mark a return to political headaches for Powell that have ebbed and flowed over the course of 2024.\nIn August, Trump said he would like a \"say\" in setting interest rates, raising the prospect that the Republican nominee could seek to reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve if he wins in November.\nHe was even blunter earlier in the year when he told Bloomberg in June that cuts are something \"they know they shouldn't be doing.\" That came after a February Fox Business interview in which Trump said of cuts: \"I think [Powell's] going to do something to probably help the Democrats.\"\nRead more: How much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates?\nBut when a cut finally came, Trump's initial reaction was to focus on the economy.\n\"I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much, assuming that they are not just playing politics,\" Trump said in September a few hours after the cut.\n\"It was a political move,\" he offered a few days later in a Newsmax interview but only at the urging of the interviewer and after Trump had first mentioned the economy.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

(AP) — Donald Trump hosted Apple CEO Tim Cook for a Friday evening dinner at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly.\nCook is the latest in a string of big tech leaders — including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos — who have sought to improve their standing with the incoming president after choppy relations with Trump during his first term.\nTrump has said he has spoken with Cook about the company's long-running tax battles with the European Union. \nThe meeting comes less than two months after Trump said he spoke to Cook by phone, and soon after Apple lost its last appeal in a dispute with the EU over 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland.\n“He said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion,\" Trump recalled of his conversation with Cook, in an October interview with podcaster Patrick Bet-David. \"Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion.\"\nThe decision by the EU top court was the finale to a dispute that centered on sweetheart deals that Dublin was offering to attract multinational businesses with minimal taxes across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission in 2016 ruled that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid that Ireland was required to recover.\nTrump's transition team and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his dinner with Cook.\nOpenAI CEO Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump’s inauguration fund, the company confirmed Friday. Amazon and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, confirmed this week they had each donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund.\nDuring his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump’s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump’s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.\nMore recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, he said at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York that he was “optimistic” about Trump’s second term while also endorsing president-elect’s plans to cut regulations.\nThe donation from Meta came just weeks after Meta CEO Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago.\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump’s response to his first assassination attempt."

        "article_content": "Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5. In 2020, news organizations were confident enough to call the race for Joe Biden on Election Day night, which is the usual outcome. The only modern exception was the 2000 election, which hinged on a recount in Florida and took more than a month to decide.\nThe 2024 election could entail another delayed outcome — and this year, traders are getting in on the action.\nDonald Trump’s new company, Trump Technology and Media Group (DJT), has become a sort of proxy bet on whether Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, will win or lose. If Trump wins, his company, known by its ticker symbol DJT, could become a hub of info for the new president and everybody in his orbit through the Truth Social media app. If Trump loses, by contrast, Truth Social, an also-ran behind goliaths such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X, will end up as a rump single-purpose Trump megaphone with little value.\nFor the last several months, the buying and selling of DJT shares has been a key “Trump trade” — a bet on whether Trump or his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, will win the 2024 election. Investors now seem to be betting on the timing of the election outcome through option contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell the stock in the future at a certain price. Options expire, typically on Fridays, so an investor buying an option is placing a timed bet. If investors were betting on DJT surging or crashing right after Election Day, they’d be piling into option contracts that expire Nov. 8, three days later.\nBut they’re not. The heaviest action by far is in DJT option contracts that expire Nov. 15, 10 days after Election Day. The amount of “open interest,” or number of contracts traded, is nearly eight times higher for the Nov. 15 vintage than for Nov. 8. After Nov. 15, the open interest plunges.\n“People think we’re not going to know the election results on Election Day, or even on Nov. 8,” said Eric Hale, founder and CEO of Trader Oasis. “Traders betting on the election are betting on a Nov. 15 outcome.”\nIt’s plausible. Most of the seven swing states — Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada — appear to be dead heats that could easily be decided by less than 1% of the vote. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin prohibit the counting of mail-in ballots until Election Day, which slows the tally. Arizona and Nevada also tend to have slow vote counting. And this time around, both parties have armies of lawyers ready to contest any irregularity in court.\nIn 2020, Pennsylvania took five days to certify Biden’s win in the state, even though news networks projected the outcome on Election Day. Financial markets can move on wisps of information, so in a close vote count this year, DJT would likely be moving on hints that the final tally will go one way or another, well ahead of any official count.\nThe election will be a reckoning for DJT, which went public in March at around $50. The company has little revenue and poor financial performance — and would probably have no chance if not for Trump’s presidential bid, which could bring millions of new users if he wins. The stock's value has yo-yoed this year, in sync with Trump's electoral fortunes, hitting a high of $66 in March and a low of $12 in September. It's been on an upswing since the beginning of October, with shares up 108% to about $33.50.\nThe stock is massively volatile, with an “implied volatility,” or IV, of around 300%. That’s off the charts. IV reflects the range of bets traders are placing on the future price of the stock. An IV of around 20% is normal. A stock’s IV might surpass 100% prior to an unusual event such as a clinical trial for a make-or-break pharmaceutical. Hardly any company reaches Trumpian levels of volatility.\nOption traders love volatility because it represents an unusual chance to score a big profit with manageable levels of risk. “Volatility is a shiny thing for traders, and right now DJT is the shiniest that exists,” said Hale. DJT is similar to a meme stock that trades for reasons unrelated to the company’s fundamentals, except for one thing: The 2024 election is a singular event that will have a binary outcome and possibly determine the company’s fate.\nStandard formulas for pricing an option trade suggest DJT stock could go as high as $39.35 or as low as $16.33 within two weeks of Election Day. What the trading data doesn’t reveal is which outcome, up or down, is more likely. Traders often hedge bullish bets on a higher price with bearish bets on a lower price, hoping to profit by finding gaps or spreads giving them an edge no matter what the outcome.\nFrenzied option betting, such as that on DJT, also requires market-makers selling options to buy more actual stock in order to keep their own risks neutral. That in itself can push the stock price up, creating the false impression of bullish sentiment when, in reality, the buying is driven by temporary derisking that will subside.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nBetting markets are another Trump trade that has moved in Trump’s favor recently. From late August to early October, Trump and Harris were within a couple points of each other in betting markets, with Harris ahead for part of that time. But Trump is now ahead by roughly 60% to 40% in the RealClearPolitics aggregate, drawn from eight betting pools operated offshore, which Americans are not allowed to bet on but probably do through cryptocurrency and anonymous accounts.\nPolymarket has drawn attention because of one “whale” known as Fredi9999 who has wagered more than $18 million on Trump winning the electoral vote, the popular vote, and certain states. The Wall Street Journal recently posited that one individual controls the Fredi account, plus three others accounting for $30 million in Polymarket wagers on Trump. Large wagers can change betting odds in their own right because they sometimes force bookmakers to adjust the odds just to assure they’re not overexposed to a small bet or group of bets.\nBetting markets don’t reflect a candidate’s real election odds. One simple reason is that people who participate in betting markets are self-selected and don’t necessarily represent the electorate. Most political analysts say betting markets overstate Trump’s odds, with the presidential race essentially too close to call.\nThose rising odds for Trump could make traders more eager to bet on DJT, however, pushing the stock’s volatility even higher than it would otherwise be. And this is all before any meaningful counting of votes.\nThe unruly 2024 election is also, for the time being, a surreal investing opportunity.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Donald Trump’s political fortunes are beginning to diverge from his financial ones.\nShares in the former president’s social media group plumbed fresh all-time lows on Monday, even as the latest polls suggest he’s gaining ground in a few key battleground states in the nation’s sunbelt.\nUntil recently, the price of his Truth Social parent company was widely viewed as a barometer of his chances in November.\nOn Monday, a poll published by The New York Times and Siena College showed him holding onto his lead in Georgia while pulling ahead of Harris in Arizona and North Carolina following their contentious debate this month that saw Trump go viral for claiming immigrants are eating pets.\nIt also marked the sixth straight day of heavy selling in Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent of Twitter clone Truth Social, after a very brief respite when Trump told reporters he had no intention of selling his nearly 115 million shares of stock.\nIt closed down 10% on the session to finish at $12.15, its lowest level since it first announced three years ago plans to go public via a reverse merger with a blank check investment vehicle known as a SPAC.\nThat means the value of Trump’s 59% stake in the company, which was until this week subject to a six-month lockup period following the SPAC merger, has dwindled to just $1.4 billion from its peak in March of more than $9 billion.\nAssuming Trump doesn’t sell his stake as he claims, the selling pressure will not necessarily let up, either.\nWith its meme stock image and refusal to reveal anything about the underlying metrics driving its business, the stock is shunned by financial analysts.\nThere’s not one estimate on Yahoo Finance for this year’s revenue, let alone earnings or, in TMTG’s case, losses.\nApplying the same 7.5x price-to-sales multiple for next year’s revenue that Reddit currently trades to TMTG stock would give it a market cap of around $25 million.\nThat’s a fraction of the $2.4 billion that TMTG, on track for annual sales well below $4 million (with an ‘m’), is currently worth.\nExcluding the $344 million raised from the SPAC deal—cash for which investors typically do not assign a multiple beyond their stated value—the amount of total assets on its books that can potentially generate profits for shareholders amounted to just $12.5 million at the end of June.\nFortune could not reach TMTG officials for comment. When contacted via TMTG’s Truth Social, Trump did not respond to a request for a statement.\nGiven Trump’s need to drum up cash to meet legal fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars and the lack of unencumbered assets he can easily liquidate, investors seem unwilling to take the former White House resident’s words at face value.\nLast week, he announced his latest merchandising plan: selling one-ounce silver coins embossed with his face for $100 each—more than three times their current intrinsic value.\nChamath Palihapitiya, an early Facebook investor best known for promoting SPACs during their pandemic-era boom, ironically predicted TMTG was “a directional bet on the value of his brand” and something akin to the Official Trump Coin just unveiled.\nSpeaking on the All-In podcast shortly after TMTG began trading in March, he said the stock is “effectively a trading coin, a baseball card if you will—a trading card via a stock” that banks on the former president’s name recognition and likeness.\nTrump may have inadvertently hurt his own investment story by declaring on Sunday he wouldn’t run again for the presidency should he lose in November. By taking him out of any future races, he stands to lose his influence on shaping the Republican party.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Slowing revenue growth and reduced margins may have spoiled the party for Lockheed Martin (LMT) shareholders, but the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 this year. Trump’s election victory has spurred hopes of increased spending on defense though, sending the stock higher.\nLockheed Martin is a leader in the aerospace and defense sectors focusing on the research, design, development, and manufacture of advanced technology systems, mostly for military purposes. Their technologies also encompass space systems and cybersecurity solutions.\nThe company was founded in 1995 through the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta and is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland.\nLMT’s leading products include military aircraft like the fighter jets F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II. It makes unmanned air vehicles that have recently become a common element in global conflicts. Its missile systems such as the THAAD and the Javelin anti-tank missiles offer optimal solutions to countries looking to strengthen their defense systems.\nWhen it comes to space, the company makes the Orion spacecraft for NASA's Artemis program. It also offers simulation and training solutions and cybersecurity services.\nThe company is one of the largest defense contractors globally, with 70% of total revenue coming from defense contracts. Even though most of these defense contracts come from within the US, the company plays a vital role in providing defense infrastructure to American allies. Its commercial aerospace division contributes about 20%, and other services add around 10%.\nLockheed Martin’s top clients are the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and international defense agencies and governments.\nThe election of Donald Trump as the 47th US President has raised the prospects of increased defense spending. Together with increasing geo-political tensions in the world and Lockheed’s position as a partner of choice for many US allies, the company’s prospects are getting brighter under a Trump administration, driving our bullish thesis.\nTake for instance the Taiwan developments. The country, which desperately needs to strengthen its defense capabilities to protect itself from Chinese aggression, plans to buy as many as 60 F-35 fighter jets from LMT. The Aegis naval weapon system, a total weapon system from detection to kill, is also rumored to be on the country’s shopping list. These purchases will likely drive positive sentiment as it will ensure LMT is always the company of choice for Taiwan when it comes to its defensive systems.\nAn increased defense spending in the US will also spur a new wave of spending in Europe, which also finds itself embroiled in a conflict. LMT’s 26% revenue comes from non-US customers(10% from Europe) and this part is likely to pick up pace in the coming years. It will not only further diversify the company’s revenue streams but also further strengthen its already solid finances.\nLockheed Martin is not on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 56 hedge fund portfolios held LMT at the end of the second quarter which was 47 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of LMT as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as LMT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\nDisclosure: None.

        "article_content": "JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon is optimistic about President-elect Donald Trump's plans to cut back on regulations and he says Wall Street bankers are thrilled. In a recent talk during the APEC CEO Summit in Peru, Dimon said that the industry is hopeful that Trump's win will result in less red tape, allowing banks to do more of what they do best: lend money.\nDon't Miss:\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest TODAY for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\"A lot of bankers, they're like dancing in the street because they've had successive years and years of regulations, a lot of which stymied credit,\" Dimon said. His point is that all the rules implemented over the past years have made it harder for banks to lend money, impacting businesses and the overall economy.\nDimon explained that banks in the U.S. used to lend out $100 for every $100 in deposits they held. But now, with all the restrictions, they only lend about $65 for every $100 in deposits. He feels that tougher laws have made it difficult for banks to perform their functions and that reducing these rules could help.\n\"If that's what you want, if for some reason the regulators think they're geniuses and that's the best way to run the banking system, so be it,\" Dimon said. He also pointed out that regulators likely didn't anticipate the negative effect that their rules would have on credit and lending.\nSee Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nBanking regulations were put in place primarily to ensure the stability and safety of the financial system, protect consumers and prevent reckless behavior that could lead to economic crises. After the 2008 financial crisis, regulations were tightened to reduce the risks banks could take with their lending and investment practices. These rules are crucial in maintaining trust in the banking sector, preventing another financial meltdown and ensuring that banks operate responsibly without jeopardizing the broader economy.\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\nDimon applauded Trump's intentions to streamline government and reduce the regulatory burden, highlighting that the right changes could help bankers and many industries. \"You could talk to any industry and they'll give you examples of regulations that could be reduced to make it easier for them to do business while keeping the country safe,\" Dimon added.\nTrump has already started putting together a team to tackle these issues. He recently announced that Tesla CEO Elon Musk and pharma entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy would lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new task force focused on cutting down excessive regulations. The goal is to reduce wasteful government spending and restructure federal agencies.\nRead Next:\nInspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets – with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26/share!\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "article_content": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has been talking regularly to both presidential campaigns in the final stretch of the 2024 contest.\nThe growing question is whether he will throw his support behind either candidate. The boss of the biggest US bank hinted Tuesday that such a move may be possible.\n\"I will decide, and I will vote,\" Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview. \"I reserve the right to do whatever I want. I'm a citizen. I can vote. I can say what I want. I've never been in the habit of endorsing candidates. But I am thinking through what I want to say or do or something like that.\"\nBut whom he might support or whether he will do so at all is far from a foregone conclusion as he sends signals both publicly and privately that have been embraced by both sides.\nDimon’s dialogue with both campaigns is happening on a weekly basis with allies of both candidates, according to people familiar with the talks.\nThe conversations have included informal and formal advisers to both campaigns, one of these people said, a list that includes both current and former Cabinet members.\nThe tenor of his conversations with the Trump campaign is an agreement on pro-business policies to grow the economy.\nIt's a level of agreement that Trump's team clearly hopes could lead to more.\nBoth Dimon and former President Trump \"share support of commonsense policies like a government efficiency commission that would eliminate fraud and save taxpayer dollars,\" Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement.\nRead more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts\nBut Dimon has also offered public support for key Harris priorities, including new tax credits to lower-income Americans.\nDimon has more engagement at the moment with the Harris campaign, one of these people said, as the CEO offers feedback on the vice president's economic agenda. Dimon has talked with Harris directly within the last three weeks, this person added.\nThe scrutiny of Dimon's views is intensifying, with a possible endorsement looming as one of the campaign's final most sought-after prizes. Just last week Donald Trump’s account even posted a false claim of a Dimon endorsement.\nThe banker’s eventual retirement as top boss of JPMorgan adds another wrinkle to the intense focus on his actions, as the bank prepares possible successors once Dimon is ready to leave.\nThe 68-year-old CEO and executive chairman for JPMorgan holds an outsized sway across Wall Street.\nThus, in addition to a possible endorsement, both campaigns are also eager for his support on their economic narratives.\nFor instance, Harris could gain support if Dimon says he isn't worried about inflation — while Trump's side would surely prefer him to focus on problems with the economy.\nTrump and Dimon also have had a hot-and-cold relationship that stretches back for years.\nTrump reportedly courted Dimon for a Cabinet role as far back as 2016. When that didn't work out, Trump later claimed the banker \"is a poor public speaker & nervous mess.\"\nJust this summer, Trump mentioned Dimon as a possible Treasury Secretary in June before backtracking in July.\nLikewise, Dimon encouraged primary season opposition to Trump earlier in this election season, but in a January CNBC interview, he offered kinder words.\n\"Take a step back, be honest. He was kind of right about NATO, kind of right on immigration,\" said Dimon. \"He grew the economy quite well,\" he added.\nThe latest wrinkle came when Trump's Truth Social account posted a false post on Friday that claimed an endorsement. The banker's aides quickly shot it down and confirmed it to be false.\nTrump sought to distance himself from the post, telling an NBC reporter traveling with him, \"I don't know anything about it,\" and adding, \"Somebody put it up.\"\nYet the false post remains live as of Tuesday evening.\n\"President Trump often discusses the future of our nation with the best and smartest people, and alongside leaders like Dimon, he will restore America's economy to make life affordable again in a second term,\" added Hughes of the Trump campaign.\nDimon's relationship with Harris is equally lengthy — and fraught.\nIn her 2019 autobiography, Harris recounted a tense exchange when she, then California's attorney general, was helping negotiate a settlement between banks and homeowners who faced foreclosure during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"We were like two dogs in a fight,\" Harris recounted of the phone call with Dimon.\nThe battle raged over an offer from a group of banks that included JPMorgan of between $2 billion and $4 billion in compensation for California and four other states. That offer was eventually raised to $20 billion, of which $13 billion came from JPMorgan ($9 billion in cash and $4 billion in borrower relief).\nHarris and Dimon appear to have been more cordial as of late. They met for lunch in Washington in March as part of what a person familiar with the discussion then described as Harris's regular outreach to business leaders.\nDimon has also offered support for Harris's priorities. The vice president has made expanding the earned income tax credit for low-to-moderate-income workers and families a centerpiece of her economic plan. Dimon has often touted the credit and has called support for it \"a no-brainer.\"\nDimon has also offered conditional support for raising taxes on the richest Americans to align with the so-called \"Buffett rule\" that the richest Americans shouldn't have an effective tax rate lower than the middle class.\nDimon's wife, Judy, is also on the record as a Harris supporter. She has donated over a quarter of a million dollars to support the Democratic ticket, according to government records.\nJamie Dimon, meanwhile, has only made a few smaller donations this campaign season totaling about $20,000, those records show. He has also split his money between moderate Democrats like Jon Tester of Montana and conservative Republicans like Joni Ernst of Iowa.\nFurther clouding the dynamic and the question of an endorsement in the coming weeks is whether Dimon would be interested in a role in either future administration.\nEarlier this year, he offered some indication that the timetable for his retirement may be nearing. It's \"not five years anymore,\" Dimon said in May while speaking at his bank's annual investor day in New York City.\nIn past years, when asked about the topic, his default response was to say he would stay in the job for another five years.\nDimon has also been for years frequently linked to top roles in Washington.\nAs far back as President Obama's time in office, Dimon was mentioned as a possible Treasury Secretary. Billionaire Warren Buffett even offered his endorsement in 2012.\nThis year, Dimon has offered an array of commentary on what direction he'd like to see the campaign take this year but avoided specifics.\nDuring his conversation with Bloomberg this week, Dimon said, \"I just want to help our government do the right stuff\" and offered Dwight Eisenhower as a model president.\n\"He got the right people there. ... He never blamed people. He never insulted people,\" said Dimon, adding, \"It's a more unifying leadership [than] yelling or scream[ing] at each other.\"\nDimon also published an op-ed with the Washington Post in August, describing in gauzy terms how he hopes the next US president will embrace the concept of unity.\n\"We live in a perilous time,\" he wrote. \"If we're going to truly unify our country, we need to begin treating opposing views, complaints and critiques as opportunities to find common ground and make us better.\"\nHe concluded that if the next president took his advice — no matter who he or she is — they \"could be one of our greatest presidents.\"\nCorrection: A settlement between banks and five states including California resulted in $20 billion of compensation for those states, of which $13 billion came from JPMorgan. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the $20 billion came entirely from JPMorgan and that the amount went entirely to California.\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.

        "article_content": "The public drama surrounding most of Donald Trump’s cabinet choices so far came after they were announced, but not so much for the closely watched contest to become the next Treasury secretary.\nThe frenzy of that race is playing out before a pick is even made.\nThe two leading contenders — between private entreaties and Fox News appearances and op-eds — are making a case directly to the president-elect as well as through public signals to perhaps sway markets to their side.\nHanging over the entire process is President-elect Trump himself, who has already surprised political observers multiple times this week by discarding conventional choices for other posts and announcing nominees that few saw coming.\n\"Trump of course likes to do things a bit differently, as we’ve noticed,\" said Puck News founding partner William D. Cohan on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance’s Capitol Gains podcast.\nOne notable subplot in recent days surrounds Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, who is heading up Trump’s transition team but has also emerged as a candidate in his own right.\nHe's \"interested in pulling a bit of a Dick Cheney here,\" Cohan added in reference to how Cheney famously headed up George W. Bush’s vice presidential search before securing the job for himself.\nIn addition to Lutnick, the other most oft-mentioned name these days is Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management investing chief and regular campaign trail partner of Trump.\nBessent has long been considered a frontrunner for the job and appears set to meet with Trump Friday at Mar-a-Lago for a second face-to-face conversation.\nThere's also a whole stable of dark horse candidates who have appeared on varied lists and could rise in the hours and days ahead depending on Trump's preferences, from former trade representative Robert Lighthizer to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman to former National Economic Council director Gary Cohn to Fox Business Network host Larry Kudlow.\nOn Tuesday, billionaire investor John Paulson took his hat out of the ring for contention for the job, saying \"complex financial obligations\" would keep him in the private sector. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon also made it clear Thursday he won’t be working for Trump in the coming years.\nMuch of the lobbying has taken place behind closed doors as Trump assembles his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to pick his team — and then quickly post them on Truth Social.\nAides have been circumspect, with Karoline Leavitt, a Trump-Vance transition spokesperson, telling Yahoo Finance only that \"President-elect Trump is making decisions on who will serve in his second administration. Those decisions will be announced when they are made.\"\nAs for Treasury, Scott Bessent, the current Key Square Capital Management CEO, has long been considered the favorite. He has has also been making a notably public case in recent days.\nHe was live on the set of Fox and Friends Thursday morning. \"Any way I can help,\" he noted in an interview where he mostly lavished praise on Trump.\nIn recent days, Bessent has also published op-eds in both the Wall Street Journal and on FoxNews.com. He also hopped on with Trump ally Steve Bannon to discuss his vision for the US economy.\nBessent has also donated over $3.1 million to Trump and other Republicans during the recent election season, according to government records.\nHe is expected to meet with the president-elect again on Friday in Florida to discuss the role further.\nBessent also appears to have high-profile lobbyists helping his cause behind the scenes, with Semafor reporting on Thursday that Sen. Lindsey Graham is a leader in pushing Bessent, a fellow South Carolinian, for the job.\nLutnick is best known as the billionaire CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, who was first tapped to shepherd Trump’s picks as the co-chair of his transition effort.\n\"To me, this is an all-in moment,\" he said in his own Fox News appearance a few weeks back.\nBut that appears to have changed, with Lutnick now apparently throwing his hat in the ring for the top job himself and the Wall Street Journal reporting that he has made a pitch directly to Trump himself.\nA representative for the Trump transition declined to comment on Lutnick's role.\nOther names mentioned as more long-shot possibilities include Lighthizer, who was Trump's trade representative last time around and appears set for another role in Trump’s trade and tariff plans in one form or another.\nLighthizer has stayed close to Trump in recent years as the head of the Center for American Trade at the America First Policy Institute, a Trump-aligned think tank.\nGary Cohn, the former Goldman executive who served as the director of Trump’s National Economic Council and is now vice-chairman of IBM, is another long-shot candidate.\nCohn left the White House in 2018 after publicly criticizing Trump’s response to a deadly rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, saying at the time that the Trump administration \"can and must do better\" to condemn hate groups\nCohn has more recently offered praise for Trump and his economic agenda but, in yet another Fox appearance this week, suggested he wasn’t in the running and said he was anxiously awaiting the result like everyone else.\n“I’m actually happy he’s taking his time on the economic decisions,” Cohn added about Trump’s closely watched selection process.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how US policy and government affect your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said President-elect Donald Trump is “very committed” to reforming drug-industry middlemen.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNYPD Car Chases Are Becoming More Frequent — and More Dangerous\nBourla’s remarks, following comments from Trump Monday and continued criticism from members of Congress, suggest pharmacy benefit managers are unlikely to see relief from political scrutiny during a second Trump term.\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. shares fell as much as 4.5%, CVS Health Corp. dropped as much as 3.9% and Cigna Group slid as much as 4.1% after Bourla’s comment.\n“The president has very strong views” on PBMs, Bourla said during a call with analysts following the company’s newly issued 2025 guidance, adding that Trump “wants transparency.”\n“It seems to me that he is very committed to make this happen,” Bourla said.\nUnitedHealth, CVS and Cigna, which own the largest prescription drug middlemen, also saw their shares sink Monday after Trump criticized the system in a news conference.\n“You know the middleman, right?” Trump told reporters Monday. “The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies, and they don’t do anything except they’re a middleman,” he said. “We’re going to knock out the middleman.”\nThese businesses have been blamed by both Republicans and Democrats for driving up the cost of medicine.\n“PBMs are currently in a negative headline spiral,” Leerink Partners analysts said in a note to clients late Monday.\nTrump made his middlemen comment after a dinner he had with leaders from Pfizer, Eli Lilly & Co. and his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nCongress is considering restrictions on PBMs in a year-end spending package that could change the way they get paid, Bloomberg Government reported Dec. 13. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents the companies, said in a statement Monday that such a move would raise costs.\nSeparately, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill last week that would force companies that own insurers or PBMs to divest their pharmacy businesses. If it were to become law, it could disrupt a profitable and growing segment for health conglomerates.\n“Assuming these proposals make it to enactment it would force some adjustments to business models and profit streams but is far from the most draconian potential proposals such as forced divestitures of owned pharmacies,” the Leerink analysts wrote.\nPBMs’ profit margins are typically smaller than those of drug manufacturers, according to a 2017 analysis by researchers at the University of Southern California.\n--With assistance from Angel Adegbesan.\n(Updates throughout)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Property Brothers Say Hold Off on the Big Home Renovation in 2025\nChina’s Housing Rescue Falls Short in City That Signaled the Crisis\nCrypto Got What It Wanted in November’s Election.

        "article_content": "Silicon Valley venture capitalists who donated hundreds of millions to Trump are bracing for a sea change in tech.\n\"I think there's going to be a renaissance of innovation in America and we're going to do more in four years than we've done the last 40 years,\" Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist, told Yahoo Finance. \"So buckle up. It's gonna be pretty, pretty exciting to see.\"\nIn June, Pishevar co-hosted a Trump fundraiser at the home of entrepreneur, podcaster, and investor David Sacks that raised $12 million in one day. Trump's reelection ticket was also bankrolled by Silicon Valley heavyweights like Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel. Prior to politics, the vice president-elect, Ohio Senator JD Vance, also had a short stint in VC and has close ties to Thiel.\nVice President Kamala Harris, who rose to political prominence in the Bay Area, had the backing of nearly 900 venture capitalists in a movement dubbed \"VCs for Kamala.\" Supporters included Mark Cuban, Vinod Khosla, Ron Conway, and Reid Hoffman. Still, that wasn't enough.\n\"I think it's really important to highlight that there is an internal conversation happening in Silicon Valley,\" Stephen DeBerry, VC and Harris supporter, said.\n\"Who are we building for? My proposed answer to that question is simple: It's everyone. Because we have the capacity to do that. We can do that, and that's what great nations do. If we answer that question the wrong way and build for some, but not all, I fear for the future of this country.\"\nMost investors and founders Yahoo Finance spoke to expect Trump 2.0 to help clear regulatory hurdles, making it easier to innovate and sell their companies. Some said their frustrations with Democratic policies boiled down to higher taxes, overregulation, and antitrust laws.\n\"The tech ecosystem is going to grow really fast — much faster than the last four years,\" Pishevar said. \"It's been stalled the last four years. VC's have had difficulty raising capital and I think things are going to change. We're really excited about those changes.\"\nAmong Trump's early agenda may be to undo President Biden's executive order on AI. He also said he plans to install a sweeping tariff policy: 10%-20% on all imports, and an additional 60%-100% on Chinese goods.\n\"I was in a board meeting today and one of my companies uses raw products that come from China — paper products that are printed there,\" DeBerry said. \"So we feel like we are immediately subject to some kind of impact due to tariffs. That is going to flow through to pressure on consumers, unfortunately.\"\nDespite the fears by some, Wall Street has rallied hard this week following Trump's victory. The gains have been led by big-cap tech names such as Nvidia (NVDA).\n\"The markets are a signal of what's coming,\" Pishevar said. \"I think we're going to have an economic boom, we'll control inflation, create a lot of jobs.\"\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who also owns X (formerly known as Twitter), SpaceX, Neuralink, and generative AI startup xAI, has donated more than $130 million to the Trump campaign.\nFollowing the win, his net worth rose by more than $20 billion as shares of Tesla jumped nearly 15% on Wednesday. In his victory speech, Trump praised Musk as a \"new star\" and \"super genius.\"\n“We have to protect our super geniuses,” Trump told the crowd on election night. While Trump and Musk have so far dismissed the idea that Musk would hold an official government position, it's speculated that Musk will be an influential adviser.\n\"I think America needs to be run like a startup,\" Pishevar said about Musk's role. \"And Elon is the best entrepreneur that we've ever had.\"\nMusk has championed the idea of helming a \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE). \"We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook,\" Musk said at a Trump rally in New York City last month.\nHe added he could slash at least $2 trillion from the US budget. According to the Treasury Department, the federal government spent $6.75 trillion in fiscal year 2024.\nWhile Trump didn't say much about AI during his campaign, a second presidency could mean a shakeup in the AI leaderboard.\n\"AI is going to accelerate so fast we're going to reach AGI or super intelligence within the next two to three years,\" Pishevar said. \"I think there will be Manhattan projects for AI, quantum computing, biotech.\"\nMusk's xAI would benefit from light-touch legislation, though Musk has been a supporter of some AI regulation, including California's controversial AI bill that was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom.\nWhile Silicon Valley remains split on its tech vision for the Trump presidency, DeBerry said it's not about politics.\n\"If we can come to a consensus that we actually care about building a great society, then I'm excited in that context,\" DeBerry said. \"So the question isn't about technology. The question isn't about economic capability. The question is about our will.\"\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "date": "2024-01-09T18:19:36.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump says he believes the U.S. economy is going to “crash.” In fact, he wants it to do just that—as long as it happens soon. In a Monday interview on Lindell TV (an online program created, hosted, and funded by noted conspiracy theorist and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell), the former president said he didn’t want to be compared to Herbert Hoover, who took office at the start of the Great Depression in 1929, if he wins another term in the White House.\n“When there’s a crash, I hope it’s going to be during this next 12 months because I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover. The one president—I just don’t want to be Herbert Hoover,” Trump said, CNN first reported.\nIn the past, Herbert Hoover was routinely blamed for the Great Depression, despite taking office less than a year before the stock market crash of 1929 struck, signaling the beginning of an era of economic pain for the U.S. Since the 1970s, however, historians and economists have viewed Hoover in a different light. Although some scholars still criticize him for refusing to offer large-scale relief programs that would have helped Americans cope with the Great Depression, his actions after the 1929 stock market crash—and his policies throughout his presidency—have been lauded by some in hindsight.\nThe New York Times argued in a 1930 article that \"no one in his place could have done more\" to fix the stock market’s long-brewing crisis, as Stanford Magazine explained in a 1999 article. And an advisor to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt admitted in the 1930s that “practically the whole New Deal was extrapolated from programs that Hoover started,” arguing “his policies were substantially correct.\"\nStill, no president wants to take office when the economy is struggling. Trump has repeatedly attacked President Joe Biden’s economic policies during the run-up to the Republican primaries, where Trump is the current front-runner. In the interview with Lindell, he claimed Biden's economy was currently “running off the fumes” of his administration.\nLindell TV airs on the FrankSpeech network, which was also created by Lindell. He claims to have put $12 million into its creation and says it averages 4 million viewers per month. Beyond his own show, the network is also home to Lou Dobbs, who was fired by Fox News three years ago in the wake of a $2.7 billion defamation suit from the voting technology company Smartmatic.\nDespite Trump’s comments, the economy has shown signs of strength recently, and Wall Street has begun to believe that a soft landing—where inflation fades without rising interest rates sparking a job-killing recession—is not only possible, but likely.\nRecent economic data, including the December jobs and consumer spending reports, have been better than expected. And after a brutal 2022, the S&P 500 finished 2023 up roughly 24%. For its part, the White House, in a statement to CNN, chastised Trump for his comments, saying, “A commander-in-chief’s duty is to always put the American people first; never to hope that hardworking families suffer economic pain for their own political benefit.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "title": "Trump warns John Deere of ‘200% tariff’ but market shrugs off the threat",
        "date": "2024-12-09T21:00:33.000Z",
        "article_content": "John Deere is the latest company to draw the ire of former President Donald Trump for investing south of the U.S. border. At an event Monday in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, the Republican nominee threatened the company with a “200% tariff” if it shifts some production to Mexico as planned, causing the stock to briefly sag in after-hours trading.\nFacing rising costs and declining demand, John Deere announced earlier this year that it would lay off over 800 workers across factories in Illinois and Iowa. The company has also bought land in Ramos, Mexico, for a new facility that will take over production currently done at its plant in Dubuque, Iowa.\n“I am just notifying John Deere right now that if you do that, we are putting a 200% tariff on everything that you want to sell into the United States,” Trump said at roundtable focused on threats to U.S. farmers, principally from China. \nAs he did in 2016, Trump has made protectionism a key component of his campaign. He’s proposed a worldwide tariff of 10%, as well as a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods. He’s also resumed his attacks on American companies expanding in Mexico, a consistent refrain since his first run to the White House.\n“They think they are going to make product cheaper in Mexico and then sell it in for the same prices they did before,” he said Monday of John Deere, “making a lot of money by getting rid of our labor and our jobs.”\nIn response, the company has pointed reporters to a statement on its website that touts the company’s commitment to U.S. manufacturing, including $2 billion invested in domestic plants since 2019.\n“In order to position our U.S. factories to undertake these highly value-additive activities it is sometimes necessary to move less complex operations, such as cab assembly, to other locations,” the statement said.\nJohn Deere shares recovered by Tuesday afternoon, trading slightly above the previous day’s close. While the stock is up just 2.5% this year, trailing the 21% gain for the S&P 500, it’s beating the index over the last five years roughly 150% to 93%, respectively.\nThe company is far from the first targeted by Trump over moving production to Mexico, though the former president's claims of job displacement have often been exaggerated. Trump famously called for a boycott of Oreos in 2016 after Nabisco parent Mondelez said it would be shutting some production lines at its Chicago factory while boosting output in Mexico. The future president falsely claimed the factory was being closed.\nThat year, Trump also attacked U.S. automakers like Ford and General Motors. He went after climate and energy company Carrier for its plans to shutter two Indiana plants and move manufacturing to Mexico. At one point, he called on Americans to stop buying iPhones.\nJohn Deere may be reassured from past examples, however, that the former president can be placated if he returns to the White House. After winning in 2016, Trump took credit for several decisions by Ford to scrap or adjust plans in Mexico and add jobs in the U.S. The company said those moves would have been made even if he had not been elected, though then-CEO Mark Fields did characterize them as a \"vote of confidence\" in Trump's tax and regulatory proposals.\nTrump did undoubtedly convince Carrier to change course, calling the CEO of its then-parent, United Technologies, shortly after being elected. A few days later, the company and president-elect announced a deal to keep roughly 1,100 jobs in the U.S., though the Washington Post later reported a greater number of positions in the state were cut in the years that followed.\nIf past examples are any indication, John Deere can expect to stay in Trump's crosshairs throughout election season. Whether the results on Nov. 5 could push the company to change its plans, however, remains unclear.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "Yahoo Finance is spending the final days of the 2024 campaign examining key economic decisions that, like it or not, will confront the next president. For an even deeper look at all of the financial issues that matter most to your pocketbook, please see Yahoo Finance’s interactive guide to the 2024 election.\nOne of Donald Trump's most remarkable accomplishments in office was how he reoriented the political landscape around trade and tariffs, ushering in a new era of higher duties that have persisted and even grown slightly during the Biden administration.\nThe decision facing voters in this election is whether he will be able to upend the status quo again.\nVice President Kamala Harris and her aides have offered little detail on her trade plans, but if she makes any moves at all, she is widely expected to keep the Trump-created new normal of higher duties in place — with a possible focus on new duties on \"strategic sectors.\"\nTrump, by contrast, is promising a new wave in the ballpark of 10 times the level of tariffs he put in place in his first term, experts said, with a plan that includes across-the-board tariffs of 10% or higher and 60% tariffs on China.\nHe is also promising things like a Trump Reciprocal Trade Act that would automatically put tariffs on nations in response to their duties on the US.\nThe effects would be felt across American life, even if Trump delivers on just a fraction of his promises.\nOne thing that appears off the table, at least for now, is a lowering of duties anytime soon.\n\"Cutting tariffs is not in the cards for anybody,\" Richard Baldwin, a professor of International Economics at the International Institute for Management Development, said in a recent interview.\nBaldwin added of Trump's promises that \"I think we have to take him at his word,\" noting that he has the power to levy his tariff regime unilaterally.\nDuring his term in office, then-President Trump imposed duties on a wide array of products from China as well as things like aluminum and steel products from Europe and Asia.\nIt marked about $80 billion in new duties, which companies pay at US ports of entry.\nThe Biden administration largely left Trump's tariffs in place and even announced new duties this May on \"strategic sectors\" such as semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nHarris is expected to continue this general approach and has unveiled a reindustrialization strategy aimed at encouraging specific sectors in the US — from aerospace to AI to quantum computing to critical minerals.\nHer focus has not been on any new tariffs at campaign stops but instead on government inducements for certain industries, similar to Biden-era accomplishments like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act focused on semiconductors.\nBiden's and Harris's aides have long pointed to a recent boom in US factory construction as evidence their approach is the one that works.\nHarris has also been critical of Trump's plans for new tariffs, likening them to a national sales tax that she said would add over $3,900 to a typical family budget, as companies that pay the duties pass along the tariff taxes to the final consumers.\nRead more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts\nBut the politics around tariffs could forestall any efforts to roll back existing duties, which notably poll well, especially in certain swing states.\n\"If she wins, she won't win because of California,\" William Alan Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a recent interview, citing Harris's home state where tariffs are less popular.\n\"She'll win because of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the trade politics there haven't changed,\" he added, noting the widespread support for existing duties on things like steel, aluminum, and autos.\n\"She brings a different mentality to the job,\" he said of her California background as well as of the selection of Tim Walz from agriculture-dependent Minnesota, which was hit hard during Trump's first round of tariffs.\n\"But it doesn't change the politics.\"\nWhen it comes to Trump, the former president has a record of keeping his trade promises and is pledging what would be historic duties.\nTrump calls tariffs \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" and has even floated things like 2,000% tariffs on autos and said his aim in some areas is to implement \"the highest tariff in history.\"\nPerhaps the only question, with Trump likely able to cut Congress out of the loop and pursue his policies unilaterally, is whether courts intervene.\nRead more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?\nA recent analysis from Reinsch and Warren Maruyama, a former general counsel at the US Trade Representative, laid out the extensive authorities that allow presidents to impose tariffs on their own.\nAnother analysis from Alan Wolff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics warned of underestimating Trump's tariffs. He noted the unilateral powers a president enjoys and the unprecedented levels tariffs could reach.\nThe effect \"on the economy, on businesses, and on individual consumers and workers would literally be incalculable,\" he wrote.\nThat leaves the courts, where past challenges to Trump's tariffs haven't been successful. That could change depending on how vigorously Trump tried to pursue a potential second-term agenda.\n\"No matter what he does, he'll be sued,\" Reinsch said, adding that perhaps the easiest legal path for Trump would be to begin with his plan for 60% tariffs on China.\n\"You declare an emergency, and you use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,\" he noted, adding, \"It works better when there's a targeted offender.\"\nBaldwin added that political repercussions could be the only check on Trump's agenda.\nHe predicts that only those 60% tariffs on China could \"lead to an inflation surge, especially on the middle class. That makes the last couple of years look like a small thing.\"\nAnd that's even before China retaliates, he added, which \"could do a lot of damage.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-11-19T20:46:47.000Z",
        "article_content": "What a difference an election can make. For years, the crypto industry wandered in the political wilderness of the Biden era, while many companies mulled pulling out of the U.S. altogether. Now, fresh off a campaign season that saw crypto leaders spend over $100 million, the industry is welcome in the highest corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\nThis newfound influence was reflected in a phone call this week between President-elect Donald Trump to Brian Armstrong, founder and CEO of Coinbase. Armstrong and his company poured nearly $50 million into supporting pro-crypto candidates, whose ranks now include Trump, a onetime Bitcoin skeptic who became a full-on convert to digital currency earlier this year.\nIn recent months, Trump has floated ideas like a crypto advisory council and a strategic reserve for Bitcoin. He also counts a number of longtime crypto boosters in his inner circle, including Elon Musk and the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, whose firm helps manage the reserves of stablecoin giant Tether and who on Tuesday was tapped to be Commerce Secretary.\nA person familiar with the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Armstrong and Trump did not discuss specific appointments but instead spoke about crypto on a broader level. Coinbase declined to comment on the call. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the two would meet.\nThere have also been unconfirmed reports on X that another prominent crypto CEO, Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse, has had direct access to the President-elect. A Ripple spokesperson told Fortune the company does not discuss private conversations.\nAccording to the person familiar with the Trump-Armstrong call, as well as a well-known D.C. crypto figure, the industry's primary focus for now is who will be appointed to lead two key financial agencies: the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities and Exchange Futures Commission.\n\"The SEC is where all the damage is being carried out,\" said the Washington, D.C., figure, citing a wave of lawsuits unleashed by Chairman Gary Gensler. While Gensler is expected to be gone by the end of the year, the person said it remains uncertain whether the agency will immediately call off numerous cases not related to fraud. They added that an interim chair would be less likely to take this step.\nMeanwhile, the CFTC could take on a greatly expanded role in the crypto realm if legislation goes forward to strip the SEC of some of its proclaimed powers over digital assets and hands them to the commodities regulator instead. Among the front-runners to be the next leader of the CFTC are two crypto industry favorites: Summer Mersinger, who is a current commissioner; and Milbank lawyer Josh Sterling, who has regularly pled cases before the industry.\nA final role the crypto industry is watching closely: who is selected to be the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, a position that helps oversee regulations related to money laundering and illicit banking.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

This not only saves time but also cuts operational costs — something that is vital for startups working on tight budgets.”\nAs an example, Langley shared that his company benefited from “increased flexibility in our expansion plans due to federal regulations being slashed under Trump’s first term, which enabled us to innovate and respond more quickly to what the market demanded.”\nDiscover More: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes — 3 Items That Would Instantly Get More Expensive\nEntrepreneurs also could benefit significantly from infrastructure development initiatives that are proposed by Trump, Langley suggested.\nWhen it comes to helping entrepreneurs, Mary Safar, the owner of Fine Signs of LA, believes a second Trump term “would involve increased spending on infrastructure, thereby creating more business opportunities within this sector.”\nLangley said improved infrastructure could reduce transportation costs and help expand market reach.\n“Favorable trade policies might open up international markets leading to growth opportunities through diversification,” he said. “My business stands a chance of sourcing materials more efficiently and reaching out to a wider customer base if there could be better infrastructures coupled with good trade deals, hence driving growth plus innovation.”\n“Domestic production could be promoted through tariffs and other incentives so that it becomes much cheaper for entrepreneurs to get their materials locally while also making finished goods here in America,” Safar said.\nSafar added that this would simplify supply chains, which could lead to stronger local economies.\nIf Trump continues tax incentives for businesses and lowers corporate taxes, it could help entrepreneurs, according to Langley.\n“These could free up capital for startups through incentives for reinvestment, thereby enabling such enterprises to invest in technology, create more jobs or scale up their operations,” he said. “When there is a strong economy, people have confidence in it as well [as] spend more money, which would greatly benefit companies like Patio Doors who rely heavily on home improvement trends and discretionary spending.”\nGetting the funding for small business or startup can be difficult; however, there is the potential that with Trump back in the White House more entrepreneurs would have access to initial capital to get their companies started on the right financial footing.\n“Entrepreneurs might benefit from programs supporting small businesses with grants or loans under another regime led by Donald Trump,” Safar said. “Most startups need funds at some point during their growth journey, hence this move may avail such resources easily for them.”\nMost entrepreneurs predicted that if Trump wins a second term, there most likely would be fewer rules and lower taxes. This could potentially lower the barrier for people looking to make their own businesses.\nShould regulations be pulled back, businesses could operate more freely, theoretically allowing new ideas to generate. With anticipation that American manufacturing and job growth would flourish under Trump, more customers might seek out local services, an economic factor that could benefit businesses old and new.\n“A second Trump Administration could catalyze entrepreneurial success by providing a business-friendly environment with deregulation, tax relief and special support for women entrepreneurs,” Salahi said. “Further underscoring small business interests, this administration would let American entrepreneurship reach its full potential to drive innovation and economic growth.”\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "date": "2024-07-18T17:31:28.000Z",
        "article_content": "I get lower tariffs, you get a new Mac: the art of the deal!\nApple CEO Tim Cook gifted former President Donald Trump a $6,000 Mac Pro computer after the two men reached a deal for the tech giant to receive an exemption to a series of tariffs in 2019, according to Bloomberg.\nAt the time Apple and Cook were applying a charm offensive to persuade then-President Trump to remove tariffs on certain components that came from China. Cook asked Trump if he could meet him in person to make Apple’s case, a gesture the former president found “impressive,” he told Bloomberg. Trump was particularly pleased at the time that Cook reached out, especially considering his acrimonious relationship with other tech CEOs.\n“Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly,” Trump said in August 2019. “That’s why he’s a great executive, because he calls me, and others don’t.”\nShortly after taking office, Trump had imposed 25% tariffs on 10 parts used in building Mac Pro computers that came from China. The price increase meant potentially billions of dollars in additional costs for Apple, but when Apple first sought an exception on the trade tariffs, Trump responded with his usual obstinance.\n“Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China,” Trump posted on X (still Twitter at the time). “Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!”\nEventually Apple and the Trump administration reached an agreement: The White House would grant Apple an exemption to the tariffs and Apple would build the computers in the U.S. Once the production lines were up and running, Cook gifted Trump one of the first Mac Pros built at the factory, according to Bloomberg. The Mac Pro is Apple’s most powerful computer and generally targeted toward professionals who require large amounts of computing power. It is unclear what Trump did with the gift or how he reacted to receiving it.\nApple and the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the gift.\nIn Trump’s telling of the story, he induced Cook to increase Apple’s manufacturing footprint in the U.S. in exchange for lifting the tariffs. “I said, ‘I’m gonna do something for you guys,’” Trump told Bloomberg, “‘but you have to build in this country.’”\nIn reality, the Mac Pro was already assembled in the U.S. However, Apple still gave Trump the appearance of strong-arming a Big Tech company when it announced a $1 billion investment in an assembly plant in Austin. Apple, though, was planning the investment a year earlier, before the dispute over the Chinese tariffs, according to Bloomberg. Nonetheless, Cook and Trump appeared together in November 2019 at the Austin assembly facility. Observers at the time considered it a minor win for Trump—who got a photo op in an American factory—as well as for Cook—who skirted painful tariffs with a manufacturing investment that had already been in the works at Apple.\nApple and Cook may very well have to resort to the same playbook should Trump take office again. The former president has made no secret of his wish to impose even higher tariffs, up to 60% on any imports from China and 10% on imports from anywhere else. Economists consider the policy inflationary for the entire economy, and analysts believe it would be disastrous for Apple given its heavy reliance on China to manufacture many of its most popular products, like the iPhone.\nAs a likely contingency plan, Apple has been diversifying its production locations away from China. In April, during a trip across South Asia, Cook announced Apple planned to spend more with suppliers in Vietnam and Indonesia, although details were scant.\nStill, given Trump’s desire to impose tariffs on any foreign goods, manufacturing in Vietnam or Indonesia as opposed to China would still result in a cost increase for Apple. For his part, Trump shows little intention on relenting when it comes to tariffs.\n“I can’t believe how many people are negative on tariffs that are actually smart,” Trump told Bloomberg. “Man, is it good for negotiation.”\nIf Trump were indeed to win reelection and implement his tariff policy, Cook will likely bank on his cozy relationship with the former president, which earned him an exemption five years ago. Trump does seem to have a fair amount of goodwill for Cook, the chief executive of the world’s most valuable company.\n“I found him to be a very good businessman,” Trump said about Cook.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "date": "2024-08-02T09:30:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "At a March rally in Ohio, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump broke with party rhetoric on Chinese investment and welcomed carmakers from the country to build factories in the US.\n\"If they want to build a plant in Michigan, in Ohio, in South Carolina, they can - using American workers, they can,\" the former president said in Dayton. It's an invitation he has since repeated, including at the Republican National Convention last month.\nThe remarks also reflect Trump's retreat from his long-time dire rhetoric about electric vehicles, which Chinese carmakers overwhelmingly focus on for international markets.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nWhile the former president has previously only taken hits at EVs - saying that they will \"kill\" the US auto industry and that he would rescind federal support for them - he now strikes a more flexible tone. They're \"incredible\" but \"not for everybody\", he said, after meeting Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk.\nFor Trump, the overture to Chinese companies is an alternative to cheap Chinese autos flooding US markets, a concern that both he and other Republicans like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have repeatedly raised amid reports of Chinese electric vehicle and battery manufacturers considering building plants in Mexico.\nUnder the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as long as 75 per cent of auto content - including key parts - is made in North America, the products can qualify for tariff-free import into the US.\nShould the Chinese manufacturers choose to build in Mexico and ship the final products across the border, Trump said, he would slap them with heavier tariffs.\nAmid already substantial tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries - and fiery rhetoric against Chinese investment - Trump's invitation has the potential to change the course of the US transition to EVs as well as open doors to Chinese business in a segment that has so far appeared closed.\nThough far from fully fleshed out, his pitch is in line with a growing recognition worldwide of China's critical role to the development of the EV industry and suggests an emerging split within the Republican Party about the future of Chinese industrial investment on US soil.\nIndeed, Republicans have made political hay opposing Chinese manufacturers in the US.\nIn 2022, US President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act vastly expanded battery and EV tax credits to reduce reliance on Chinese suppliers, but Chinese companies can still benefit through using carveouts or meeting certain conditions.\nOne company that stood to benefit was Chinese EV battery maker Gotion High-tech, which announced plans for three plants in the states of Michigan, Illinois and California, promising to create American jobs.\nBut such plans triggered local opposition. At a roundtable last Friday, Representative John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House select committee on China, focused on the ties between Chinese companies and the Chinese Communist Party in opposing any role for Gotion in America.\n\"I want to see this area have more jobs and investment but we must not welcome companies that are controlled by people who see us as the enemy,\" Moolenaar said, addressing an audience in Michigan's rural Green Charter Township, where one of the plants would be built.\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his vice-presidential running mate, US Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 16.

Vance of Ohio, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 16. Photo: AP>\nMoolenaar, joined by Representative Darin LaHood, Republican of Illinois, accused Gotion of being linked to forced labour, and promoted a bill they introduced last year that would prevent Chinese companies from benefiting from IRA tax credits.\nWhile the congressmen have yet to adopt a specific stance on Chinese carmakers setting up shop in the US, other stakeholders already have.\nScott Paul, the head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing trade group, called it a \"foolish\" idea. \"At a time when many new and established brands are just scaling up EV production, [a] Beijing-backed Chinese auto juggernaut could wipe them out.\"\nDemocrats, too, have expressed scepticism about letting Chinese carmakers into the US, trying to strike a balance between embracing a green future and guarding against potential national security risks.\n\"The Biden administration worries that Chinese cars, given the number of sensors and cameras and other sorts of devices on them, are essentially, as Gina Raimondo has said, 'spy cameras on wheels',\" said Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to Biden's Commerce secretary.\n\"And that's why Biden's Commerce Department has launched a potential rule making process focused on the data security risks that could potentially shut Chinese car companies out of the US market - even if they're actually manufacturing the cars here,\" he added. That rule making process is expected to be completed later this year.\nChina dominates the global EV industry. In 2021, almost 80 per cent of all lithium-ion batteries for EVs worldwide originated from China, and the International Energy Agency says nearly 60 per cent of global EV sales as of 2023 are Chinese-made.\nChinese electric vehicles are also selling much more competitively with the meteoric rise of China's BYD. The company, which now rivals Tesla as the leading global maker of EVs, sells its cheapest model for about US$21,000 outside China - thousands of dollars less than the cheapest US EV.\nIn May, the Biden administration announced discretionary tariffs of 100 per cent on electric vehicles from China and 25 per cent on Chinese-made lithium-ion batteries for EVs, contending they were in retaliation for Beijing's unfair trade practices.\nThe European Union, too, has taken action, raising tariffs on Chinese EVs by up to about 38 per cent in July.\nBut even as protectionist walls have come up, there are signs that the tables are turning, with Europe considering using its new tariffs as leverage to induce Chinese EV makers to form joint ventures on the continent.\nProponents of greater Chinese industrial investment argue that it provides benefits for both sides, and that the US would not be able to build a competitive electric vehicle industry without involving the world leader in EVs.\n\"I want the jobs, bring the capital, bring the know-how, and we have to trust American ingenuity to be able to absorb that and run with it,\" Michael Dunne, founder of the Dunne Insights consultancy, contended on The Global Lithium podcast.\nDunne, a former General Motors executive, said the US ought to take a page from China's playbook from the 1980s: encourage joint ventures to build up its auto industry.\n\"We'll own a majority share. You have minority, but you get access to our lucrative market. And over time we hope to be able to learn how you make batteries.\"\nThere's also precedent. Faced with technologically advanced Japanese cars in the 1980s, US President Ronald Reagan negotiated a \"voluntary export restraint\" with Japan, limiting Japanese auto exports to the US and encouraging Japanese carmakers to establish plants in the US.\nTrump has not spelled out the conditions he envisioned for Chinese carmakers to operate in the US. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nBut if Trump sought to encourage such investment, analysts said, he might not need the support of Republican lawmakers. And compared to his Democratic counterparts, they say, the former president is less vulnerable to being seen as weak on China, giving him more flexibility to invite Chinese firms in.\n\"Trump can do a lot to influence his party on this type of policy because he doesn't need Congress to approve foreign direct investment,\" said Jack Zhang, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Kansas, adding that foreign auto plants have previously found receptive audiences in red states for the jobs they bring.\nChinese carmakers, for their part, have stayed mostly quiet and are taking a wait-and-see approach. BYD, for example, operates an electric bus plant in California but has not announced plans to make or sell its cars in the US. It did not respond to a request for comment.\nA worker departing a workshop at BYD's manufacturing plant in Lancaster, California. Photo: Xinhua alt=A worker departing a workshop at BYD's manufacturing plant in Lancaster, California. Photo: Xinhua>\nChinese carmakers regard the Biden tariffs as reflective of a broader resistance to Chinese participation in value chains, said Cory Combs, associate director at Trivium China, a Beijing-based consultancy. Even so, they are unlikely to rule out the US market in the foreseeable future.\nAccording to Combs, unlike US corporations, Chinese companies don't have to be as responsive to stakeholders and have more room to make medium-to-long term plans. \"They're waiting for the market to rationalise,\" he said.\n\"I would much rather be Gotion than another company in five years trying to expand battery production in the US.\"\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "date": "2024-11-21T00:25:49.000Z",
        "article_content": "Doug Bauer, chief executive of publicly traded homebuilder Tri Pointe Homes, expects “a pretty robust spring selling season” after what feels like two years of depressed existing home sales—and, more recently, hesitation among buyers and sellers amid mortgage rate volatility before the presidential election.\nIn an interview with CNBC yesterday, Bauer explained that the demand for homes is there. Everyone wants a place to live, after all; the issue is supply. The incoming administration could mean good things for the housing world, in his mind: from corporate taxes, to regulation, to mass deportation. Still, a lot of what hampers building comes from land-use control at the state and local level, particularly in high cost-of-living states such as California.\nThere are a lot of unknowns, Bauer explained—and yet there is one thing we can expect, and that has to do with the corporate tax rate. “The corporate tax rate is going to remain flat, or go down,” he said. “So, that’s a positive.”\nThen there’s regulation. Republicans and deregulation are almost always inseparable, so another Donald Trump presidency could give rise to those leanings. Specifically, Bauer thinks there’ll be reform among multiple governmental agencies, from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to those catering to energy and the environment. It is possible that reform, via a loosening regulatory environment, might actually be banked on as a product of the first-ever Department of Government Efficiency—run by none other than the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\nBauer said that “the financial markets and the banks are going to deal with a lot less regulation. The economic windfall from that, as you see, the banks are more encouraged to put dollars into all businesses, especially the land and land development business, to small, medium-sized builders.”\nWhile public builders don’t have much of an issue with financing, he said, “opening the financial spigot will help the industry as a whole.” Plus, we might see more mergers and acquisitions, which some say can be beneficial for real estate companies.\nEither way, it isn’t only Bauer and Tri Pointe Homes that appear to have a rosier outlook for next year, whether it has to do with another Trump presidency or not. UWM Holdings, parent company of United Wholesale Mortgage, announced in its third-quarter results that it was positioning for a refinance boom. The company’s refinance volume rose in the quarter to $13.3 billion, up from $6.5 billion in the previous quarter, portending an upswing in momentum in the refinance market, even with higher interest rates on the table. Chairman and chief executive Mat Ishbia was bullish on the results and said the firm was poised to capitalize on a refinance surge when it “inevitably” arrives.\n“Right now, UWM is so much better positioned than we were prior to the last refinance boom,” said Ishbia in a statement. “Simply put, our operational fitness is at an all-time high, and you'll only see us accelerate from here.”\nThen there’s $27 billion Rocket Companies, which operates Rocket Mortgage, Rocket Loans, and Rocket Homes, which has a goal of increasing its refinance market share from 12% to 20% in 2027, the company announced this month. The company’s home equity loan volume rose 78% year over year, too; it offers home equity loans as an alternate route to refinancing.\nNot to mention, Rocket’s chief executive officer Varun Krishna explained during the company’s most recent earnings call that it had identified “growth audiences” that could reshape the homebuying landscape: women heads of households, Hispanic buyers, and aging first-time buyers. “The economic influence of women will continue to surge, with women managing two-thirds of household wealth,” Krishna said, according to a transcript. “Our brand will evolve to meet these clients exactly where they are.”\nTo that end, the company reportedly purchased a new domain, Rocket.com, for $14 million. Krishna said during the call that it would “unveil the new Rocket brand identity” in February 2025. The company reportedly will also return to the Super Bowl in 2025. “The transformation began with our recent acquisition of Rocket.com, a site that will unify the homeownership experience across home search and mortgage,” said Krishna. “In the coming months, we will share a greater ambition with the country and establish a brand that represents the ability for our clients to own the elusive American Dream once more.”\nBut there is the matter of tariffs—Trump tariffs, really. When asked, Bauer said he thinks it is possible that tax cuts put in place before tariffs could actually offset any increase in prices for businesses and their margins. “I think there’s going to be a positive business and economic effect from this incoming administration,” he said.\nTrump promised to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants while on the campaign trail, and as President-elect he confirmed he would declare a national emergency to do just that. There has been some concern as to the effect this would have on labor supply, and therefore the cost to build homes, and so forth. Baur again said there are a lot of unknowns, but he doesn’t seem to be anticipating a hit.\n“I frankly think we really don't know the overall effect, and is it going to be focused more on criminals… I mean, whatever is done, I think it will be done lawfully,” he said. “As a larger builder, we’ve had no issues with the labor side of the equation this year. And frankly, as you look back on the Trump years, we had no issue with labor. So I think on the margin, it’s not going to be a big deal.”\nTri Pointe’s stock is up almost 173% in the past five years and 40% in the past year. Unlike the rest of the housing world, builders were mostly resilient; they offered mortgage-rate buydowns, cut prices, and even built smaller homes to counter the soaring rates, sky-high prices, and short supply that’s defined the market for some time—and could continue to.\nNov. 20, 2024: Due to an editing error, the story misstated Varun Krishna's title. He is the chief executive officer of Rocket Companies. The article has also been corrected to reflect Rocket Companies' goal of increasing its market share by 2027.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "title": "Trump says he would fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Day One. It’s not that easy",
        "date": "2024-08-06T14:51:22.000Z",
        "article_content": "At the recent Bitcoin 2024 conference, former President Donald Trump made headlines with his promises to \"make Bitcoin great again\" by ensuring the federal government HODLs bitcoin and fires Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler on day one. The crowd lapped it up. The reality, though, is that politicians often make sweeping promises to secure campaign contributions and votes—but, when it comes to firing Gensler on day one, that's a promise that Trump cannot keep.\nHere's why. While many in the blockchain world would find it deeply satisfying to see the crypto-hating Gensler tossed from his job on Trump's first day in office, there are a series of obstacles that make that impossible.\nFor starters, the SEC is an independent federal agency, and its commissioners, including the chair, enjoy certain protections from arbitrary removal to maintain the agency's independence from political influence. Therefore, the President does not have the authority to remove the SEC chair without cause. This protection ensures that the regulatory actions and decisions of the SEC are based on law and policy considerations rather than political pressures.\nIf you want to get into the legal weeds, there are both acts of Congress and legal rulings setting all this out—notably the landmark 1935 Supreme Court case Humphrey's Executor v. United States that limit the President's ability to remove commissioners of independent agencies without cause.\nThere are also political considerations. While the President appoints the SEC chair with the advice and consent of the Senate, removal typically does not require Senate approval. Nonetheless, Congress would likely regard any move by Trump to abruptly throw Gensler out on his ear as a dangerous precedent and push back strongly.\nThis doesn't mean, of course, that there is no way for the President to remove an agency head like Gensler if there are legitimate reasons to do so. The catch is that there is a specific process for firing an official \"for cause\"—and that process entails more than Trump, as he did during the time of his reality TV show The Apprentice, simply bellowing \"You're fired!\"\nFirst, the President must justify the decision to remove an agency official on the basis of something like inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. If Trump can point to such behavior, this would be the first step in giving Gensler the boot—otherwise, the SEC chair could ask a federal judge to reinstate him under the process known as judicial review.\nThat said, there is no shortage of people making the case that Gensler is not doing his job and that there are legitimate grounds to fire him. These include not only notable crypto industry figures but senior politicians. Senator Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), for instance, has repeatedly called for Gensler to resign in part due to the SEC's legal struggles, such as its big setback in the Ripple case, as well as the decision by a federal judge in Utah to sanction the agency's lawyers for lying to the court in a crypto case.\nIf such behavior does meet the standards to remove Gensler \"for cause,\" then Trump could indeed go about seeking to remove him on his first day. But the process for removal is not something that can happen in a single day. Here is the sequence of steps set out by law, and how a push to remove Gensler would play out:\nInitial intent and announcement (1 day): The President announces the intention to remove Gary Gensler.\nEstablishing cause (1–3 months): An investigation is conducted to gather evidence of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\nProviding notice and opportunity to respond (2–3 weeks): Formal notice is given to Gensler, who is then provided with a period to respond.\nReview and decision (1–2 months): An internal review and potentially a hearing are conducted, leading to a decision on the removal.\nLegal challenges and judicial review (6–18 months): If contested, the case goes through the judicial system, potentially reaching higher courts.\nAdministrative transition (immediate to 1 month): An interim chair is appointed, and the transition is managed.\nBottom line? The removal process could outlast a commissioner's five-year term. Although the idea of immediately ousting the SEC chair might appeal to some voters, the reality is far more intricate and prolonged. Legal safeguards and due process are in place to ensure that the SEC's regulatory actions remain unbiased and grounded in legal and policy considerations, shielding them from undue political influence. Therefore, unless there's a resignation on day one, a Gensler departure will be anything but swift.\nTonya M.

        "date": "2024-11-21T01:11:53.000Z",
        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz to run Medicare and Medicaid, the massive government programs providing health care to 150 million Americans. What could that mean if you’re on Medicare or will enroll in coming years?\nWhile no one knows for sure, and Oz would need Senate confirmation to become the 19th Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), it’s possible to read the tea leaves based on what we’ve heard from him, Trump, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—Oz’s boss if confirmed by the Senate to run the Department of Health and Human Services.\nTrump and Oz have been friends for 20 years and Oz served on Trump’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition in his first term.\nIn a statement nominating America’s most famous TV doctor talk-show host to work with Kennedy and “take on the illness industrial complex,” Trump wrote: “There may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again.”\nBut, STAT News reporter Lev Facher told PBS, Kennedy and Oz “are about as outside the mainstream as you could conceive of for picks to run the Health department and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.”\nSpeaking at the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) conference in Seattle last week before Trump selected Oz, Andrew MacPherson, managing partner of the nonpartisan health care consulting firm Healthsperien, said: “With the Trump administration, federal health insurance programs will be under extraordinary scrutiny.”\nDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump said “he will not cut one penny from Medicare.” The 2024 GOP platform language said Republicans would “protect Medicare and ensure Seniors receive the care they need without being burdened by excessive costs.”\nBut that doesn’t mean Medicare won’t change during Trump’s second term.\nAs you might expect, some Republicans in Congress have heartily endorsed Oz and some Democrats have said he shouldn’t get the CMS post.\nHere’s a rundown on what you might expect from Dr. Oz (who lost his bid to be a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania in 2022) if he runs Medicare, Medicaid and management of the Affordable Care Act at the 6,000-person CMS, as well as what’s impossible to know:\nMedicare beneficiaries can choose between Traditional Medicare (Parts A and B, also called Original Medicare) and private insurers’ Medicare Advantage plans (Part C). Currently, 54% are in Medicare Advantage plans.\nMedicare experts expect Oz and the President will push those plans, favoring them over Traditional Medicare.\nOz has a history of endorsing Medicare Advantage. When he ran for Senate and AARP asked how he would strengthen Medicare, Oz said: “We can expand Medicare Advantage plans. These plans are popular among seniors, consistently provide quality care and have a needed incentive to keep costs low.”\nOn an episode of The Dr. Oz show, he and a Medicare Advantage agent talked up purchasing a policy. “Millions are doing it; so can you,” Oz said.\nTrump and Oz might try to make Medicare Advantage plans the default choice for Medicare beneficiaries, as the Project 2025 report recommended.\n“I think there will be a conversation around that,” MacPherson said.\nUnclear, however, is whether Oz would halt the scheduled 2026 rule requiring Medicare Advantage plans to provide members with prior authorization results quickly.\nBob Blancato, an elder advocate, said at the GSA conference: “We need to keep an eye on Medicare Advantage, the partial privatization of Medicare.”\nIn 2020, Oz co-wrote an article calling for a Medicare Advantage for All system they dubbed “Medical Advantage.”\nIt would mean every American except for those on Medicaid (the state-federal health program for low-income Americans) would sign up to buy government-run health insurance sold by insurance companies—not just people 65 and older.\nThis new Medicare Advantage program would be funded through a 20% payroll tax, half paid by employers and half by employees. The policies would have a $1,000 annual deductible. Traditional Medicare in 2025 has a $257 Part B deductible and a $1,676 Part A deductible for in-patient hospital services.\nThe Medical Advantage coverage, Oz said, would be much better than what’s currently available to most people.\nWhen Trump made his CMS nomination announcement, he said Oz “will also cut waste and fraud within our Country’s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of the Nation’s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget.”\nThere seems to be plenty of waste, and possibly fraud, for Oz to try eliminating from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAn April 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) said the two programs “are susceptible to payment errors—over $100 billion in 2023.” These “improper payments” were either incorrect amounts or shouldn’t have been made at all, the GAO said.\nMedicare spent $1.0 trillion in 2023 to provide health care services for roughly 66 million Americans; Medicaid accounted for $849 billion in federal and state spending to about 90 million people.\nIf Oz and Trump can cut waste and fraud in a dramatic way, that could help keep Medicare afloat.\nThe program’s Hospital Trust Fund is expected to have serious solvency problems in 2036, which worries Americans. In a recent NerdWallet survey, 74% of respondents with Medicare said they were concerned about their benefits being reduced in their lifetime.\nThe 2024 Republican platform said the part would “strengthen Medicare for future generations,” but didn’t say how.\nThe Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act lowered to $2,000 Medicare beneficiaries’ maximum annual out-of-pocket cost for prescription drugs covered by their plans and experts think Oz won’t try to raise that cap.\nAlthough Project 2025 called for the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, “nobody’s going to mess with the $2,000 cap,” said Blancato at the GSA conference before Oz was nominated.\nOz and Trump have said they want to make prescription drugs more affordable. While running for Senate, Oz told AARP: “Cumbersome regulations in Washington worsen high prescription drug costs. We can accelerate clinical studies on newly developed drugs to reduce wasted time and money on ineffective products. This will also improve efficiency, so life-improving medications can reach seniors earlier and at reduced prices.”\nBut it’s unclear whether Oz and Trump would continue or expand the Inflation Reduction Act’s program letting Medicare negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies.\n“Trump has talked about negotiating drug prices. Maybe he’ll change the number of drugs that can be negotiated, but he won’t repeal this,” Blancato said.\nAs part of his CMS job, Oz will oversee the nation’s nursing homes. Some think he may eliminate the new federal nursing-home staffing standards the Biden administration initiated, allowing nursing home operators to make their own staffing choices.\nMedicaid provides, among other things, long-term care coverage for people in the program. Experts believe Oz and Trump will look for ways to cut the cost of Medicaid.\nThis could be done by changing the rules on who qualifies for benefits (such as instituting a work requirement to receive them) or moving Medicaid funding to local block grants.\nWhile Oz and Trump aren’t expected to abolish the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Oz has called it “half-good,” experts expect changes to the program.\n“The ACA won’t be repealed and replaced, but the Trump administration will chip away at aspects they don’t like, such as the premium subsidies that expire at the end of 2025,” said MacPherson.\nSaid Blancato: “Those subsidies are used by 20 million people. If they go after the subsidies, that could mean a 79% premium increase.”\nThere are two areas of Medicare coverage where it’s impossible to know what Oz might do because Congress and the Biden administration need to make decisions about them by year’s end.\nThe first is whether to continue allowing Medicare coverage nationwide for telehealth visits with doctors. This coverage is due to expire December 31 unless Congress and Biden extend it.\nThe second is whether Medicare will keep covering hospital at home; this coverage will end December 31, too, unless Congress and the president push back that date.\nMore on Medicare\n3 big changes coming to Medicare in 2025.

        "article_content": "The stock market's feverish rally following Donald Trump's presidential election victory may have just been an early appetizer for a strong few months of gains.\n\"Exuberance lies ahead,\" Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. \"President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response.\"\nEmanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A \"public reengaged in speculation,\" as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel.\nMarket tops are often hallmarked by \"exuberance,\" Emanuel wrote. But with subdued activity in the IPO market and a lack of meme-like action in stocks where equities are surging without the fundamentals to back them, the true signs of an overstretched market rally aren't flashing red.\nEmanuel admits when considering the S&P 500 is selling at more than 24 times the past 12 months' earnings, stocks look expensive from a valuation perspective. But as strategists often point out, high valuations aren't typically a great market-timing tool.\n\"Expensive has a history of getting more expensive and lasting longer with greater gains,\" Emanuel wrote. \"This market will be driven higher by the policy prospect of deregulation in DC driving a capital market cycle largely absent since the [October 2022] trough.\"\nAdditionally, Emanuel cites the history of a bull markets. The current bull market is 25 months old and boasts a return of 65%. This is well short of the average 50-month-long bull market that returns 152%.\nThe case for stocks to run higher is also supported by the Fed's cutting cycle, Emanuel argues. Since the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the 10-year Treasury yield has soared about 80 basis points to about 4.42%.\nTypically, this would be considered a headwind for stocks. Instead, the S&P 500 has risen more than 5%. Emanuel points out the only other time this happened during a Fed rate-cutting cycle was the 1995 \"soft landing,\" where the economy remained on solid footing and \"the start of a glorious stock market epoch\" began, per Emanuel.\nIn a client note on Tuesday night, Stifel chief equity strategist Barry Bannister offered similar sentiment to Emanuel, writing that the\" S&P 500 has entered a mania.\" Bannister, who's been bearish on stocks amid the rally, admits the index could keep pushing higher to the low 6,000s in the coming months. This would come as the S&P 500 reaches an 80-year-high valuation, Bannister wrote. But he also still sees a downside scenario where the index falls from those levels to 5,250 a year later.\nThe key risk is a resurgence in inflation that prompts the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer than markets are currently expecting.\n\"If inflation proves resurgent ... we suspect Chairman Powell’s last 12 months in office (May 2025 to May 2026) are a significant investor risk,\" Bannister wrote.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Donald Trump recently said he would not sell his stock in Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT). But, starting Thursday, he will have that option — something that's not been available since the social media company went public in March.\n“I have absolutely no intention of selling,” the former president told reporters at a press conference last week. “I love it. I use it as a method of getting out my word.”\nDJT shares surged by double digits on Friday following his revelation, although the stock has recently given up those gains, falling more than 10% over the past six days to close below $14.50 on Thursday — near the low-end of its 52-week range and far off its record high of just over $79 a share.\nStakeholders, including the former president, are subject to a six-month lockup period before selling or transferring shares. That lockup period will expire on Thursday, although Trump was still able to pocket some cash in late April when the stock hit a milestone that secured him an additional $1.2 billion.\nAs Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul detailed, the purpose of a lock-up period is to protect a newly public company's interests and allow it to preserve stability before its founders can cash out.\n“If I sell, it wouldn’t be the same, and I can understand that,” Trump said on Friday, adding that he knows his stake has been \"whittled down\" in recent months.\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $3.3 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $2 billion. Right after the company's public debut, Trump's stake was worth just over $4.5 billion.\nTrump Media went public on the Nasdaq in late March after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. But the stock has been on a bumpy ride since, with shares oscillating between highs and lows as the moves have typically been tied to a volatile news cycle.\nIn June, the stock popped (then fell) after current commander in chief Joe Biden stumbled in his first presidential debate of 2024 with Trump. Biden dropped out of the presidential race one month later.\nSince Biden's announcement, shares have remained under pressure as Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, tracks ahead of Trump in the latest polling. Most recently, the stock plummeted to new lows following last week's debate as bets on a Harris presidency increased.\nIn May, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records intended to influence the 2016 presidential campaign — a verdict that sent shares down 5% the day after the conviction. His sentencing was recently delayed until Nov. 26.\nShares have fallen about 60% since the company's public debut at the end of March.\nTrump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, the platform now known as X, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in 2021. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus.\nBut as Truth Social attempts to take on the social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question.\nLast month, DJT reported second quarter results that revealed a net loss of $16.4 million, about half of which was tied to expenses related to the company's SPAC deal. The company also reported revenue of just under $837,000 for the quarter ending June 30, a 30% year over year drop.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closed more than 4% higher Monday after surging 15% on Friday following news that Donald Trump would not sell his shares in the company.\nTrump, who made the announcement on his Truth Social account Friday afternoon, maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, the parent company of Truth Social.\nAt Monday's closing level of around $33 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $7.2 billion, giving the president-elect a stake worth over $4.3 billion.\nShares in the company have been on a wild ride since Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election, oscillating between highs and lows.\nIn September, shares in Trump Media traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. The stock eventually bounced back from its lows as both domestic and overseas betting markets began to shift in favor of a Trump victory.\nAccording to analytics company S3 Partners, DJT short sellers, or traders who bet the stock's price will fall, are down $22.2 million in mark-to-market losses since Nov. 4.\n\"Although we had been seeing increased short selling in DJT stock ahead of the election, we have been seeing short covering since the election with 1.26 million shares, worth $392 million, bought to cover since Nov. 4,\" S3 Partners head of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky told Yahoo Finance.\n\"We expect continued short covering in DJT stock if the rally continues and heads back towards its recent $51.51 high, the ensuing short squeeze which will force out many of the 1.7 million shares we saw shorted over the last month ahead of the election,\" Dusaniwsky added.\nTrump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.

This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period.\nDJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023.

        "date": "2024-11-13T20:00:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "The technology industry will face serious questions about some of its biggest issues when Donald Trump takes office in January.\nThe president-elect will have a say on a range of topics including AI and antitrust regulation, as well as the future of the CHIPS Act — and all of it will have huge implications for Big Tech’s future.\nTrump hasn’t had the best relationship with the tech industry over the years. He’s sparred with Amazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos over stories published by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, about Trump during his first term. Trump also threatened to jail Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of plotting against him in the 2020 election — and says he personally reached out to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai because he didn’t see enough positive stories about him in his Google Search results.\nBut Trump also has high-powered backers in tech, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey, and Andreessen Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who donated millions to a pro-Trump super-PAC.\nNow, Trump is coming into office with a Republican majority in the Senate and an expected majority in the House of Representatives, giving him extraordinary power to enact his agenda. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the tech industry is headed for a difficult four years. In fact, Trump’s second term in the White House could benefit some of tech’s major players.\nThe Biden administration set out to corral Big Tech’s outsized market power by launching a slew of antitrust suits against Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple (AAPL). The Federal Trade Commission, helmed by Lina Khan, also refiled a suit against Meta that was originally brought under the Trump administration that claims the social network operates as an illegal monopoly.\nBut a second Trump administration may be less aggressive on antitrust regulation. During an interview with Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait, for example, Trump said that rather than breaking up Google, which the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has floated as a possibility, he would make changes to make the business “more fair.”\nIt doesn’t hurt that, according to the New York Times, tech CEOs reached out to Trump in the lead-up to the election, with Pichai praising the president-elect’s stop at a McDonald’s during the campaign and Bezos calling Trump after surviving his first assassination attempt in July. Bezos and Pichai were also among the major tech leaders who congratulated Trump on his election win last week.\n“The fact that he has the support of a lot of these tech titans is emblematic of a sense that they think he's warmer to tech, but also less concerned about trying to quote 'break up Big Tech' on the antitrust side,” explained director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, Sarah Kreps.\nGenerative AI didn’t take the world by storm until well after Trump’s first term was over. As he enters his second term, the technology is all Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, want to talk about. But tech companies are also interested in hammering down some kind of AI regulation.\nRegulation takes the onus off of Big Tech to make important decisions about how they operate their services while ensuring there’s a single piece of legislation that governs the use of AI across the country, rather than a state-by-state patchwork of rules.\nThe Biden Administration attempted to implement AI regulation through an executive order seeking to allow for the development of new AI technologies while protecting against potential misuses. But Trump’s penchant for deregulation could dismantle Biden’s executive order in favor of a more laissez-faire approach.\nHowever, a lack of regulation in AI could be problematic down the line.\n“We've seen when that happens,” explained Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College professor Ari Lightman. “When that occurs and sort of guardrails are taken off, we have a lot of societal implications associated with it. A lot of harms that get perpetrated, and a lot of people become very, very rich.”\nTrump surrogate Musk has repeatedly raised the specter of unchecked AI development, and as the head of xAI, it would make sense for Musk to appeal to Trump for some kind of rules around AI. Of course, it wouldn’t hurt Musk if those rules were relatively malleable.\nThe second Trump administration will also have plenty of input when it comes to the fate of the CHIPS Act. A hallmark piece of legislation under the Biden Administration, the CHIPS Act is designed to provide funding to semiconductor designers and manufacturers in an attempt to bring chip building back to the US.\nBut Trump has signaled his displeasure with the $52.7 billion legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans would likely repeal the act, before walking the statement back earlier this month.\nWhile it’s unlikely that the CHIPS Act will be repealed, Trump could seek to push the funding out to companies faster while cutting down on red tape around the development of manufacturing facilities.\n“The CHIPS Act is extremely unlikely to be repealed. There is bipartisan support for industrial policy, especially for chips,” Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon told Yahoo Finance.\nBut during an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump derided the CHIPS Act and said that he preferred to instead put tariffs on chips from overseas as a way to force companies to build chip plants in the US.\nTariffs would mean companies importing chips from overseas, whether from Taiwan or China, would have to raise prices on devices that include those semiconductors. And that could hurt the entire tech industry.\n“Hardware businesses are going to be impacted because some part of their supply chain exists in China,” explained Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie.\n“So whether we're talking about computers or hard drives or telecommunications equipment, there's some piece of every part of a supply chain that has either assembly or manufacturing in the Chinese state.”\nThat could mean higher prices on everything from consumer goods like PCs and smartphones to AI chips for high-powered enterprise servers. Now we just have to wait until Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 before we can find out the full impact of his proposals on the tech industry.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Internet forums and analyst reports are abuzz with discussions on what stocks can skyrocket in the years to come.\nLast month, someone with $200,000 in an inherited IRA asked for ‘Trump-friendly' stock recommendations on r/Investing – a discussion board on Reddit with 2.6 million members. The questioner wanted to put $100,000 in individual stocks of the total inherited amount.\nDon't Miss:\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.\n\"Looking to put about half in a Trump-Friendly portfolio.

The inherited IRA account must be closed and taxes related to it must be paid within 10 years.\n\"It had been earning 5% up until the election, now I'm looking to ride the Trump train and with an aggressive portfolio I believe a fair expectation/hope is to get this $200k to $500k by the end of Trump's four years,\" he added.\nWhile the Redditor asked the r/investing community for suggestions, he had a few ideas for which he sought constructive criticism and feedback.\nFirst, let's examine the recommendations he received from other Redditors and then see what stocks he was considering investing in.\nTrending: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast — here’s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\nRedditors' Recommendations for the Trump Era\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\nThe Redditor looking for stock recommendations for the Trump era was suggested more than once to put his money into a broader market fund like the S&P 500 ETF (SPY).\n\"IMO, you should just put the other $100k into the S&P 500 fund too and forget about it for the next 10 years,\" a Redditor said.\nA few Redditors during the discussion said the Trump rally he was hoping to ride is already priced in the market.\n\"You already missed the massive gap up on speculative stocks for Trump win, no? your bets now would be ‘do I think the market is mispricing the things that fell/jumped on trump win,’ not just ‘what will do well,'\" a Redditor commented.\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund\nA Redditor recommended the Technology Select Sector Fund (XLK), saying technology stocks are in for a good time in the coming Trump era.\n\"Putting an end to censorship ought to be good for social media.

Israel and Palestine have endured regular conflicts with each other, including the current conflict, which started in 2023.\nElad Schaffer, co-founder and CEO of Faye Travel Insurance, suggested that Trump can reduce travel costs by bringing these conflicts to an end.\n“If Trump is successful in ending the two long wars in Europe (Russia-Ukraine) and the Middle East (Israel-Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran) as his statements suggest, this could lead to lower travel costs and an increase in overall international travel during his second term,” Schaffer said.\nNot only would more people travel internationally, but the countries currently in conflict can see heightened travel demand. Schaffer brings up travel stocks when assessing how people feel about Trump’s upcoming term and what type of impacts it could bring to the economy.\n“Judging based on public market response, key travel companies such as Expedia, Booking and United Airlines have seen their stock rise significantly (~15%) since Election Day, reflecting the positive economic outlook in the market following Trump’s victory,” he said.\n“Indeed, this isn’t specific to travel companies as the entire market has seen a noticeable uptick, but it stands to reason that if inflation continues to stabilize and unemployment remains low, we could see travel continue its incredible rise since the pandemic.”\nCheck Out: How President-Elect Trump’s Win Could Impact Grocery Prices\nWhile ending global conflicts would bring travel prices down, Trump’s tariffs can undo some of those savings for travelers.\nNick Burgess, the editor-in-chief for Trip Trend Setters, cited tariffs as a notable concern that can impact domestic and international travel.\n“President-elect Trump’s key economic policy is to levy major tariffs against key trade partners of the United States. This is a similar, albeit beefed-up, approach to what he did in his first term, which saw real purchasing power shrink among the American middle class,” Burgess explained.\n“However, the travel industry was hit particularly hard by rising costs due to tariffs from 2017 to 2019, including the costs of furnishing the rooms, which affected even basic domestic travel. Tariffs from Chinese-made products, like refrigerators, mattresses, TVs and microwaves, skyrocketed hotel costs, which were then passed onto the consumer.”\nJoe Cronin is the president of International Citizens Insurance, which helps people research, compare, and purchase insurance plans for their relocation abroad or international trips. Cronin cited Trump’s visa policies as a concern that could affect U.S. tourism.\n“Tighter visa policies during Trump’s presidency might dramatically increase travel costs and reduce ease of access for foreign visitors, potentially slowing down U.S. tourism,” Cronin said.\n“We saw President Trump implement a significant change in visa requirements, which complicated international travel and increased fees and wait times; this could persist in his second term as president.”\nCronin also mentioned how currency exchange rates became more volatile under Trump’s first term.\n“There are also instances in the past when Trump’s economic policies resulted in volatility in exchange rates impacting the cost of international travel,” he explained. “If these policies are replicated, travelers will have to encounter increased costs when moving around the world.”\nTrump’s policies tend to strengthen the U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar makes it easier for U.S. citizens to travel internationally. However, it can hamper U.S. tourism due to unfavorable exchange rates.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "A series of appearances in recent weeks have solidified a truism about former President Donald Trump: Nearly every economic challenge, from deficits to the fraying social safety net, can seemingly be solved with more oil drilling or new tariffs.\nIt will be \"so easy,\" he is fond of saying — and will also bring in waves of money.\nBut economists and other experts are skeptical on multiple fronts: Would it really be that easy? Would it bring in anywhere close to as much money as the former president thinks?\nNot to mention whether such policies might cause more problems than they solve.\nYet it hasn't slowed Trump, who at a series of events in recent weeks — from the recent debate to an economic speech to multiple rallies and press appearances — has promised that America's coffers will be overflowing if he wins in November because of these twin policies.\n\"We're gonna have so much money coming in,\" he said at a speech last week in New York on the topic of tariffs. Oil is additional \"liquid gold,\" he added Thursday during a stop in Arizona.\nTrump has in turn promised that these funds will pay for nearly all of his other ideas. Everything from lowering deficits to defeating inflation to lowering taxes to cutting prices in half, he says, will be possible, with enough left over to create a new national sovereign wealth fund.\nIn one widely noted exchange at the Economic Club of New York, Trump fielded a question on what childcare policies he'd champion but answered even that by returning again to tariff revenue.\n\"Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers we are talking about, including child care,\" Trump said in a meandering and widely criticized answer.\nThe rhetorical tack from Trump is also a way to try and wave away questions about the costs of his other ideas, from extending his 2017 tax cuts to a call for free IVF coverage to a new policy announced this week to end taxes on overtime.\nTrump also recently endorsed a government efficiency commission, to be headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, that he says will generate trillions more.\nOil drilling is the area where the GOP nominee returns perhaps the most often, promising to unleash the sector at nearly every campaign stop.\nWhat he often overlooks is that the US, under the Biden/Harris administration, is currently drilling more oil than during Trump's term. In fact, the US is currently producing more than any country in history.\nBut Trump nonetheless promises that his plan for the sector will not only bring in additional billions, it will also cut energy prices in half.\n\"We will cut it in half, and that includes your heating, air conditioning, electricity, gasoline for the cars,\" he promised an audience in Wisconsin. \"And we'll do it easily, you can hold me to it.\"\nIt's a notion that many experts have discounted — noting a variety of factors that will make such a dramatic price drop unlikely.\nWhoever the next president is could benefit from a recent trend of overall gas deflation, with gas prices currently at the lowest level since 2021.\nBut there are limits.\nTrump, if he wins, would presumably swiftly cut red tape for oil companies and open new areas for drilling. But oil companies themselves might not go along and could be skeptical of a plan that could result in a giant drop in profit margins.\n\"Even if you open up some federal lands and reduce friction costs of permitting, the economics is going to be what drives those decisions.\" CIBC Private Wealth US senior energy trader Rebecca Babin told Yahoo Finance, adding that a massive expansion is unlikely but there could be some changes on the margin.\nShe said that halving energy costs is also unlikely due to increasing supply. That is only likely to happen because of some deep demand shock.\n\"If energy prices are halved,\" she added, \"something is terribly wrong.\"\nAnd if it's not oil drilling, Trump is likely to turn to tariffs for how he'd fund his plans.\nThe former president has promised to levy duties of 10% to 20% on US trading partners and 60% on China if he is returned to the Oval Office.\n\"It will be a national economic renaissance just by using our heads, by being smart, by not letting other countries take advantage of us,\" Trump said recently.\nBut experts are skeptical on this front too, often noting that such aggressive tariffs could drive up prices and slow the economy.\nA recent note from Goldman Sachs underlined those worries, finding that — at least when it comes to the gross domestic product — a Kamala Harris win is the best outcome for economic growth in part because of a \"hit to growth from tariffs\" that Trump could bring if he wins.\nAnd that's even with the Goldman analysts projecting that Trump wouldn't be likely to implement his entire tariff agenda if he wins.\nOthers have analyzed the impact on prices, with the Peterson Institute for International Economics saying that Trump's ideas for 60% duties on China and 10% on other trading partners would lead to a typical middle-class household paying at least $1,700 more each year.\nAnother look from Brendan Duke of the left-leaning Center for American Progress projects an even higher tab of $3,900 for a typical family each year if 60% duties on China and 20% on other trading partners come into effect, a stat that has become a favorite of Kamala Harris.\n\"Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world,\" Trump maintained at this week's debate, overlooking the fact that tariffs are actually paid by companies at US ports of entry. The additional costs, economists contend, are usually passed on to consumers.\nThere are also skeptics of Trump's idea that tariffs would bring in enough money to pay for other programs. Trump raised tariffs substantially in his first term as president and President Biden has left them largely in place.\nBut tariff revenue in 2022, the most recent year available, amounted to $111.8 billion in the face of a nearly $2 trillion deficit.\nBut in any case, it's barely slowed Trump, who recently promised that his ideas could have the US with \"no deficits within a fairly short amount of time.\"\nFew expect Trump to change tack in the 50 or so days between now and Election Day, but his reliance on these twin proposals is beginning to get at least some political pushback.\nHis recent exchange on childcare, where he abruptly pivoted to tariffs, made particular waves especially when he seemed to minimize the high costs parents pay.\n\"As much as childcare is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we will be taking in,\" he said. Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani, who asked Trump the question, soon criticized Trump's response to her query as flippant at best.\n\"He told us childcare expenses are no big deal,\" she said on CNN the next day, adding, \"It's insulting to parents.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has long been an advocate of tariffs, having implemented several during his time in the Oval Office. If elected again, he’s made it clear that tariffs will remain a key part of his economic strategy — this time, with even steeper rates.\nSpeaking at the Economic Club of Chicago, Trump expressed his continued enthusiasm for tariffs, calling it \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" and even joking, “It needs a public relations firm.” His remark drew applause from the audience.\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\nNervous about November? Use these 3 ‘shockproof assets’ to protect your retirement nest egg in 2025 — no matter who takes the White Houses\nProtect your retirement savings with these 5 essential money moves — most of which you can complete in just minutes\nTrump believes tariffs are the key to boosting U.S. manufacturing by pressuring companies to relocate their production to American soil.\n“The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States so it doesn’t have to pay the tariff,” he explained, earning another round of applause.\nBeyond avoiding tariffs, Trump offered an additional incentive: tax cuts for companies that manufacture domestically.\n“We're going to lower taxes still further for companies that are going to make their product in the USA,” he stated.\nTrump has proposed reducing the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 15%. This sharp contrast with Vice President Kamala Harris’s plan to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% highlights a major policy divide between the two candidates.\nTrump specifically targeted the automotive industry as an example of how he plans to use tariffs if elected, pointing to what he sees as a growing threat from China’s investments in Mexico.\n“Mexico is a tremendous challenge for us right now, tremendous. China is building massive auto plants in Mexico, and they’re going to build them, and they’re going to take those cars and sell them into the United States,” he warned, highlighting Mexico’s close proximity to the U.S.\nAccording to Trump, this poses serious risks to the U.S. auto industry. “That’s going to be the end of Michigan, it’s going to be the end of, frankly, South Carolina, going to be the end of everything,” he stated, suggesting that entire regions of the country could be devastated if these imports aren’t stopped.\nTo counter this, Trump proposed using heavy tariffs. “If I'm going to be president of this country, I'm going to put a 100, 200, 2,000% tariff,” he declared. “They're not going to sell one car into the United States, because we're not going to destroy our country.”\nTrump outlined two key purposes for tariffs. The first is to generate government revenue, arguing that even a 10% tariff could help reduce the budget deficit. The second is to force companies to relocate their production to the U.S. However, Trump emphasized that a low tariff, like 10%, wouldn’t be enough to drive such a move.\n“They're not going to do it for 10[%], but [if] you make a 50% tariff, they're going to come in,” he said.\nRead more: The average American family spends $23,968/year for health insurance — just 3 minutes can help you nail down less expensive coverage\nWhile Trump strongly advocates for the benefits of tariffs on the U.S. economy, many hold differing views.\nEconomists generally view tariffs as a double-edged sword. On one hand, they can protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive, giving local manufacturers a competitive edge. On the other hand, higher tariffs may result in increased costs for consumers, as companies pass on the extra expenses. This can lead to inflation, eroding household purchasing power and raising the cost of living.\nTrump’s opponent Harris has been vocal about these downsides. She has described Trump’s tariff proposals as “a sales tax on the American people,” claiming they would “raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year.”\nA 2019 study by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University and Columbia University analyzed the effects of Trump’s tariffs through late 2018. Their findings were clear: “Our results imply that the tariff revenue the U.S. is now collecting is insufficient to compensate the losses being borne by the consumers of imports.”\nTariffs can also spark retaliation from trading partners, leading to trade wars that disrupt global supply chains and hinder economic growth.\nIan Sheldon, a professor and the Andersons Chair of Agricultural Marketing, Trade and Policy at Ohio State University, underscored this risk during a conversation with Business Insider: “We have this integrated market in North America, and we're already in a trade dispute with Mexico over genetically modified corn. It seems counterproductive to me to potentially exacerbate trade relations with one of our large trading partners. It doesn't make any sense to me.”\nDavid Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, also warned of severe economic fallout from Trump’s tariff strategy.\n“It’s one of those magical economic proposals that can actually cause inflation and put you into a recession — at the same time,” Kelly told CNN. “It’s a two-year-old’s mentality: You punch someone in the nose and expect them not to punch you back.”\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do?

        "article_content": "Donald Trump has made new tariffs a centerpiece of his potential second-term economic agenda, and he could try to force them into existence much more rapidly than many might be expecting.\nHis allies are exploring an array of legally untested and potentially disruptive options that experts say could prove to be a second destabilizing force for global markets on top of the duties themselves.\nWhat the former president wants to do \"quickly\" is push up tariff levels to heights not seen in recent history. He could spur new inflation with plans to implement up to 60% duties on many Chinese goods and 10% levels on other major trading partners.\n\"It may be more than that,\" Trump added on how high things could go in a recent interview with Time.\nWhether he actually tries to implement duties that high and how long it takes before companies start paying them at US ports of entry may come down to how aggressively Trump seeks to act among his other possible priorities if he wins.\nTrump's history with the issue suggests he could try to be bold.\n\"If he's looking for an immediate jolt, ... it could be this,\" noted William Reinsch. The longtime trade policymaker added in a recent interview that tariffs have long been appealing to Trump as an area uniquely open to unilateral action.\n\"Plus, he's got a thing about trade, he always has,\" Reinsch added, who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nIt is Congress that formally — per the US Constitution — has the power to \"lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.\" But lawmakers have ceded much of that power to the Oval Office in a series of bills that stretch back decades.\nThat history gives a potentially victorious Trump a wide array of options.\nPerhaps the most rapid route is an authority granted to the president under a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to declare an economic emergency and act accordingly.\nIf Trump were to go that route, Reinsch said, he could act quickly, but \"he would almost certainly be sued by somebody.\"\nIn that scenario, the key question is likely to become whether a judge would be inclined to issue an injunction to stop the tariffs or let them go into effect while the court case plays out.\nA second potential quick strike option is Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930.\nTwo lawyers at Covington & Burling LLP highlighted this \"long forgotten\" presidential power in 2016, noting that it grants the president \"substantial albeit qualified powers\" to impose tariffs on countries the White House feels have discriminated against the US.\nWhat is notable is that both options have already been discussed in Trump's circles.\nRobert Lighthizer was Trump's trade representative last time around and appears to be in line for another top job if Trump wins. He cited both of these authorities in a recent New York Times interview, saying Trump would have \"clear authority\" under those two laws due to the size of the trade deficit.\nAnother recent essay from Peter Navarro, the former director of Trump's Trade Council, argued that tariffs should be viewed as a national security issue and that all authorities available should be used to \"increase tariff levels that will block out 'Made in China' products.\"\nNavarro may be unlikely to be involved in a second Trump administration as he is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress, but the essay was included in a potentially influential recent book that aims to be a \"comprehensive policy guide\" for Trump or for the next conservative administration.\nMegan Hogan is a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has spent recent months studying Trump's potential trade options.\nShe noted that the broad powers in these laws are tempting because they could be enacted quickly and also because they could allow Trump to implement higher tariff levels.\n\"I think the reason why he's trying these other laws is because his new trade agenda this time around is much more ambitious,\" she said, drawing a comparison with 2016. Other options entail limitations on the size of duties a president can impose and other restrictions.\nHogan also mentioned yet another untested presidential power to watch if Trump wins: the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917.\nThat law was focused on intellectual property after World War I but is still in force and something a second Trump White House could seize on as an authority.\nThere are other options that Trump could also use. These more familiar presidential authorities are ones that both Trump and President Biden have invoked in recent years, but they can take months to play out.\nOne option is national security tariff authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. There's also Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which gives the president the power to levy tariffs for a wider array of reasons.\nThe specifics of those two options differ, but both require more formal investigations by the Department of Commerce before the duties can go into place.\nIn his own recent move to call for a potential tripling of steel tariffs on China, Biden leaned primarily on Section 301 authority but cited Section 232 authority as well.\nTrump's China tariffs were also enacted under Section 301 authority, with an investigation beginning in August 2017 and concluding over a year into his presidency in March 2018.\nLikewise, Trump's 2018 plan for a 25% tariff on imported steel came under Section 232 authority and took months and months before coming into force.\nThe slowest option — but one that could be most immune to lawsuits — would be for Trump to formally consult Congress.\nLighthizer has floated this as an option, but Trump's approach to trade has long spurred opposition from lawmakers in both parties.\nAnother question hanging in the air is whether Congress might look to step in to claw back some of its authority if Trump wins.\nRep. Don Beyer, a Democrat of Virginia, is not a fan of Trump's approach to trade and has long pushed an effort to rein in some of the president's unilateral tariff authority.\nHe acknowledged in an interview that much of the political will for his effort among Democrats has \"diminished\" in recent years and, from his perspective, \"we are definitely in the trade doldrums.\"\nNonetheless, Capitol Hill is populated by tariff-skeptical lawmakers from both parties. Republicans helped mount an ultimately unsuccessful effort during Trump's last term to roll back some of the president's authority around Section 232 tariffs.\n\"Reforming Section 232 is not about President Trump,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican, said at the time. \"Congress has been too negligent in the past of protecting our constitutional responsibility.\"\nThe current effort from Rep. Beyer has seen little progress in recent years and, for the moment, is only focused on Section 232 tariffs and not the wider suite of presidential trade authorities.\nThis is, as Beyer put it, to be \"on the realistic side,\" but he remains hopeful that Congress could look to act in the coming years even if there is currently little to no chance of Congress addressing the issue before November's election.\nHe noted that a Trump win could be \"very motivating to have Congress do our best to assert our rightful authority.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "Kevin O'Leary, known for his straightforward attitude on Shark Tank, recently stated that you don't have to love Donald Trump to appreciate his policies. In a recent appearance on Fox Business, O'Leary praised the president-elect’s pro-business strategies, saying they are exactly what America needs to boost the economy and create jobs.\nO'Leary is working on a massive project in Alberta, Canada – supposedly the world's largest AI data center. However, his attention is equally focused on the U.S., where he believes Trump's policies could fast-track similar ventures. Trump recently promised expedited permits for large infrastructure projects, something O'Leary says would be a game-changer.\nDon't Miss:\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones.

By cutting red tape, Trump's plan could open the floodgates for investment, particularly in the energy and tech sectors, per O’Leary.\nThe AI data center he is building in Canada will rely on natural gas turbines for power, an interim solution until nuclear energy becomes more viable. He is also exploring similar projects in West Virginia and North Dakota but says U.S. permitting delays are a major hurdle.\nAccording to O'Leary, Trump's promise to simplify the permitting process is exactly what is needed to turn these ideas into reality.\nTrending: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started.\nO'Leary also believes that policies promoting infrastructure and energy projects will create significant jobs. \"This is what we need,\" he said. \"You can still hate Trump, but you've got to love his policies because that will bring jobs to these states.\"\nO'Leary argues that these initiatives can breathe new life into local economies by cutting through bureaucracy and encouraging private investment. He is particularly optimistic about how such policies can attract capital, boost industries and ultimately create long-term stability.\nCritics fear that cutting corners on permits could result in problems for the environment and public safety. Some contend that these rules prioritize corporations over regular citizens.

        "date": "2024-09-21T09:59:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Credit card debt has been a pressing issue in America, and former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has proposed a solution to alleviate this burden.\n“While working Americans catch up, we’re going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates,” Trump spoke to a packed audience during a campaign rally in New York on Sept. 18. “We’re going to cap it at around 10%. We can’t let them make 25 and 30%.”\nHere is the true value of having a fully paid-off home in America — especially when you're heading into retirement\n'I could've been set for life': This former Goldman Sachs analyst says his family of 4 can't live comfortably on $230K a year after buying 'forever home.' Is the American dream out of reach?\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\nThis proposal stands out given the average credit card interest rate was 21.51% as of May 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. Rates have climbed in recent years, but they've never fallen to the 10% mark based on data going back to 1994.\nHigh interest rates pose a challenge for those with credit card debt, as balances can balloon if repayments don’t keep pace.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported a $27 billion surge in credit card balances in the second quarter of 2024, pushing the total outstanding balance to $1.14 trillion.\nIt’s a big business for banks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates that, each year, Americans pay a whopping $120 billion in credit card interest and fees.\nTrump did not provide details on how he plans to implement the cap, but critics have raised concerns about the pledge.\nPeter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, warned that the 10% interest rate cap would “destroy the entire industry.”\n“Trump just proposed his own version of price controls… Millions of Americans would lose their credit cards,” Schiff wrote on X.\nSchiff, who has expressed support for Trump in this election, stated that he doubts the plan will actually be carried out. Others have echoed this concern.\n“Government-imposed price controls on credit card interest rates would harm all cardholders, especially the lowest income Americans who these measures are intended to help,” an insider from the Consumer Banking Association told the New York Post.\n“This will result in credit cards only being given to consumers who have high income and credit scores who post little risk to card issuers.”\nRead More: Feeling broke on a $665K salary: This surgeon and his wife didn't realize their financial adviser may have been charging a high fee until Ramit Sethi set things straight\nThe American Bankers Association expressed similar concerns.\n“While we don’t know the specific details of this proposal, ABA has opposed similar interest rate cap proposals in the past, including one from Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during the 2020 campaign, because they would result in the loss of credit for the very consumers who need it the most,” the American Bankers Association (ABA) told CNBC.\n“Instead, these consumers would be forced to use less-regulated, more risky alternatives including payday lenders and loan sharks.”\nCredit card interest rates are influenced by several factors, such as an individual's credit score, income, and overall financial profile.\nA higher credit score typically results in lower interest rates because it indicates to lenders that the individual is a low-risk borrower, likely to pay back the borrowed amount on time.\nConversely, a lower credit score suggests a higher risk, prompting lenders to charge higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk of default.\nIncome also plays a crucial role, as higher incomes often lead to better rates. This is because lenders typically view a stable and high income as an indicator of the borrower's ability to meet their financial obligations.\nAdditionally, factors such as the individual's debt-to-income ratio, employment history, and existing debt can also impact the interest rate offered.\nTherefore, the concern is that, if interest rates were capped at an artificially low level, lenders might become more selective in approving credit, effectively excluding those with lower credit scores or incomes. This could force financially vulnerable consumers to turn to less-regulated, higher-risk alternatives.\nIt’s noteworthy that Trump’s proposal resembles one from across the aisle. In 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez proposed a bill to cap credit card interest rates at 15%, though it didn't pass.\nSanders called high credit card interest rates a “profound moral issue.”\n“Every religion understands that usury and loansharking are immoral. And let’s call this what it is, this is loan sharking,” he stated.\nArizona man says his gap insurance won't pay an $18,000 claim for his totaled BMW because of a 60-cent mistake\nTexas man used to spend $9,000 a month partying, now refuses to work more than 15 hours a week to pay off debt\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "date": "2024-12-13T15:57:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "The leader of Southwest Airlines (LUV) is looking forward to the incoming administration of Donald Trump. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, CEO Bob Jordan says the next White House will create a business environment that is favorable for his industry.\n“We work well with every administration, but obviously there’s a lot of thought going in right now with what the change means,” he said. “I think it’s constructive in a lot of ways. Obviously, the tax efforts I think are constructive. The regulatory environment I hope is also more constructive for the industry.”\nOther executives have also expressed excitement about a second Trump presidency. Last month, Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian said that he thinks Trump will represent a “breath of fresh air” after what he called a “level of overreach” by the Biden administration. Likewise, Frontier Airlines (ULCC) CEO Barry Biffle is enthusiastic about what’s to come.\n“There’s also going to be kind of a unshackling,” he told Reuters (TRI). “We’re going to focus on things that matter, like, like safety, and stop worrying about regulating prices and regulating experiences.”\nThe Biden years have brought scrutiny to bear on airline industry practices. His Department of Transportation has focused a lot on so-called “junk fees”, like baggage fees and seat assignment fees. Another policy that has annoyed carriers has been a new rule that requires airlines to automatically refund passengers for canceled flights.\nIn a recent interview, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says that effort in particular will not be likely be rolled back, calling it “the law of the land” after being included in a reauthorization bill for the Federal Aviation Administration.\n“The automatic refunds principle, for example, began as a rule making, but it wound up in the FAA legislation, which means it’s not something that any administration can unilaterally change,” he said.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

        "article_content": "The chief executive of Delta Air Lines says the incoming Trump administration will be a “breath of fresh air” for airlines after what he calls government “overreach” under President Joe Biden.\nThe airline industry has chafed under consumer-protection regulations imposed by the Biden administration. And Delta is facing a federal investigation into its slow recovery from a global technology outage this summer.\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian made the comment as he and fellow Delta executives prepared to host Wall Street analysts at an investor day Wednesday in Atlanta.\nBastian noted that President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to reform the federal government and reduce its size.\nThe airline executive said Trump promised “to take a fresh look at the regulatory environment, the bureaucracy that exists in government, the level of overreach that we have seen over the last four years within our industry. I think that will be a breath of fresh air.”\nSouthwest Airlines CEO Robert Jordan struck a similar tone after a speech last week in Dallas.\n“I think there is a general thought that the new administration could be a little more business-friendly,” Jordan said. “We are hopeful for a DOT (Department of Transportation) that is maybe a little less aggressive in terms of regulating or rule-making.”\nDelta used its investor day to build support for the company, which reported a profit of $2.6 billion in the first nine months of this year after earning an industry-leading $4.6 billion last year.\nThe airline stood by its previous forecast that adjusted profit in the fourth quarter will be between $1.60 and $1.85 per share. The company said its 2025 revenue will rise by a mid-single-digit percentage over 2024. Analysts expect a 6% increase, according to a FactSet survey.\nConsumer advocates are wary of a second Trump administration, fearing that it could try to roll back a rule requiring automatic refunds after canceled flights and another that requires airlines to advertise the full price of fares upfront, including mandatory fees and taxes.\nOn Monday, the airline industry trade group praised Trump's pick for transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin and reality-TV star who is a co-host of “The Bottom Line” on Fox Business. Duffy lobbied for U.S. airlines and their unions during a dispute with Persian Gulf carriers.\nBut Accountable.US, a watchdog nonprofit group, said putting Duffy in charge of the department that oversees airlines was a sign that Trump is \"putting his friends and their corporate special interests ahead of American consumers.”\nBastian did not specify which Biden regulations he considered overreach, but Delta and other carriers are suing the Transportation Department to kill a rule requiring greater transparency over fees that the carriers charge their passengers.\nThe group Airlines for America said the rule would confuse consumers by giving them too much information. An appeals court panel blocked enforcement of the rule while the airlines' lawsuit goes ahead.\nAirlines also oppose an inquiry that the administration recently launched into their frequent-flyer programs. Delta has received more than $2.4 billion in revenue from its loyalty program so far this year.\nBut the hardest blow against Delta could come from a Transportation Department investigation into the airline's slow recovery from a technology outage in July. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said investigators were focusing on whether Delta’s treatment of passengers affected by canceled and delayed flights violated federal consumer-protection rules.\nSouthwest Airlines reached a $140 million settlement after a Transportation Department investigation into a similar but larger breakdown in service in December 2022.\nDelta initially said it was cooperating with the investigation. In October, Delta sued CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity provider whose faulty upgrade to Microsoft computers triggered the outage."

        "article_content": "Donald Trump made waves during a Long Island campaign stop by suggesting a cap on credit card interest rates, a proposal that quickly drew sharp criticism.\nSpeaking to a lively crowd of around 16,000 at the Nassau Coliseum, the former president announced a plan to limit interest rates to 10%. According to Federal Reserve data, this is a dramatic cut from the current average of 21.5%.\nDon't Miss:\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?\nCan you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\"We're going to cap it at around 10%. We can't let them make 25 and 30%,\" Trump declared to thunderous applause. \"While working Americans catch up, we're going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates.\"\nThe move is part of Trump's broader economic pitch, but critics are raising alarms, arguing it could have unintended consequences. Industry insiders have drawn comparisons between Trump's proposal and what they label “price controls” akin to measures suggested by Democrats.\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\"Trump just proposed his version of price controls,\" remarked euro Pacific Asset Management chief economist Peter Schiff. Schiff warned that such a cap could spell disaster for the credit card industry.\n\"It would destroy the industry and millions of Americans would lose their credit cards,\" he added. \"There are heavy losses in credit cards from people who don't pay, so they need the high interest rates to offset that. There's also a lot of fraud.\"\nTrending: Founder of Personal Capital and ex-CEO of PayPal re-engineers traditional banking with this new high-yield account — start saving better today.\nDespite Trump's confident claims, no credit card interest rates have ever dipped to 10% in recorded data, which dates back to 1994. Rates surged starting in early 2022, largely due to inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics worry that capping rates could backfire, hurting the people Trump says he's trying to help.\nAn insider from the Consumer Bankers Association didn't mince words, telling The Post, \"Government-imposed price controls on credit card interest rates would harm all cardholders, especially the lowest-income Americans.\" According to the source, consumers with lower incomes or poor credit scores could be denied access to credit entirely.\nThe American Bankers Association, another key player in the financial industry, echoed these concerns. \"We've opposed similar interest rate cap proposals in the past,\" said a spokesperson for the group, referencing efforts from figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to limit rates to 15%.\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\"They would result in the loss of credit for the consumers who need it the most. Instead, these consumers would be forced to turn to less-regulated, more risky alternatives like payday lenders and loan sharks.\"\nTrump's proposed rate cap also mirrors recent political debates about price controls. Last month, Trump fiercely criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for proposing a crackdown on price gouging in the food industry. At the time, he labeled her plan \"communist\" and accused her of being a \"Marxist.\"\nTrump's camp remained tight-lipped about how the credit card rate cap would be implemented despite The Post’s requests for clarification. However, the 45th president has continued to make bold promises.\nBefore the Long Island rally, Trump pledged to cut car insurance rates, claiming on social media, \"Your Automobile Insurance is up 73% – VOTE FOR TRUMP, I'LL CUT THAT NUMBER IN HALF!\"\nRead Next:\nIRS Finalizes 10-Year Rule For Retirement Withdrawals, Making Things ‘Even More Insanely Complicated’\nAre you richer than most people you know?

        "date": "2024-11-25T16:16:07.000Z",
        "article_content": "Trump-supporting retirees have gone all-in on investing in Trump Media, even as the stock has proven to be volatile.\nOne user, who only goes by @DTLjohnny, said on Trump Media-owned Truth Social he sunk 98% of his total retirement into the stock. As of September, he estimated he had lost 60% of his investment. Nevertheless, he seemed confident in the company’s ability to right its sails.\n\"But I knew this day would come when the Deep State crooks would become so desperate that they would shove all-in with their counterfeit shares.  Everybody can see what they’re doing. And I believe this is part of the plan of full exposure,” the user wrote in September. “And there ain’t no way Trump’s letting them bankrupt his company! Have faith. He and [Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes] have a plan. But it’s a plan that they have to keep secret…for now.”\nHe likely recouped a big chunk of his losses. Shares soared more than 300% from a late-September low to late-October high but have since retreated about 40%.\nAnother investor expressed concern about the stock. John Viaud, a South Carolina retiree, said his “entire pension is in jeopardy” after losing $600,000 on investments in Trump Media.\n“If we don’t see a green day tomorrow I may need to bail,” he said in a Truth Social post in September.\nIn a separate post, Truth Social chastised the Washington Post’s previous coverage of investors who lost money on Trump Media stock, saying the outlet came to “preconceived conclusions” and omitted Trump Media’s full critique of the story’s content.\nViaud, responding to Truth Social’s criticism of the Post story, said he continued to invest in Trump Media and he was able to mostly recover his loss “due to the success of the companies [sic] stock performance.”\nFortune was unable to independently verify the Truth Social users’ investment portfolios. The users did not respond to Fortune’s interview requests, and Trump Media did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nPersistent backing of Trump’s media and technology company has become a way for Trump’s followers to show their fervent support for the president-elect. But these retirees who were do-or-die on Trump Media prior to the election are in for a tough wake-up call if they’re still pouring funds into the stock after Trump’s Nov. 5 triumph. Despite a 6% boost for the stock the day after the election, share prices have since fallen 13%, erasing the earlier gain.\nThe stock followed the pattern of a larger \"Trump bump\" of stock explosions shortly after the election—which helped the S&P 500 gain 3.5% in the second week of November, its best post-election session ever—but has since mellowed.\nTrump Media has always been volatile. It’s lost more than 53% of its value since March 26, which marked its first day trading as a public company after its special purpose acquisition company merger. To further spook investors, executives like CFO Phillip Juhan and company director Eric Swider have sold a combined 536,000 shares of the company since the election. Trump himself has said he won’t sell his stock, remaining its largest shareholder with 54% ownership, worth about $3.2 billion.\nTrump Media’s rocky path since the election indicates Trump’s victory hasn’t solved the stock’s volatility or Truth Social’s financials.\nAccording to recent filings, Trump Media is hemorrhaging money, largely because Truth Social’s conservative usership remains narrow and because its main source of revenue is advertising dollars, which totaled just $2.6 million in the first nine months of the year and were down 23% from a year ago. The company lost $363 million in the same period. Trump Media is now considering creating a cryptocurrency payment platform called TruthFi, which would act as another revenue source.\nTrump’s Truth Social was originally started in early 2022 as a way for Trump to platform his ideas after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But Elon Musk’s X—which has 70.4 million monthly active users to Truth Social’s 698,000 as of September, according to Similarweb—has become a hotbed for spreading conservative ideology since Musk bought the app in October 2022. Trump returned to the platform in August 2023. With an alliance between the two sites speculated to be in the works, Truth Social’s value proposition as an amplifier for Trump and his followers has weakened.\n“Trump Media’s whole argument was: We’re going to allow freedom of expression in a way that hasn’t existed in years,” Mike Stegemoller, a Baylor University finance professor, told the Washington Post.\nTrump’s return to the presidency—and an international platform carefully watched by global leaders, followers, and opponents, alike—further diminishes the appeal of an app built specifically to provide a voice for him.\n“That doesn’t bode well for a company that already makes very little revenue,” Stegemoller said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump’s win could significantly influence the travel industry, particularly in terms of pricing.\nHis proposed policies on immigration, trade and foreign relations may reshape international travel demand and costs. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and potential changes to airline regulations could directly affect airfare, hotel stays and tourism services.\nLearn More: How President-Elect Trump’s Win Could Change Gas Prices\nTry This: 5 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money That Actually Work\n“A stronger U.S. dollar would definitely make international travel cheaper for U.S. citizens by increasing their purchasing power abroad,” said Robert Hoffman at Xchange of America, a leading online money exchange platform.\nHere’s how President-elect Trump’s win could impact the price of travel.\nTrending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\nTrump is likely to continue U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) recommendations from earlier this year that required more transparency in baggage price policy and refunds for significantly delayed or canceled trips.\n“I don’t believe Trump would reverse baggage or refund policies, regardless of his business deregulation policies,” Hoffman said. “In this case, the consumers have loudly spoken and will continue to do so with their wallet.”\nAccording to the DOT’s Air Travel Consumer Report, United Airlines Network reported 48,366 mishandled bags during August alone.\n“These are consumers who have landed without clothing, footwear, personal care items, and should be compensated for this extreme inconvenience,” Hoffman said. “Imagine touching down in Helsinki, Finland at this time of year at 27 degrees Fahrenheit and your $200 snow boots and $500 Helly Hanson ski suit have been lost by the airline.”\nHoffman said consumers should be protected against the additional unexpected costs, lost time and stress. “An airline credit isn’t always a fair option.”\nRead Next: How President-Elect Trump’s Win Could Impact Grocery Prices\nJesse Neugarten, CEO and founder of Dollar Flight Club, said Trump’s pro-business stance might lead to fewer regulations and a relaxed antitrust scrutiny.\n“For example, Trump’s administration might be more open to approving airline mergers and partnerships, such as a revised version of the previously blocked JetBlue-Spirit merger or new iterations of partnerships like the American-JetBlue Northeast Alliance,” Neugarten said. “This could lead to reduced competition, potentially driving up prices in the long term by 10%-20%.”\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States produced record levels of crude oil during President Joe Biden’s administration. However, Trump’s strong stance on fossil fuels could further accelerate production growth.\n“Trump’s emphasis on promoting U.S.-based fossil fuel drilling and exportation would presumably lower the cost of fuel and related travel prices for U.S. consumers,” Hoffman said. “As domestic production ramps up, supply will increase, and prices will fall.”\nThe possible reinstatement of multi-country, international travel bans under Trump could eliminate thousands of incoming and outgoing flights and the money they bring to the travel industry.\n“It has the potential to trigger pilot and flight attendant layoffs and increased prices on all other remaining domestic and foreign flights to make up for it,” Hoffman said. “Hypothetically, of course; this is uncharted territory in terms of U.S. travel policy.”\nHoffman said President-elect Trump’s potential policies on tariffs could affect travel prices, specifically the cost of flights.\n“Delta Airlines currently stocks 450 European-manufactured Airbus jets, with 200 on order,” Hoffman said. “It would be safe to assume that Delta — and any other airline — importing multi-million dollar’s worth of overseas-manufactured aircraft will need to increase flight prices to offset the significant import tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump.”\nHoffman explained, “Even U.S-based Boeing wouldn’t be exempt, as imported parts and steel would be subject to tariffs, as well, depending on how the legislation is written.”\nTravelers can take these proactive steps to stay ahead of potential changes in airline policies and rising travel costs. Neugarten recommended:\nChecking departures from multiple airports\nExpanding your travel search to find deals\nSetting up price alerts or subscribing to a flight deal service\nSearching for one-way instead of round-trip flights\nCheck if the price of your booked flight has dropped and get a refund or credit.\n“Global factors could also influence travel costs under Trump when you look at resolving conflicts in regions like Ukraine or the Middle East,” Neugarten said. “It could stabilize energy prices, potentially lowering costs for travelers. However, Trump’s visa policies and trade tariffs could counteract these benefits.”\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his top priority if reelected to the White House will be to “drill, baby, drill” to lower the cost of energy.\n“Republicans have a plan to bring down prices and bring them down very, very rapidly. By slashing energy costs, we will in turn reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing, and all household goods,\" said Trump last Thursday during the Republican National Convention.\nThe problem with that is energy companies won't want to pump more oil if it gets too cheap, industry watchers say.\n“You’re not going to produce so much that you decrease the price of your product that much,” Samantha Gross, director of energy security and climate initiative at the non-partisan think tank Brookings Institution.\nA Dallas Fed nationwide energy survey showed firms need oil to be at $64 per barrel on average to profitably drill. On Wednesday, West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) hovered above $77 per barrel. Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, exchanged hands just above $81 per barrel.\n“The lower the price goes, the less US producers will drill [or] pump as fewer wells will be profitable,” Rebecca Babin, US senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth, told Yahoo Finance this week.\nFresh off a wave of consolidation, oil companies are focused on returning cash to shareholders and capital discipline— both of which “keep 'drill, baby, drill' in check,” said Babin.\n“Consolidation will give acquiring companies more influence over US production. The larger companies have been more focused on capital returns and will likely be less influenced by political backdrop,” she added.\nTrump’s biggest lever to influence producers would likely be easing permitting restrictions for drilling on public land, says Philip Rossetti, resident senior fellow for the energy policy program at center right-leaning think tank R Street Institute.\nA look at the drilling permitting process in past years by the Government Accountability Office found that in 2016 when Democratic President Barack Obama was in office, it took an average of 196 days to review applications for permits. That process was cut by more than half by 2019 when Trump was in office.\n“That’s a huge difference,” said Rossetti. “There is this big qualitative difference on how easy is it to navigate the process and increase production on federal land — which is a huge portion of our oil and gas production.”\nEarlier this year the Biden administration raised the royalty rates by more than one-third to 16.67% on federal land drilling. Wall Street expects everything from royalties to pipeline restrictions to potentially be scaled back if Trump wins the presidency.\n\"I think you would have immediately much less energy restrictions,\" Neal Dingmann, Truist Securities energy research managing director, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\nThe mere anticipation of production going materially higher could cause oil prices to \"fall at least 10% if not closer to 20%\" to the $70 or high-$60s per barrel level, said the analyst.\nConversely, if the Democrats keep control, with current restrictions in place, \"prices [could] go up even over $90 a barrel,\" he added.\nDespite Democrats' intention to wean the US off fossil fuels, it's worth noting the oil industry reached record profits and production during the Biden administration.\nYahoo Finance’s stats wizard Jared Blikre points out the S&P 500 Energy Select ETF (XLE) soared 218% from the start of Biden’s presidency, with the oil majors posting record profits as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent crude futures skyrocketing.\nDuring the Trump administration, XLE fell 56% as demand plunged during the pandemic.\n\"Yes, Trump has some levers he could pull that could lower cost by increasing production, but those levers are only one component of energy prices that are mostly dictated by global markets,\" said Rossetti.\nJPMorgan strategists see Brent's average falling from $83 in 2024 to $75 next year, in part due to decelerating demand growth and greater electric vehicle use.\nIn June oil alliance OPEC+ announced it would keep most of its reductions in place into 2025 but start a gradual unwind of its voluntary cuts in October. The oil alliance led by Saudi Arabia started cutting output in late 2022 in order to keep a floor on prices.\n\"My expectation is that Trump would go barter with the OPEC nations to increase production,\" Ed Hirs, senior fellow at the University of Houston, told Yahoo Finance.\nUnlike other oil-producing countries, the US industry is privatized, making it more difficult to impact producers' output.\n\"[Trump's] intention for lower oil prices to benefit the public — this will come at the expense of the domestic oil industry,\" said Hirs.\nIt's one of those \"be careful what you wish for\" scenarios, he added. \nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "During the interview on Monday between Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump, the concerns about AI’s significant energy consumption were raised.\nWhat Happened: While speaking with Musk Trump voiced his concerns about AI’s substantial electricity demands. He recognized Musk’s passion for AI but noted his surprise by the technology’s high energy requirements.\n“This is shocking to me, but AI requires twice the energy that the country already produces,” the former President stated.\nDon’t Miss:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nThis startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\nAdding, “You are gonna need tremendous amounts of electricity, like almost double what we produce now for the whole country, if you can believe it.”\nWhy It Matters: The Republican presidential candidate wasn’t off the mark or the first person to raise such concerns. The energy demands of AI have been a topic of concern for some time.\nIn April this year, Arm Holdings plc.

        "article_content": "The impact of a 10% to 20% tariff on America's trading partners floated last week by Donald Trump has raised trade issues anew on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\"It's basically you hurt us, and we hurt you,\" Trump said on Monday in Pennsylvania while discussing his desire to put up reciprocal tariffs on trading partners.\n\"It's an eye for an eye, and it's common sense,\" added Trump, who was weighed into the topic repeatedly in recent days.\nDemocrats are also seizing on the idea, with Kamala Harris charging that it would represent a \"national sales tax.\" And President Joe Biden, among others, brought it up Monday night as Democrats gathered in Chicago for their convention.\n\"Donald Trump wants a new tax on imported goods: food, gas, clothing, and more,\" the president said during his keynote speech.\nTrump's idea for blanket tariffs is one of a series of proposals in recent days from both sides that economists don't love, including Harris’s plan to impose the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and a new homeowner subsidy of $25,000.\nBut trade experts are deeply skeptical of a notion Trump has pushed in recent days that a tariff \"doesn't affect our country.\"\n\"At the end of the day, it's the US importer that will absorb [the tariff] and the US consumer ultimately that will pay the price,\" Ashley Craig, a Washington, D.C.-based trade lawyer, said this week, echoing the concerns of many.\n\"I think he's deliberately refusing to recognize that,\" Craig, the chair of Venable's International Trade Group, added about Trump.\nThe back-and-forth is the latest chapter in a debate over trade that has raged for years, ever since Trump instituted a historic wave of duties on China and other trading partners.\nHis move while in office upended decades of free-trade doctrine in Washington and proved to be durable. Biden has not only kept the duties in place but raised them in certain \"strategic\" sectors.\nIn pitching a return to office, Trump had already proposed a massive expansion of those trade wars, including a 10% tariff on imports from around the world and 60% duties on goods from China.\nThen came last week and the speech in Asheville, N.C.\n\"We are going to have 10% to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years,\" he told the crowd, repeating the point for emphasis.\nTrump then followed up with an extended discussion of tariffs during a rally Saturday in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., where he said, among other things, that \"a tariff is a tax on a foreign country: That's the way it is, whether you like it or not.\"\nHe added that \"it's a tax that doesn't affect our country.\"\nMany economists and trade experts strongly beg to differ, noting that tariffs are actually assessed on companies as they bring goods into the United States.\nThere is a debate about exactly how those costs are distributed, but it's clear that consumers bear a large burden in the form of increased prices.\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics has run the numbers and found that Trump's initial tariff ideas (60% duties on China and 10% on other trading partners) would lead to a typical middle-class household paying at least $1,700 more each year.\nAnother estimate from Brendan Duke of the left-leaning Center for American Progress comes in even higher. He finds that a 10% tariff combined with 60% on Chinese goods could mean an additional cost of $2,500 for a typical family in the middle of the income distribution.\nAnd a 20% tariff could mean an additional cost of $3,900.\nEven Trump himself seemed to back away slightly on Monday during an appearance in Pennsylvania, where he didn't repeat the possibility of 20% tariffs and downplayed the effects of 10% duties.\n\"A small 10% tariff on foreign-made products will allow massive tax cuts for working families,\" he said, citing a study from a group called Coalition for a Prosperous America that found tariffs would raise consumer prices by about half a percent per year but that those increases could be offset by tax cuts.\nTrump and his allies also often point out in response to critics that inflation remained under control during the four years of his presidency — even as that first round of tariffs went into place.\nThe criticisms of Trump's plan have indeed flowed in from a range of current and former Democratic officials.\n\"It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs,\" Harris said last week in North Carolina, likening tariffs to \"a national sales tax.\"\nWillett Advisors LLC chairman and CEO Steven Rattner — a former Obama administration official — said in a recent interview on Yahoo Finance that Trump's tariff agenda would be a \"hugely regressive form of tax\" that could spur new inflation.\nHarris, meanwhile, hasn't outlined her tariff agenda yet, but some experts expect she could be a reset of sorts on the issue as she has been focused elsewhere during her time as vice president.\nHarris did vote no in 2020 on the Trump-negotiated USMCA trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. She cited the need for more worker and environmental protections as her reason for opposition.\nShe appears likely to continue much of Biden's approach for now, according to Venable's Craig.\n\"I don't see her, frankly, walking away from the Trump tariffs that Biden has not walked away from, maybe a little bit of relief here and there like Mr. Biden did,\" he said.\nCraig added: \"I wouldn't see a radical transformation if there was a Harris White House.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "title": "Big Tech CEOs rush to congratulate Trump on election win",
        "date": "2024-11-07T18:05:54.000Z",
        "article_content": "The heads and founders of the biggest tech companies in the world are lining up to congratulate President-elect Trump on his second term following the election results Tuesday night. From Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos to Microsoft’s (MSFT) Satya Nadella and Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, some of the most powerful names in the tech industry quickly moved to get off on the right foot with the president-elect.\nTrump is entering a tech landscape that’s changed dramatically over the last four years thanks to the rise of generative artificial intelligence.\nTech companies are also staring down a number of antitrust lawsuits that Trump has the power to, if not call off, then at least provide marching orders with regard to potential remedies.\nBig Tech has had an often acrimonious relationship with both the Trump and Biden administrations. After the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, Meta, Twitter, and YouTube banned Trump’s social media accounts, though they’ve each since reinstated them. Trump has an extra distaste for Zuckerberg, going as far as threatening to jail the CEO for life in his book.\nZuckerberg didn’t outright endorse Trump during the lead-up to the election, though during an interview with Bloomberg, he did say that Trump’s reaction to his assassination attempt, raising his fist in the air, was “badass.” The CEO then added, “On some level as an American, it’s hard to not get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight, and I think that that’s why a lot of people like the guy.”\nZuckerberg posted his congratulatory note to Trump on his X competitor Threads, saying he looks forward to working with the Trump administration.\n“We have great opportunities ahead of us as a country. Looking forward to working with you and your administration,” he wrote.\nBezos also has a difficult relationship with Trump. The Amazon and Blue Origin founder also owns the Washington Post, which Trump has accused of being biased against him. The Post was preparing to endorse Trump’s rival Vice President Kamala Harris for president, but in a stunning move Bezos forced the paper to cancel its plans.\nAs a result, the Post has reportedly lost more than 200,000 subscribers. Bezos then penned an op-ed for the paper saying that the decision to pull the endorsement was a principled one and that backing one candidate creates the perception of bias.\nBut Bezos also lauded Trump’s win on Wednesday, writing, “Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.”\nMicrosoft’s Nadella and Apple’s Cook also offered their congratulations to Trump, with both CEOs saying that they look forward to engaging with the president-elect and his administration. Microsoft and Apple have had relatively good relationships with Trump over the years and have avoided much of the problems that Zuckerberg and Bezos have faced.\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai also congratulated Trump on his “decisive” victory, adding that the US is in a “golden age of American innovation” and that Google is committed to working with Trump’s administration.\nTrump has criticized Google over the years for displaying negative articles about him in search results, most recently telling Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait that he called “the head of Google” about not seeing enough positive stories about him.\nNvidia’s (NVDA) Jensen Huang, meanwhile, hasn’t said anything about the election, choosing to stay impartial even when the issue has come up during press interviews. Huang isn’t active on social media either, making it easier to avoid having to make any statements related to the broader political environment.\nAMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su has also avoided the election despite having a public X profile. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, on the other hand, congratulated Trump on his win.\nGelsinger’s Intel (INTC) is working to ensure it gets its promised share of billions of dollars from the CHIPS Act, one of the Biden administration’s hallmark pieces of bipartisan legislation meant to bring chip manufacturing back to the US.\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson threw the fate of the CHIPS Act into question earlier this week, saying he would repeal the legislation before quickly walking his statement back.\nWith Trump now set to be sworn in come January, the CEOs will have to hope that their early well wishes will pay dividends over the next four years.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "article_content": "Regardless of emotional feelings on the election, certain stocks stand to gain with the Trump administration.\nPalantir Technologies, Tesla and Talkspace stocks have strong price momentum that are set to gain even further.\nRegister now to see our 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days report - free today!\nHalf the country is happy, and half the country is sad, that’s the way democracy goes sometimes. This is a financial publication, so we are going to focus on the economic and market implications of a Trump presidency.\nI think Trump is likely to be positive for economic growth in the US, as his prior presidential period was noted by a pickup in economic activity. In the past it was driven primarily by a lowering of corporate and personal taxes and an attempt to decrease broad regulations. It was a simple and fairly effective method to initiate growth, pulling on some of the primary levers moving the economy.\nOf course, there are other factors outside of the presidential scope, which can have an equal if not larger impact on the stock market and economic performance. Including but not limited to, Federal Reserve policy, geopolitics and long-term economic cycles such as demographics.\nWhile acknowledging the role the president plays in the performance of the stock market, I have identified three stocks that I believe will benefit from a Trump presidency as well as broader business trends. Palantir Technologies (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA) and Talkspace (TALK) all enjoy specific factors which align with a Trump led economy, but also boast strong price momentum and top Zacks Ranks.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nElon Musk played a pretty important role in helping to get Donald Trump elected. With large donations through his Super PAC and plenty of chatter on X.com where he has 200 million followers, he showed a major effort to assist Trump.\nThis is no small matter and Tesla stock is reflecting this new position Musk now plays in the broader political sphere. TSLA stock is up nearly 14% on the day as of this writing and is now making new year-to-date (YTD) highs.\nTesla also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting some significant revisions higher to its earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings estimates have jumped 13.4% over the last 60 days and FY24 estimates have climbed by 7.5% over the same period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPalantir Technologies stands to benefit significantly from a Trump presidency, given the company’s strong government ties and focus on defense and intelligence solutions. Known for its work with federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and other national security branches, Palantir is well-positioned for potential expansions in government contracts that could follow pro-defense and security spending policies.\nThe company’s advanced data analytics and AI-driven solutions are particularly valuable for enhancing national security initiatives, making it a likely choice for additional contracts under an administration focused on bolstering the military and intelligence sectors.\nAdding to its appeal, Palantir holds a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, which reflects an upward trend in its earnings outlook. Just take a look at the stock today and you will see how wall street is favoring it. PLTR stock has been on a tear since the summer and is up nearly 6% as of this writing.\nImage Source: TradingView\nTalkspace, an online therapy platform, is well-positioned to see increased demand as a result of heightened emotions in the current political climate. With the polarizing effect of Trump’s presidency, many people who feel deeply impacted by his policies may increasingly turn to mental health resources to cope.\nTalkspace is also already showing strong growth forecasts, with annual sales expected to grow more than 20% this year and next. Additionally, Talkspace holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating optimism from analysts about its growth trajectory.\nAs public awareness and acceptance of mental health services continue to grow, Talkspace is primed to benefit from both increased demand and favorable industry trends.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor investors navigating the post-election landscape, focusing on stocks with both promising fundamentals and an edge in a Trump-led economy may be an effective strategy. Tesla, Palantir, and Talkspace each stand out as companies that could benefit from a pro-business environment as well as from specific sectoral trends that align with a Trump presidency.\nThese stocks are well-positioned for potential growth, both due to political trends and strong underlying business fundamentals. Investing in companies with solid revenue and earnings growth, favorable valuations, and high Zacks Ranks has historically proven more reliable than attempting to predict how any single administration will influence the stock market. Ultimately, these picks offer a mix of industry resilience and alignment with broader economic trends, making them promising options for a Trump presidency and beyond.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "date": "2024-12-01T09:45:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to shake things up in Washington in his second term. Mass deportations, high tariffs on all imports, extended tax cuts, and greater deregulation are just a few of the commitments he made as a presidential candidate.\nBut how could Trump's policies affect the 54 million Americans who receive Social Security retirement benefits? Here are the two main changes he wants to make to Social Security.\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop? Breakfast News delivers it all in a quick, Foolish, and free daily newsletter. Sign Up For Free »\nCurrently, around 40% of individuals pay federal income taxes on their Social Security benefits. Whether or not recipients are in this group depends on how much money they make.\nUp to 85% of Social Security benefits may be subject to federal income taxes based on individuals' combined income (adjusted gross income plus nontaxable interest plus half of their Social Security benefits) and federal tax filing type.\nTrump wants to eliminate these taxes for seniors. He isn't the first politician to propose doing away with federal taxes on Social Security benefits. One of the most recent efforts to do so — the You Earned It, You Keep It Act — was introduced in Congress earlier this year.\nThroughout much of the history of the Social Security program, benefits weren't taxed at the federal level. That changed in 1984 when a bipartisan plan to financially strengthen Social Security was implemented.\nDuring the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' proposal to increase the full retirement age to maintain the Social Security program's solvency. Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in a town hall, \"You don't have to touch Social Security.\"\nInstead, Trump suggested that the U.S. has \"liquid gold\" (oil and gas) that could be used to bolster the program's finances. He said the country could also pay down its national debt by increased oil and gas drilling.\nIt's unrealistic to expect major changes for Social Security in Trump's first year back in office. But could they happen in 2026? That could be a stretch, too.\nThe main challenge with eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security benefits is that doing so would cause the program's trust funds to run out of money earlier than projected. Trump would be highly unlikely to secure the 60 Senate votes needed to bypass an almost certain filibuster.\nCould the GOP attach language to eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits in a budget bill that can't be filibustered? Nope. The Byrd rule prevents changing Social Security through the budget reconciliation process.\nMaybe Republicans in the Senate could decide to scrap the filibuster altogether. However, this also seems unlikely considering that the incoming Senate majority leader, John Thune, and other GOP senators have committed to leaving the filibuster in place even if it means parts of Trump's agenda won't be passed.\nTrump probably could incrementally boost U.S. oil and gas drilling, perhaps even before 2026. For example, he could make more federal land available for drilling and eliminate some regulatory barriers for the industry.\nBut domestic production is already at an all-time high. The industry could reduce production on its own if prices fall too much due to oversupply.\nMore importantly, though, increased drilling might not help Social Security very much. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analyzed Trump's idea and found that using current oil and gas leasing revenue to fund Social Security would address less than 4% of its projected shortfall. It also determined that Social Security's financial issues wouldn't be solved even if all federal land was made available for drilling.\nPresidents don't always get what they want. Because of the political and economic realities, it seems likely that Trump won't get what he wants with Social Security by 2026 — and perhaps not by the time his second term ends in January 2029.\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

        "date": "2024-04-26T17:17:33.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump’s aides have drawn up secret plans to oust the chairman of the Federal Reserve and allow the president to set interest rates, according to reports.\nAllies are said to have drawn up a range of proposals for the way monetary policy could be run in a second Trump administration, including rolling back the independence of the central bank, which has been critical to the functioning of the economy and financial system in recent decades.\nSupporters of the Republican candidate have compiled a 10-page document with a new vision for the running of the central bank and monetary policy, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nIt includes the authority to eject Jerome Powell from his position as chairman of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\nMr Trump appointed Mr Powell to the position in his first term as president, having declined to give the incumbent, Janet Yellen, a second term at the Federal Reserve.\nMs Yellen is now Treasury secretary for Joe Biden, the president.\nThe document also suggests Mr Trump could be consulted on interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve chair, who would then negotiate the final decision on borrowing costs with other policymakers on his behalf.\nLess sweeping changes to the central bank could include exposing its regulations to more regular reviews by the White House, the WSJ reported.\nAs president, Mr Trump regularly called for lower interest rates to boost the economy and expressed dissatisfaction with Mr Powell’s decisions. In 2019, he said Fed officials had “no guts, no sense, no vision”.\nMoves to limit the independence of the Fed would likely prove controversial. The independence of central banks has become a central pillar of the modern financial system.\nMichael Pearce at Oxford Economics said: “Any serious attempt to undermine the Fed would have a high risk of having the opposite effect. There are many examples from history where political pressure for lower rates has had the opposite effect and pushed the Fed to lean towards tighter policy than otherwise.”\nEven if interest rates did come down, financial markets would recognise the risk of higher inflation and charge the US government a higher borrowing cost to compensate. This would offset any anticipated boost to the economy.\nThe temptation for the president to lower interest rates under the proposed system could also prolong the inflation crisis in the US.\nJames Knightley, economist at ING, said: “If Trump lets inflation rip it is likely to be his own supporters that will be most hurt. Trump may want lower interest rates, but if inflation becomes entrenched, that could be the bigger threat to the success of his presidency.”\nStrong consumer spending and stubborn inflation has raised expectations that the Fed will have to keep interest rates higher for longer in its battle to keep a lid on price rises.\nCore inflation held firm at 2.8pc in March, new figures showed on Friday, rather than falling as analysts had expected.\nCharles Hepworth at GAM Investments said this rate of price rises would force Mr Powell to keep rates on hold.\nHe said: “This is a level that hardly augers in early rate cuts.”\nInterest rates, which stand at 5.5pc in the US, are set to play a key role in this year’s election. Traders in financial markets have priced in just one cut for this year, most likely to come in November.\nIf that forecast holds true, the timing of the election means Americans will not benefit from lower borrowing costs by the time they go to the polls.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "date": "2024-04-10T21:30:56.000Z",
        "article_content": "Technology has afforded us the ability to connect with nearly anyone, anytime—and free of charge. But there’s just something nostalgic and tactile about receiving a letter or postcard via snail mail, whether it be a wedding invitation or postcard from a loved one far away.\nBut many also have a love-hate relationship with the United States Postal Service. Mail is lost, undelivered—or even returned, sometimes with a valid postmark and address. Indeed, “the Postal Service’s ability to provide acceptable service is an ongoing concern across the United States,” according to the Office of Inspector General for the United States Postal Service.\nYet USPS announced Tuesday a proposed 8% price hike for stamps, bringing the cost of a first-class mail forever stamp to $0.73. It’s just another sign of the unfavorable leadership of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump. DeJoy was a major Republican Party donor and Trump fundraiser—and was also the first postmaster general in two decades without prior USPS experience.\nUnder DeJoy, the USPS has been bleeding money. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 alone, USPS reported a $2.1 billion net loss, more than double its $1 billion net loss during the same time period last year.\n“Under DeJoy, USPS has not adequately been controlling labor costs, while quality of service has been going down and prices going up,” said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that specializes in productivity and innovation issues. “This is not sustainable, and the more prices go up the more volumes go down, until USPS hits a death spiral.”\nBut DeJoy, who was previously under investigation by the FBI in connection with past political fundraising, says he has a 10-year plan to revive the postal service. He’s been in his role since June 2020, and plans to serve his entire appointment. Plus, President Joe Biden doesn’t have the power to remove him from his post, despite how badly the agency is struggling.\n“Get used to me,” DeJoy said in February 2021. The postmaster general is appointed by the Board of Governors of the Postal Service—and can only be dismissed by this group, not the president. However, the governors are appointed by the president, and in 2022, 83 public interest groups led by the Save the Post Office Coalition sent a letter to Biden urging him to nominate postal board of governors candidates who would hold DeJoy accountable for his “destructive leadership and advocate strongly for the expansion of USPS services.”\n“The president’s nominees should provide a diversity of life experience to more accurately represent both the postal workforce and the nation overall—not just another rich white man like Louis DeJoy,” Porter McConnell, cofounder of the Save the Post Office Coalition, said in a statement.\nThis is the second time in six months that USPS has requested to raise service prices, most recently hiking shipping service rates 5.4% in November 2023.\n“Pricing changes in the mailing and shipping marketplace continue, [and] these price adjustments are needed to achieve the financial stability sought by the organization’s Delivering for America 10-year plan,” a USPS spokesperson tells Fortune. “The Postal Service prices remain among the most affordable in the world.”\nWhile this may be—at surface level—part of DeJoy’s master plan to remedy poor service across the country, the entity likely won’t be able to continue to raise prices indefinitely, experts say.\n“USPS is raising prices because it consistently loses money on its business and subsidizing the USPS with general tax dollars is unpopular—and unnecessary,” Stephen Henn, adjunct professor of economics and finance at Sacred Heart University, tells Fortune. Plus, USPS can’t be as profitable as FedEx or UPS because the cost to mail letters and packages still is comparatively much cheaper than using a for-profit option.\nSome of the factors that contribute to dissatisfaction among USPS users—and overall decreased productivity—include reduced mail volumes, increased operating costs, and a “rapid shift” toward digital communications, Robert Khachatryan, CEO of Freight Right Global Logistics, tells Fortune.\nAccording to DeJoy’s 10-year plan, he hopes to modernize operations and enhance competitiveness in the shipping and mailing industry while mail volumes decline, Khachatryan says. But it also seeks to add funding to address ongoing USPS service challenges across the country. Nearly every U.S. state is below target levels for on-time service, according to Office of Inspector General for the United States Postal Service data.\n“The push for price increases partly stems from the ongoing challenge of maintaining acceptable service levels,” Khachatryan says. “The Office of the Inspector General’s reports highlight service as a persistent concern, suggesting that additional revenue from higher prices could be directed towards improving operational efficiencies and customer service.”\nPlus, USPS has requirements that for-profit businesses like FedEx and UPS do not. USPS has to deliver first-class mail to every address in the U.S. at the same rate, despite the distance.\n“Sending Grandma a holiday card costs the same whether sent from Maine to New York or Maine to Hawaii,” Henn says. “For-profit companies can charge based on the cost of delivering from Maine to New York or Hawaii.”\nDespite the challenges of competing with for-profit organizations, DeJoy remains confident that he can rescue the ailing agency in the years to come.\n“I grow more confident in our ability to deliver to the nation a postal service whose best days are in the future,” DeJoy told the USPS Board of Governors in February. “We are in a race to a finish line that changes our financial and service trajectory before we run out of cash and require other means of funding.”\nBut other experts don’t have as rosy an outlook for the agency, which technically operates independently from the executive branch of the U.S. federal government.\n“The Postal Regulatory Commission needs to stop being so passive and start holding USPS accountable to cut costs and boost efficiencies,” Atkinson says. “Congress may well have to intervene as well, because the current trend is not sustainable.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday evening that investor Scott Bessent will be his nominee for Treasury secretary, picking a campaign trail partner and early frontrunner for the job after a long and contentious process.\nTrump called him \"one of the World's foremost International Investors\" in his announcement, adding that he is \"a strong advocate of the America First agenda.\"\nBessent beat out a series of other candidates from former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to Apollo Global Management (APO) CEO Marc Rowan to cap a drawn-out process that saw candidates’ chances seem to rise and fall by the day. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management).\nAssuming he is indeed nominated and then confirmed, Bessent will face the difficult challenge in the months ahead of simultaneously working to calm US and global markets while also being tasked with selling many of the president-elect's economic plans.\nThe issue is that many of those ideas remain unpopular in business world corners — specifically renewed tariffs and, perhaps, increased deficit spending.\nIn a live Yahoo Finance video appearance earlier on Friday, Hoover Institution fellow Lanhee Chen offered that Trump's nominee would need to be well-qualified, aligned with his economic agenda, and also serve as \"a calming force to markets.\"\nFrom the beginning of the process, Bessent was often viewed as the front-runner for the post, but saw his fortunes rise and fall. The former Soros Fund Management investing chief met with Trump multiple times in the weeks following the election after being a regular campaign trail partner of the president-elect.\nThe race was anything but drama-free, with betting markets yo-yoing in recent days and Polymarket odds putting three different candidates as the favorite at various points.\nTrump ended up settling on the figure who often appeared with him on the campaign trail, citing Bessent's expertise before rally crowds, specifically the notion that stocks were on the rise because of the prospects of a Trump victory.\nTrump described Bessent's mission Friday as one to help \"usher in a new Golden Era for the United States,\" including the stopping of trade imbalances.\nBessent is currently the CEO of Key Square Capital Management and made a notably public case for the job since Trump's victory.\nAt various points in recent weeks, Bessent was live on the set of Fox and Friends offering \"any way I can help,\" and appearing with Trump ally Steve Bannon to discuss his vision for the US economy.\nHe also published op-eds in the Wall Street Journal and on FoxNews.com to discuss issues close to the president-elect.\nBessent has also donated more than $3.1 million to Trump and other Republicans during the recent election season, according to government records.\nEvercore ISI in a note to clients this week called Bessent \"the investor favorite given his knowledge of macro and markets and his credibility with the bond market.\"\nDuring Trump's first term, the Treasury secretary role was a rare area of relative stability and persistent influence throughout the term, with Steven Mnuchin holding the post for Trump's entire term even as turnover at the White House and other Cabinet agencies was rampant.\nMnuchin, who was succeeded by current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, also found himself at the center of an array of issues, notably the negotiations that led to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nMany provisions of that law expire at the end of 2025, leaving Bessent to likely assume a central role on the same issue.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how U.S. policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "date": "2024-10-28T19:55:27.000Z",
        "article_content": "Donald Trump on Friday slammed a Biden-era accomplishment that aims to use government powers to revitalize the semiconductor industry, telling podcaster Joe Rogan \"that chips deal is so bad.\"\nVice President Kamala Harris and her campaign then launched an effort to remind voters that billions from that 2022 legislation cited by Trump are headed to swing states — specifically Michigan and Arizona.\nOn Monday, Harris swung by a Michigan facility run by a company that is set to receive $325 million from the law, formally known as the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act.\nOf Trump's remarks and the law, Harris said after a tour of the plant, \"That's billions of dollars investing in just the kind of work that is happening here.\"\nShe added to the assembled workers, \"you are a source of my optimism.\"\nThe vice president met with workers and toured Corning Inc.’s (GLW) Hemlock Semiconductor facility, located near Saginaw, alongside Michigan Rep. Dan Kildee and Corning chairman and CEO Wendell Weeks.\nThis back-and-forth between Harris and Trump is just the latest example of a divide between the two candidates, who both express a fervent desire to spur manufacturing but offer very different ways to accomplish it.\nHarris has pinned her re-industrialization strategy on using government levers to encourage specific sectors. It's an approach that uses Biden-era accomplishments like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, new green energy credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act as models.\nShe also reiterated this approach Monday, telling reporters traveling with her that \"my plan includes what we will do to continue to invest in American-based industry, American manufacturing, and American workers.\"\nFormer President Trump, by contrast, has said that a combination of new protective tariffs alongside other measures like lower corporate taxes and fewer regulations is the better means to spur factory building.\n\"When I see us paying a lot of money to have people build chips, that's not the way,\" Trump told Rogan. \"You didn't have to put up $0.10, you could have done it with a series of tariffs.\"\nAllies of Harris have long pointed to a boom in US factory construction under Biden, which was absent under Trump, as evidence that their approach is best.\nIn his remarks, Trump also mischaracterized many aspects of the 2022 law. He suggested that the bill offers loans (the main program offers grants) and implied that companies aren't putting up their own money.\nIn fact, many of the grants are predicated on company investments; the Commerce Department said that $36 billion in proposed funding so far has helped catalyze over $400 billion in investments from the companies themselves.\nTrump also somewhat confusingly said, \"They're not going to give us the good companies anyway,\" when nearly every major global chipmaker, from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to Intel (INTC) to Samsung (005930.KS) to Micron (MU), has received notifications of billion-dollar-plus awards.\nBut perhaps the most relevant detail for the Harris campaign this week, at least, is how many of these companies are setting up camp in politically important states.\nThe crucial swing state of Arizona, where the latest polls show a slim Trump lead, has positioned itself as a leader in the large US attempt to regrow a domestic chips manufacturing industry, with factories from both TSMC and Intel in the works around Phoenix.\nArizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who helped write and pass the bill, was quick to slam Trump's comment in a statement Saturday, saying, \"Donald Trump wants to throw thousands of Arizonans out of work, kneecap our state's economic future, and replace these critical investments with tariffs that will raise the costs of families by almost $4,000 ... a year.\"\nLikewise, Michigan, where Harris traveled Monday, was a trip in part to visit a smaller manufacturer there that makes materials for semiconductors.\n\"Bravo, this is fantastic,\" Harris said during her tour — of both the process of making polysilicon and an expansion planned in solar wafer manufacturing happening at the Saginaw site.\n\"Polysilicon is the bedrock of semiconductors, and it's important we have a reliable source of this material to manufacture the chips that help support our economic and national security,\" Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said recently in announcing the award.\nAll told, according to the Commerce Department, the chips manufacturing program is expected to help create over 125,000 jobs and has spread funding across 20 states so far.\nThat means Trump's comments could also reverberate in states like Ohio (where Intel is also setting up shop) and Texas (Samsung) that aren't on the presidential map but have crucial Senate contests.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how U.S. policy and government affects your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "title": "5 More Trump Stocks to Trade",
        "date": "2024-11-17T17:00:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "Tom Yeung here with your Sunday Digest.\nLast week, I recommended five stocks to buy in 2025 on a Donald Trump election victory. The president-elect is known for his clear intentions, and his second term promises even more of what we saw during his first 2016-2020 go-around. (I realize some of you will love this idea, while others will not.)\nTo ride this wave, I shared five stocks that focused on his people (Tesla), his oil & gas ambitions (Kinder Morgan, Halliburton), and companies that would do well under fewer cryptocurrency regulations (Coinbase Global, Robinhood Markets). These areas performed marvelously during his first term, and are in pole position to outperform over the coming year.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nHowever, these five stocks are admittedly volatile. Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) opened as much as 20% higher the day after I recommended the stock before settling at a 4% gain. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) rose 8% before ending flat for the week. That makes a buy-and-hold strategy 100% necessary, since only time can smooth out these lumps.\nThat’s not ideal for many investors, especially those who prefer shorter-term trades to make consistent cash. Americans have bills to pay… and the cost of necessities from healthcare to housing is outpacing income growth. \nThat’s why quant investing legend and InvestorPlace Senior Analyst Louis Navellier is hosting a special presentation, where he discusses how he’s helped people generate income streams of $40,000… $50,000… even $60,000 a year. \nHe’s calling this the “Quantum Cash Project” and he’s used it to identify fast-moving, cash-producing trades this year on firms like:\nYPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF) for a 187% gain.\nCECO Environmental Corp. (CECO) for a 135% gain.\nAnd Builders FirstSource Inc. (BLDR) for a 95% gain.\nYou can check that presentation out here.\nIn the meantime, I’ve been allowed to share three of the Quantum Cash system’s picks with you. These are firms that we expect will rise over the next one to three months… and that have lower volatility profiles to make it easier to lock in short-term gains.\nIn 2023, shares of Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) rose 44% as affluent Americans “traded down” their shopping habits to sidestep inflation. Even though GDP numbers were rising, Americans simply did not feel good. The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index sagged below 70, well below its long-term average of 85.\nDonald Trump’s election is quickly changing that sentiment among his rural constituents. Step into any small-town bar, and there’s a new sense of energy… of optimism… of hope that America is on track to being great again. (As a side note, the opposite is happening in more urban areas.)\nNowhere is this clearer than at Texas Roadhouse Inc. (TXRH), the owner of its eponymous steak house chain. Whereas restaurant chains like Red Lobster and TGI Fridays are going bankrupt, my Southern friends observe that Texas Roadhouse locations are seeing unprecedented foot traffic. Even locations in the suburban Northeast (where I live) seem to fill up early and stay crowded through the night. \nThe company has managed to capture the energy of Trump’s election victory.\nAnalysts are also modeling an improvement in fortunes. Over the past 30 days, analysts have nudged their 2025 earnings estimates another 4%, bringing their total year-to-date revisions to 19%.\nThat’s a strong sign for future gains, as Louis’s Quantum Cash Project system has shown. Upward analyst revisions are one of the best indicators of improving fortunes, and Texas Roadhouse falls squarely in the camp.\nOf course, restaurants remain a difficult business over the long term. Few full-service restaurant chains survive more than 20 years, and even formerly popular chains like Lone Star Steakhouse can be mismanaged out of existence. (Only fast-food companies seem to avoid this generational fate.)\nTexas Roadhouse will eventually lose its luster and be replaced with newer competitors. But over the next several months, don’t be surprised if this newfound feeling of optimism among its customers turns into very real profits.\nUtility equipment maker Valmont Industries Inc. (VMI) is a stable earner thanks to its quality products, wide service network, and a general unwillingness by utility companies to use lower-grade equipment. Many of Valmont’s products involve large structures that must withstand high wind speeds, heavy ice loads, and high voltages. So, customers often pay higher prices to offset the risk of catastrophic failure.\nDonald Trump’s 2016 win put VMI on a faster growth track. During the election in 2016, Valmont traded in the $130 range. Within two months, shares of VMI had moved into the $140 range. And by the end of Trump’s first year in office, VMI had risen into the $160s. \nEven though no major infrastructure bill passed during Trump’s first term, his constant focus on “Infrastructure Week” was enough to drive expectations higher.\nThe fundamentals this time around are even better. Many of Trump’s plans involve building out more infrastructure, especially transmission lines to help AI-focused data centers get set up. Telecom companies are also beginning to invest more into aging wireless networks.\nValmont’s earnings forecasts have consequently begun to rise. Analysts have pushed their 2025 earnings per share estimates up another 2%, bringing their year-to-date upgrades to 10% – a significant amount for an ordinarily stable firm.\nThat should lead to more short-term gains as markets catch up to these rosier expectations. And if President Trump begins to talk up “Infrastructure Week” again, then shares could have as much as 20% upside as investors rush in.\nAnd indeed, Louis’s Quantum Cash Project system is bullish on this conservative pick.\nShares of the New York Times Co. (NYT) traded flat in the year leading up to the 2016 election. Though record amounts of advertising dollars were spent by political campaigns, these sums largely went to TV and online ads. Advertising revenues at NYT declined 9% that year.\nThe newspaper’s fortunes quickly changed in 2017 after Donald Trump became president. The 45th president triggered a constant deluge of news, and companies like the Times profited handsomely by reporting on every detail. Subscription revenues surged 14.5% that year, as digital subscribers piled in.\n“This was a strikingly successful year for The New York Times Co.,” CEO Mark Thompson reflected in his Q4 earnings call the following year. “Our newsroom and opinion departments did brilliant work, with coverage of the new Trump administration front and center… And in 2017, [our high-quality journalism] paid off for our tens of millions of users and for the company itself.”\nShares of the New York Times rose 40%.\nLouis’s Quantum Cash Project system sees a similar probability of gains this time around. Analysts have nudged up their 2025 earnings estimates another 1% since the election, adding to their 34% upward revisions since 2023. This suggests that NYT shares should rise in the coming one to three months.\nThe fundamentals support this view. The president-elect is already reaccelerating the news cycle, creating content for the New York Times to cover. As of writing, we’ve seen Donald Trump name Elon Musk to co-lead a “Department of Government Efficiency” task force… name controversial congressman Matt Gaetz as the next Attorney General… and choose a Fox News host to be the next Secretary of Defense.\nThese are choices the New York Times editorial board has called “reckless” and “irresponsible.” And whether or not you agree with such statements, enough Times fans certainly do.\nIn addition, the Times will likely see an influx of new subscribers leaving The Washington Post. The D.C.-based newspaper recently lost at least 250,000 subscribers (about 10% of its total) after refusing to endorse a presidential candidate for the 2024 election. Meanwhile, The New York Times had no trouble endorsing Kamala Harris as “the only patriotic choice for president” in September. \nMuch like my previous recommendation of Fox Corp. (FOXA) – up 13% since then – some companies are destined to succeed when controversy saturates the news.\nIn late 2023, America experienced a “melt-up” rally where stock prices rose far faster than their underlying earnings. For months, it felt like investors could do no wrong.\nThe bonanza eventually ended in July 2024, when large tech companies started reporting worse-than-expected earnings. The Nasdaq Composite index slumped 13%, and former high-flying stocks like Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) dropped as much as 27%.\nFlat-footed investors were totally caught off guard.\nWe’re now facing a new melt-up rally with Donald Trump’s election win. Shares of tech stocks have rallied 5% since November 5, and speculative plays like Bitcoin (BTC) have surged by a third. Dogecoin (DOGE) – a poster child of too much money chasing risky assets – has more than doubled since the election.\nPlus, more tailwinds are on the horizon. The Federal Reserve is set to cut interest rates another 25 basis points over the next two months… the “Santa Claus rally” is around the corner… and the “January effect” right after that…\nWhat can possibly go wrong?\nAs Louis Navellier will show in his special presentation, now is not the time to get careless. Though Trump’s election last week acted as a huge catalyst for stocks, there’s only so much that the Trump Boom can bring. Investors still need cash and income for the next four years, and there will be selloffs along the way.\nTo navigate this, Louis is talking about his Quantum Cash Project, a stock grading system that identifies stocks ripe for short-term gains, which can then be treated like income.\nFor example, an initial $7,500 investment in past recommendations paid out a $3,375 windfall in a one-month timeframe… $4,650 in three months… $11,925 in five months… and $16,875 in 11 months…\nAnd his Quantum Cash Project is designed to identify payout opportunities regardless of economic uncertainty, persistent risks of inflation, or any market condition.\nIn his recent presentation, Louis introduces this income-generating approach that he projects will identify at least $60,000 in potential income opportunities over the next 12 months.\nThe system requires no special skills, employs no risky leverage, and can generate income whether you’re working or retired.\nTo learn more about this tested strategy and how it works, click here to watch Louis’s special presentation.\nAnd I’ll see you back here next Sunday.\nRegards,\nThomas Yeung\nMarkets Analyst, InvestorPlace\nThomas Yeung is a market analyst and portfolio manager of the Omnia Portfolio, the highest-tier subscription at InvestorPlace.

        "date": "2024-11-25T15:42:04.000Z",
        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nUPDATE 11/25: Gibson has confirmed to Guitar World that it has issued a cease and desist order to Trump Guitars owner 16 Creative over the use of its single-cut electric guitar model, “as the design infringes upon Gibson’s exclusive trademarks, particularly the iconic Les Paul body shape.”\nThis is a developing story and we will share a full statement as we have it, but for now here’s everything we do know about the burgeoning Trump Guitars line...\nThe incoming 47th American President has endorsed a series of guitars – a new official addition to his growing portfolio of merchandise.\nTrump Guitars is not thought to be owned directly by the President-elect, but its electric model is being pitched as “the only guitar officially endorsed by President Donald J. Trump”.\nThe launch includes a small selection of Les Paul-style electric guitars, and acoustic guitars split into several categories, with signed editions, limited to 275 pieces, priced at upwards of $10,000.\nThe Trump Guitars site indicates the guitar brand is owned by 16 Creative (pitched as a \"veteran owned, multi-focused branding agency”) and says that the instruments are “custom designed and developed by a veteran-owned company with the help of a master luthier”.\nThere is also a mention of parts being supplied by “multiple providers” that are “both domestic and international,” so it’s possible the guitars are not made in the USA.\nEither way, it seems early days for the venture, with caveats that some listing images are digitally rendered “for illustration purposes only” and that “all sales are final”, though guitars damaged in transit are eligible for a refund.\nThe President-elect is pictured on the site holding an electric from the American Eagle series, which sees a bold eagle and flag design emblazoned on its body and also features 'Make America Great Again' inlays.\nBlack, Gold, and Red colorways of the LP-like models are available for $1,500 apiece as part of the Presidential Series and feature two humbuckers and spell his name out with their inlays.\nThe electrics feature mahogany bodies and necks and 22-fret rosewood fingerboards. Like official Les Paul guitars, they feature two Volume and two Tone controls for their Maga '45 'buckers, though unlike a traditional Les Paul-style construction it is a bolt-on neck.\nNo specific details are mentioned regarding their scale length – they're 39\" top-to-bottom – or the rest of the hardware, like the bridge and tuners.\nTwo acoustic guitars make up the God Bless The USA models and pair spruce, sapele, mahogany, and rosewood with D-shape cutaways and ABS nuts and saddles.Whether these are intended as display-only ‘wall-hangers’ or player-grade models is not clear from the marketing.\nRegardless, it is the Trump Guitars electric design – notably, its striking resemblance to the Gibson Les Paul – that has drawn the most attention from guitar fans.\nIn recent years, Gibson has staunchly defended its intellectual property. For instance, it remains embroiled in a long-standing lawsuit with Dean over its usage of V and Z-shaped guitar designs and the Futura headstock.\nAs a result, questions quickly arose from guitarists as to how the firm will react to Trump Guitars’ offerings, given the potential political implications if it were to take legal action.\nGuitar World approached Gibson to ask whether it considers the design to infringe upon its intellectual property and was told: “We can confirm a cease and desist has been issued against 16 Creative as the design infringes upon Gibson’s exclusive trademarks, particularly the iconic Les Paul body shape.”\nMeanwhile, it is still not confirmed whether or not the President-elect actually plays guitar, but there have been previous crossovers with the six-string world.\nLast summer, eagle eyed players spotted a Gibson guitar case sat in storage next to classified documents at Mar-a-Lago last summer. Then there were some bizarre NFT cards that pictured Trump playing a Gibson ES-335-like guitar, complete with an “alarmingly inaccurate” whammy bar."

        "date": "2024-12-15T14:00:23.000Z",
        "article_content": "Marianne Lake runs JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) sprawling consumer banking operations, making her one of the most powerful people in the industry.\nShe is also one of the frontrunners to succeed CEO Jamie Dimon when the longtime boss decides to stop running the nation's largest bank.\nLake stepped into the spotlight this past week at Goldman Sachs (GS) financial services conference in Manhattan, giving investors a bullish update about the bank's fourth quarter performance (investment banking fees will be up 45%) and 2025 (a key revenue source will be $2 billion more than expected).\nJPMorgan's CEO of consumer and community banking told investors there were \"reasons to be optimistic\" about 2025, a sentiment that many others in her industry echoed this past week as they cheered the incoming Trump White House.\nThe hope is that lending and dealmaking churn higher while a new Republican administration loosens some rules for banks and applies more leniency in approving the sort of corporate mergers that produce big profits for Wall Street giants.\nRead more: How do banks make money?\nBanks are also hoping that a new administration would think twice about a new set of controversial capital rules proposed by top bank regulators that would require lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses.\nLake, who is 55 years old, went into more detail about her outlook in a conversation with Yahoo Finance, covering a number of topics that are front of mind for her industry.\nLake has not been shy in the past about expressing her concern with pending regulation and legislation that she and others argue will harm banks and their customers.\nAlong with the proposal that could increase bank capital requirements, she cited three specific examples this week of rules or legislation that are of concern.\nOne reduces debit card fees, one reduces debit card interchange fees, and one makes it simpler for customers to transfer their personal data between banks.\nThe day after she spoke, the Biden administration released another new rule opposed by banks: a $5 cap on bank overdraft charges imposed by the CFPB. It quickly resulted in a lawsuit from bank lobbying groups.\nShe does expect there is an opportunity with the new administration to reverse some of these proposals.\nWhen it comes to the \"onslaught of new regulatory constraints,\" Lake told Yahoo Finance, \"we’re optimistic about the opportunities for collaboration between the business community and the new administration.\"\nSome economists are worried that the policies of Trump 2.0 will prove to be inflationary, adding to persistent pricing pressures.\nLake said the bank shares the general consensus view that tariffs and trade policy will have an impact and Trump’s stance toward China will be tougher.\n\"Our central case is that it will have an impact on inflation,\" but \"it's more of a headwind than it is a derailer.\"\nThere may be \"second-order consequences\" in extra costs for consumers and on employment.\n\"But we think those will be more modest.\"\nLake sounded optimistic about the economic picture, citing the ability of the central bank to avoid a recession while bringing inflation down.\nThe Federal Reserve is expected this coming Wednesday to lower rates for the third consecutive meeting, as it shifts to an easing of monetary policy while (thus far) avoiding a recession.\n“As we sit here today, we believe that the Fed has engineered, at least possibly, a soft landing,” she told Yahoo Finance.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\"If we become more and more confident in that, and if some of the inflationary pressures or the risk to growth are somewhat modest, then I think you might see the animal spirits translate.\"\nBut she expects the longer end of rates to \"remain somewhat anchored\" into 2025, meaning homeowners may not see a ton of relief in the form of lower borrowing costs on mortgages.\n\"So it's not looking like mortgage rates are going to materially come down in the next, you know, call it 12 months, at least.

        "article_content": "BCA Research has assigned a 55% probability that Donald Trump will win the U.S. presidency in the upcoming November election, marking a contrarian stance compared to other forecasts.\nThe outlook is rooted in BCA’s analysis of the current political and economic landscape, where they believe that Trump's potential victory could lead to a full Republican sweep of both the White House and Congress. This scenario, though contested, remains BCA's “most likely” outcome.\nThe 55% probability marks a slight downgrade from an earlier 60% estimate, yet Trump remains the favored candidate in this closely contested race, according to the investment research firm.\nVice President Kamala Harris, who has recently taken over as the Democratic nominee, also presents a strong challenge, buoyed by her status as part of the incumbent party. However, BCA points out that Harris is statistically tied with Trump in key swing states, and factors such as rising unemployment and weaker polling among key demographics may hinder her chances.\n“The loss of an incumbent president advantage with Biden dropping out, the uptick in unemployment in contested states, and the lackluster polling among key demographics, lead us to maintain our view of a Trump victory in the White House, though we downgrade his odds to 55% from 60%,” BCA strategists note.\nThe firm also breaks down the likelihood of various election outcomes. Within the 55% chance of a Trump victory, they assign a 50% probability to a full Republican sweep – control of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives – and a 5% chance of Trump winning the presidency with a mixed Congress.\nIn contrast, if Harris were to win, BCA sees a 45% probability, with a higher likelihood of a Republican or mixed Congress rather than a Democratic sweep.\nShould Trump win, strategists anticipate notable economic and sectoral impacts. Trump's policies, characterized by fiscal stimulus and deregulation, are expected to be inflationary, leading to higher budget deficits and long-term inflation.\nSectors that would benefit under a Trump administration include Energy, Financials, Industrials, Materials, and Real Estate, all of which are tied to his proposed policies such as increasing domestic energy production and infrastructure investments.\nOn the other hand, defensive sectors like Health Care and Utilities are highlighted by BCA as prudent choices for investors, given the expected near-term economic slowdown and market volatility leading up to and following the election.\nBCA stresses that regardless of the election outcome, these sectors offer downside protection and are likely to outperform in the current uncertain environment.\nIt also highlights that equity returns are typically softer after a change in incumbency, as markets adjust to new policies and leadership. Historically, sectors that outperformed under the previous administration often underperform when a new party takes office, while lagging sectors may see a rebound.\nRelated Articles\nBCA assigns 55% chance that Trump will win the presidency in November\nHarris raises $540 million since launching her presidential campaign\nTrump struggles to keep media spotlight in battle with Harris"

        "article_content": "Six months ago and under the gun for roughly half a billion dollars in legal expenses, Donald Trump took on a flurry of bizarre get-rich-quick schemes to raise some capital. They included a line of NFTs featuring cartoonish images of himself dressed up as superhero characters; a line of gold, high-top sneakers that retailed for $399 a pop; and, bizarrely, his own Bible series.\nTrump pitched his God Bless the USA Bible alongside singer Lee Greenwood, the man who popularized the song it’s named after. The selling point boiled down to a callback to Trump’s campaign: “We must make America pray again.”\n“Yes, this is the only Bible endorsed by President Trump!” the site advertised.\nAnd while it’s unclear if the Trump-endorsed, $60 religious text actually made more people pray, it certainly did help line the convicted felon’s pockets. According to Trump’s latest financial disclosure, that far-flung idea actually brought in $300,000 in royalties. Those numbers could have been bolstered by an even pricier signed version, which retailed for $1,000. \nIt wasn’t the only book that Trump made some cash off of. His book Letters to Trump, which featured a letter from former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown—who disputed Trump’s claim that the two had shared a near-death experience in a helicopter together—raked in $4.5 million. One of his more recents books, A MAGA Journey, netted $505,763, while Trump’s bestseller, The Art of the Deal, managed to bring in between $50,000 and $100,000 in royalties.\nBut Trump’s other weird money streams also helped bring in some quick cash. The disclosure listed $7.15 million coming from a source labeled NFT INT., likely referring to his NFT series. And, despite having previously labeled cryptocurrency as a scam, the former president notably kept a stockpile of cash in the new-wave currencies, with the disclosure listing roughly $5 million in crypto.\nTrump listed his social media platform, Truth Social, at more than $50 million. Trump owns nearly 65 percent of Truth Social’s parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The company’s stock value has plummeted in recent days.\nStill, the disclosure couldn’t offset Trump’s legal reality: It lists more than $100 million for bonds related to three of his legal trials in New York."

        "title": "Is the Stock Market Going to Crash Under President-Elect Donald Trump? Here's What History Has to Say.",
        "date": "2024-12-12T09:51:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "November was a busy month for Wall Street. It represented the heart of earnings season for many of the most-influential businesses in America, and featured key economic reports that'll shape the Fed's monetary policy in the coming quarters.\nBut perhaps most importantly, November provided resolution to the all-important question of, \"Who will lead America forward over the next four years?\" Shortly after the polls closed on Election Night, the Associated Press declared former President Donald Trump as the new president-elect.\nThe stock market soared during Trump's first term in the White House, with the mature stock-powered Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) respectively rising by 57%, 70%, and 142%.\nBut to quote Wall Street's favorite disclaimer: \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\"\nWith the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite soaring to uncharted territory since Election Day, it's raising questions about the validity of the current bull market rally and whether a stock market crash awaits President-elect Trump.\nAs is the case following every major election, there are more questions than answers when it comes to what policies the Trump administration will be able to put into action, as well as what impact those policies might have on the U.S. economy and/or stock market. While having a unified government — Republicans hold a majority of seats in both houses of Congress — should, on paper, help Trump pass key pieces of legislation, the GOP majority in the House is narrow enough that this is far from a guarantee.\nPerhaps the biggest policy concern pertains to President-elect Trump's desire to impose tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. He recently laid out a plan to implement 25% import tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico on Day One, as well as 35% on imports from China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product (GDP).\nThe purpose of tariffs is to encourage domestic manufacturing and to make homemade goods more price-competitive with those brought in from overseas markets. But tariffs run the risk of increasing prices for businesses and consumers and reigniting the prevailing rate of inflation. With the nation's central bank currently in a rate-easing cycle, this could position the U.S. economy for a period of stagflation if the prevailing inflation rate were to meaningfully pick back up.\nThere's also some level of worry about national debt. With the exception of 1998 through 2001, the federal government has spent more than it's brought in every year since 1970. The pace at which national debt is climbing isn't sustainable over the long run.\nWhile Republicans have traditionally looked for ways to reduce federal spending, Trump's plan also aims to reduce corporate and/or personal income tax rates. Though an even lower corporate income tax rate would likely spur share repurchase activity, it runs the risk of further widening the federal deficit.\nBut rather than focusing on the \"what-ifs?\" that follow every major election cycle, let's take a closer look at what history has to tell us about the probability of a stock market crash taking shape during Trump's second term.\nAlthough there's no definitive metric or forecasting tool that can predict sizable short-term moves in the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite with 100% accuracy, there are a number of correlative events and data points that have very strongly correlated with big moves higher or lower in the broader market throughout history. A few of these metrics suggest that a short-lived stock market crash is possible with Donald Trump at the helm.\nBefore proceeding any further, let me make clear that these forecasts have nothing to do with Trump or his having won the November election. If Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris had won, we'd be having the exact same discussion with the same historic data points and parameters.\nWith the above being said, Donald Trump is inheriting one of the priciest stock markets in history — and that's a big problem.\nWhen the closing bell tolled on Dec. 6, the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) Ratio, which is also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E ratio (CAPE Ratio), sat at 38.89. This is more than double its average multiple of 17.17 dating back to the start of 1871.\nHowever, the bigger concern is what's happened previously when stock valuations become extended to the upside. The 38.89 reading is the third-highest during a continuous bull market spanning 153 years. The only two times Wall Street has been pricier — prior to the dot-com bubble (Shiller P/E of 44.19 in December 1999) and in late 2021/early 2022 (the Shiller P/E briefly topped 40) — led to eye-popping declines in the major indexes.\nAfter the dot-com bubble peak, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gave back 49% and 78% of their respective value. Meanwhile, the 2022 bear market shaved more than 20% off the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite at their respective troughs.\nThe so-called \"Buffett Indicator,\" named for Warren Buffett's then-favorite valuation tool in 2001, is also at an all-time high. This valuation measure divides the cumulative market cap of public companies into U.S. GDP. Since 1970, the Buffett Indicator has averaged a ratio of 85% — i.e., the aggregate value of public companies equals about 85% the value of U.S. GDP. Last week, the Buffett Indicator topped 208%.\nBy historic measures, the stock market looks to be headed for a short but sizable correction, if not crash, at some point in the not-too-distant future.\nBut the great thing about history is that the pendulum swings in both directions. Even though select valuation metrics foreshadow trouble for Wall Street and suggest Trump will oversee a sizable decline in the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite while in office, a wider-lens view tells a completely different story.\nIn June 2023, the analysts at Bespoke Investment Group posted a data set on social media platform X that examined that average length of every bear and bull market in the S&P 500 dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. All told, there have been 27 separate bear and bull markets spanning 94 years (through June 2023).\nBespoke's data set shows the average S&P 500 bear market lingers for only 286 calendar days, or roughly 9.5 months. Further, seven out of 27 bear markets hit their respective nadirs in 101 or fewer days.\nBy comparison, the typical S&P 500 bull market has endured for 1,011 calendar days, which is approximately 3.5 times longer than the average S&P 500 bear market. Additionally, more than half (14 out of 27) of the bull markets have stuck around longer than the lengthiest bear market (630 calendar days). Simply being patient has allowed investors to grow their wealth on Wall Street over time.\nTo add, Wall Street has historically done very well when Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress. From 1926 through 2023, there have been 13 years with a unified Republican government, and the S&P 500 has averaged a hearty 14.52% annual return in those years, based on data from Retirement Researcher.\nTo be fair, the stock market does well no matter how you arrange the political puzzle pieces, with positive average annual returns in every scenario. But with the exception of a Democratic president and divided Congress, a unified Republican government has delivered the highest average annual returns spanning almost a century.\nEven if a short-lived crash occurs during President-elect Trump's second term, history suggests it'll mark a phenomenal opportunity for patient investors.\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

        "article_content": "Billionaires from coast to coast are putting their influence and money behind Donald Trump, a wave of support that is helping the former president narrow his fundraising gap with President Joe Biden and seize new momentum in his race for the White House.\nSome have already donated millions to his campaign, some have announced plans to do so, and some are only saying for now that they will vote for him.\nTrump, meanwhile, is returning the favor.\nHe is reportedly promising to make policy changes that would help their businesses and perhaps even rely on them as advisers if he returns to the White House. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Trump and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk have discussed a formal advisory role for the billionaire if Trump should win.\nThe close back-and-forth with billionaires is a notable departure from Trump’s previous Oval Office runs that often focused more on smaller contributors. The website OpenSecrets tracks donations by size and found that \"large contributions\" made up about 14% of Trump’s bankroll in 2016. That same figure this time around is more than 68%.\nThe latest example of elite support came last week with the news that Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, after years of keeping his distance from Trump, is now a supporter.\nThe financier told Axios he's supporting Trump and will donate to him as a \"vote for change.\"\nHe is just the latest wealthy donor to overcome past objections to Trump's conduct and character. Schwarzman responded to the events of Jan. 6, 2021, by saying at the time that the \"insurrection that followed the president's remarks today is appalling.\"\nThe flip in GOP donor support to Trump comes after many billionaires tried to boost his Republican rivals, especially Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.\nBut that quickly changed after the primary season ended.\nHaley ended her run in March and Trump then outraised Biden in April. That was largely due to a single event featuring an assortment of billionaires at hedge fund manager John Paulson's home in Palm Beach, Fla.\nThe event raised more than $50 million in a single night.\nIn total, Trump raised about $76 million in April, besting Biden's $51 million. But Biden is still ahead when it comes to cash in the bank, with $192 million saved across his operation.\nA collection of familiar GOP names announced their support for Trump in recent months, in addition to Schwarzman. They include figures like hotel tycoon Robert Bigelow and activist investor Nelson Peltz.\nBoth have donated to Republicans for years. Both distanced themselves from Trump after Jan. 6. Both are now back on board.\nRobert Bigelow, the billionaire owner of Budget Suites of America and founder of Bigelow Aerospace, previously backed DeSantis, but he has since made plans to give over $20 million to Trump.\nHe also reportedly co-chaired the recent fundraiser at Paulson's Florida home.\nFor his part, Peltz told the FT earlier this month he would vote for Trump, but donations may or may not be forthcoming. \"I'm not happy about that,\" he told the paper, saying he still had misgivings about Trump but that they were outweighed by his concerns about Biden's fitness for office.\nPeltz — who recently lost a high-profile proxy battle with Disney (DIS) and its CEO Bob Iger — donated to Sen. Tim Scott during the presidential primary season.\nPeltz supported Trump financially and with his vote in 2020 but said on CNBC on Jan. 7, 2021, he was \"sorry I did that.\"\nSome traditional GOP megadonors are still holding out, at least for now.\nBillionaire hedge-fund investor Kenneth Griffin told attendees at the Qatar Economic Forum earlier this month that he wants to see who Trump picks as his running mate first.\nPeter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal who has long bankrolled GOP campaigns, told the Atlantic late last year he wouldn't be giving any money to Trump or anyone else during this presidential campaign.\nTrump has also received support from wealthy energy executives after what appears to be a concerted outreach effort to that industry.\nTrump has reportedly made direct appeals for donations in return for looser restrictions on things like oil drilling if he wins.\nThat outreach may have pushed the limits of campaign finance laws, according to the Washington Post, with Senate Democrats promising to investigate.\nTrump and the industry are \"conferring on how to trade campaign cash for policy changes,\" said Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden in a recent statement. \"Such potential abuses must be scrutinized.\"\nBut the promises appear to have allowed Trump inroads with oil executives.\nHarold Hamm, the founder and chairman of oil and natural gas company Continental Resources, has increased his alliance with Trump in recent months.\nFederal Election Commission (FEC) data shows a contribution of $614,000 from Hamm to Trump's joint fundraising committee at the end of March.\nHamm had a relationship with Trump that stretched back for years, but he distanced himself after 2020 and gave money to Haley as recently as last year.\nPerhaps the most surprising source of potential billionaire support for Trump comes in traditionally deep-blue Silicon Valley.\nMultiple recent reports from The New York Times to Puck have chronicled ongoing efforts from venture capitalist David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital to organize a fundraiser on Mr. Trump's behalf.\nWhether the fundraiser — and a possible appearance on the pair's podcast—eventually comes together remains to be seen. But the news was especially notable given the long history the two men have of donating to Democrats.\nPalihapitiya gave Biden more than $250,000 during the 2020 campaign, according to FEC data.\nOther prominent figures like Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz and Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital, have lambasted Biden on their social media feeds but, as of yet, have declined to get behind Trump.\nAnother closely watched figure is Musk. The current third-richest man in the world has unleashed an onslaught of anti-Biden commentary online this year and says he can't imagine voting for Biden this fall.\nThe trend comes after years of Musk's deepening ties with Republicans. A new Wall Street Journal report this week demonstrated the increasingly warm relationship between Trump and Musk after Musk posted in 2022 that Trump should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\"\nMusk met with Trump in March and, according to the report, now talks with Trump several times a month. The two men have even reportedly discussed giving Musk a formal advisory role on border security, an issue Musk is keenly focused on, as well as on the economy.\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Musk stays true to a promise he made in March when he posted, \"I am not donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "article_content": "New comments from former President Donald Trump are turning up the political pressure on the Federal Reserve as policy makers make it clear they are getting closer to cutting interest rates.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg published Tuesday night, the Republican nominee again reiterated that central bank officials should not ease monetary policy before the November election.\n\"It’s something that they know they shouldn’t be doing,\" he said.\nBut Fed officials — including Fed Governor Chris Waller in a new speech Wednesday titled \"Getting Closer\" — are suggesting that the time for cuts is in fact drawing near.\n\"While I don’t believe we have reached our final destination, I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted,\" Waller said in his speech at the Kansas City Federal Reserve.\nEvidence is mounting that disappointing inflation data in the first three months of the year may have been an \"aberration,\" Waller added, and that inflation data so far from the second quarter show steady progress toward the Fed's goal of 2%.\n\"The effects of tighter monetary policy [may] have corralled high inflation,\" he said.\nNew York Fed President John Williams also told the Wall Street Journal Wednesday that an interest-rate cut could be warranted in the coming months — though not at the central bank’s next meeting July 30-31 — if the slowdown in inflation continues.\nMarkets are currently betting the central bank will cut rates in September, just seven weeks before Election Day. Traders are pricing in a more than 90% chance of that happening, up from 70% just a few weeks ago.\nA September rate cut could cause the central bank to face political criticism not just from Trump, but also from Republican and Democratic lawmakers.\nLawmakers from both parties signaled last week during Congressional testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell they would criticize the central bank if this key September decision doesn't go their way.\nIf Powell and his colleagues choose to keep rates at a 23-year high, a growing chorus of Democratic critics calling for cuts may reach a crescendo. But if policymakers do indeed cut, Republicans from Trump on down will be sure to cast the move as caving to election-year pressure.\nPowell’s response to the new wave of political pressure was to echo an independent, apolitical approach he has honed throughout 2024, emphasizing that the only criteria that matters to him is data on prices and jobs.\n\"This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed, and I can tell you we come to work the next day and do our jobs,\" Powell said.\nHe made the same point this past Monday during an interview at the Economic Club of Washington.\nBut the Fed chair also signaled that the time for cuts is getting closer, citing a recent turnaround in inflation readings following hotter-than-expected data in the first quarter, including the release last Thursday of encouraging numbers from the Consumer Price Index for the month of June.\nThe Consumer Price Index on a \"core\" basis — which excludes volatile food and energy prices the Fed can’t control — rose 3.3% year over year in the month of June. That was down from 3.4% in May and 3.6% in April.\nThe Fed gets a new June reading from its preferred inflation gauge — the \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures Index — on July 26.\nPowell was asked Monday if he intended to stay through the end of his term as chair in May 2026, and he gave a one-word answer: \"Yes.\"\nWhen asked if he would stay longer should he be reappointed as chair, he said, \"I have nothing on that for you today.\"\nPowell's full term as a member of the Fed's board of governors doesn't end until Jan. 31, 2028.\nTrump in his Bloomberg interview said \"I would let him serve it out,\" and added: \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"\nStephen Moore, a top Trump confidant, said during an appearance this week on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast that when Powell's term expires \"then we would look for someone new, maybe a Judy Shelton or a Larry Kudlow or an Arthur Laffer or somebody who's more in line with his economic philosophy.\"\n\"And I think that like makes a lot of sense.\"\nWaller, the Fed governor, laid out a couple scenarios on Wednesday that could lead to a rate cut — an optimistic one and a more likely one.\nIn the optimistic scenario the Fed continues to get more favorable inflation reports consistently. In that scenario Waller said he could envision “a rate cut in the not-too-distant future.”\nIn what he deems the more likely scenario, inflation data comes in uneven — not as good as the previous few months — but still consistent overall with progress on bringing inflation down toward 2%.\nIn that case \"it would be a matter of timing as to when I thought we are making sustainable progress to 2 percent inflation. In this case, a rate cut in the near future is more uncertain.\"\nWhile the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge has been running near 2 percent at an annual rate recently, he said he needs to see more evidence that it will be sustained.\nWaller also said he believes current data are consistent with the US economy achieving a soft landing, and will be looking for data over the next couple months to confirm that.\nThe job market, he said, is in a sweet spot and that things are loosening rather than weakening.\nBut there is more upside risk to unemployment than “we have seen for a long time,” noting that a continued drop in job vacancies could lead to a larger increase in unemployment.\nWaller was also asked Wednesday about his reaction to the Republican ticket in 2024, including Vice President nominee JD Vance.\n\"Politics is politics,\" he said. \"That's not my job. My job is to look at the economy and react to it and make my best decisions to achieve the dual mandate that Congress gave me. So like I tell everybody, whatever happens in the political world, I just have to take that as a given and then make the best policy I can from that.\"\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "title": "Donald Trump doubles down on his tariff ideas before New York business leaders",
        "date": "2024-09-05T19:21:49.000Z",
        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump sought to offer a more detailed economic message in a speech Thursday in New York — and paid special attention to his oft-criticized program for a new wave of tariffs on US imports from around the world.\n“Some might call it economic nationalism, I call it common sense,\" Trump told the crowd of business leaders at the Economic Club of New York.\nHe also declined to offer exact rates, but seemed to suggest that if he were elected he could even implement higher duties than he has previously discussed. “I won't name the percentage today but it will be a certain tariff percentage which will be higher than people had heard in the past,” Trump added Thursday.\nTrump has previously proposed to levy tariffs of 10% to 20% on US trading partners with higher 60% rates on China. It's a plan that economists have been worried for months could spur inflation anew.\nThe former president also offered a wide array of other ideas in the nearly 80-minute speech and question and answer session.\nHis other proposals unveiled Thursday included an endorsement of a government efficiency commission first recommended by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, a new effort to cut government red tape, a decrease in the federal corporate tax rate to 15% from its current level of 21%, a declaration of a “national emergency” to spur more oil drilling, and the rescinding of certain unspent green energy funds passed in Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.\nBut it was when the subject turned to tariffs that Trump became the most clearly animated as he defended his long-term priority first undertaken during his previous time in the White House.\nHe returned to the topic again and again to push back on his critics.\n“Smart tariffs will not create inflation, they will combat inflation,” he said at one point in an attempt to push back on one oft-lodged critique of his plan. Trump and his allies often note that inflation was low when he was in office from 2017-2021 as he implemented that era's tariffs.\nTrump aides also underlined that a reelected Trump could be eager to implement these ideas quickly, likely without input from Congress.\n“There certainly is a lot of current law that permits tariffs to be put in place in various circumstances,” former Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters ahead of the speech.\n\"We saw that during our last administration and I suspect you will see some kind of a combination of both this time too.\"\nLighthizer and other Trump allies have previously discussed different laws to get his tariffs done quickly in 2025 and at higher levels than his previous term if he wins. One previously unutilized option is a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to declare an economic emergency and act accordingly.\nThe deep dive into the trade topic from Trump comes as the business community's wariness of his plans continues to be a notable headwind for the president.\nA new research note from Goldman Sachs underlined the worries this week when it found that — at least when it comes to the gross domestic product — a Kamala Harris win with a Democrat sweep of Congress is the best outcome for economic growth.\nThe analysts wrote that Harris in the White House could lead to “a very slight boost to GDP growth on average over 2025-2026.” But Trump victory scenarios would hit the GDP in large part because of a ”hit to growth from tariffs.”\nTrump aides have dismissed the Goldman Sachs analysis as overly influenced by politics but it’s just the latest study that underlines the possible costs of Trump’s new tariff plans, which are duties levied on companies when their goods arrive at US ports of entry.\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics has run the numbers and found that Trump's ideas for 60% duties on China and 10% on other trading partners would lead to a typical middle-class household paying at least $1,700 more each year.\nAnother estimate from Brendan Duke of the left-leaning Center for American Progress comes in even higher. He found that a 20% tariff combined with 60% on Chinese goods could mean an additional cost of $3,900 for a typical family each year.\nThat latter stat is one that Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign have highlighted again and again in recent weeks, comparing it to a national sales tax.\nYet, Trump again and again returned to the tariff topic during Wednesday’s speech as a linchpin of his potential second-term agenda.\nHe said the tariffs could bring in billions and reduce deficits. He said they would help rebuild the US auto industry. At one point, he also expressed nostalgia for a long-ago era when tariffs were a main driver of US revenue “before income tax came along.”\n\"In short, it will be an economic renaissance,\" he promised of what a second round of trade wars would usher in.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "date": "2024-11-15T19:00:39.000Z",
        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump confronts a number of geopolitical challenges as he returns to the White House, including managing the US-China relationship, a potential escalation in the Middle East, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.\n“I think the reality is we are probably in one of the biggest periods of geopolitical uncertainty and instability we have seen in our lifetimes,” Brian Schimpf, co-founder and CEO of defense tech company Anduril Industries, said at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference.\n\"For a Trump administration, the most important thing is to recognize the degree to which American leadership on this still really matters,\" Schimpf added, \"and a lot of that is going to come from the fact that we have the strongest and best military.\"\nOne issue for investors to consider is how the American defense technology industry could evolve under a new administration.\nThere are two kinds of companies producing America's defense technology today. There are the “primes” — well-established defense giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), RTX (RTX), and Northrop Grumman (NOC) — and there are the high-profile and fast-moving startups such as Anduril, which boasts 4,000 employees and a valuation of $14 billion only seven years after its founding.\nInvestors are enthusiastic about this sector. Between 2021 and mid-June of this year, venture capitalists invested $130 billion in defense tech startups, according to PitchBook.\nHow might a second Trump administration impact this industry? Schimpf said there is an opportunity for the Defense Department to reimagine how it procures military systems going forward.\n“Our view of this is let’s do what literally every free-market system has done,” he said. “Let’s just have the DOD be a better buyer. Buy the best tech. Show the entrepreneurs that if you build technology that actually works, that solves a real problem, we will actually buy it. And you have a chance to actually succeed doing that at scale.”\nThis view echoes a post made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk (TSLA), who has closely aligned himself with Trump in recent months, on social platform X. Musk responded to Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, saying it is “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” referencing the US Department of Defense and intelligence agencies.\nSchimpf’s company is built to capitalize on a belief that the future of war will be defined by relatively low-cost autonomous systems and not by high-cost, low-quantity fighter planes and aircraft carriers. Anduril has built a portfolio of such products, including counter-drone aircraft, autonomous submarines, and an autonomous security tower deployed on US military bases.\nChristopher Kirchhoff, who founded the Pentagon’s Silicon Valley office, told Yahoo Finance there is broad agreement inside the Pentagon that more resources should be shifted to the American defense tech community.\nHowever, there are political challenges. Kirchhoff noted that the Defense secretary would require strong allies inside the White House and on Capitol Hill to push forward meaningful change.\n“If you look at the amount of authority the [secretary of Defense] has, it’s actually very small,” Kirchhoff said. “Will the president actually exert leadership? Will Congress be receptive? It takes more than just the secretary to change the department.”\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "title": "Trump Triumph: 7 Stocks to Buy if Republicans Win the Election in 2024",
        "date": "2024-02-19T19:01:49.000Z",
        "article_content": "A few days ago, we discussed several stocks that could benefit from a Biden economic boom if he wins reelection in 2024. However, today I want to consider an alternative scenario – a triumph from former president Donald Trump. Given Trump’s resurgence in recent polls, I believe this outcome may be more probable than many think.\nWhile the Biden administration has overseen a robust economic recovery from the pandemic, many middle- and working-class families continue to struggle with inflation and rising costs of living. Recent foreign policy challenges have also dragged down Biden’s approval ratings, raising electability concerns given his age. With less than a year until the 2024 election, the race remains fluid. But if you think Trump could pull off a comeback victory, certain stocks are worth considering. Let’s dive in!\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) is a company developing technology and weapons products for military, law enforcement, and civilian use. Indeed, I think this is among the bestl-positioned companies to benefit from Trump’s policies, should he triumph in 2024.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nTrump has repeatedly vowed to crack down on crime, secure the southern border, and support domestic police departments. He is also likely to increase military spending substantially. This all bodes very well with respect to demand growth for Axon’s suite of body cameras, digital evidence management platforms, and non-lethal weapons.\nRecently, Axon made a savvy move to acquire Fusus, providing real-time operations software to grow the company’s total addressable market by $20 billion. The new Axon Body Workforce product line also cleverly expands Axon’s reach into commercial sectors like retail and healthcare. Under a second Trump term, I would expect significant tailwinds for both Axon’s public sector and private sector business segments.\nThe company is already executing tremendously well. Axon’s Q3 sales grew 33% and its profitability is stellar. Thus, I believe AXON stock deserves the premium it trades at, given its prospective growth prospects.\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nBaker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) is poised to benefit immensely from a Trump-led ‘America First’ agenda in the Oval Office.\nTrump has repeatedly promised to unleash America’s “drill, baby, drill” energy production potential. He is likely to reduce regulations substantially for domestic oil and gas producers, while expediting LNG export projects globally. This should translate into a surge of new business for Baker Hughes.\nWhile BKR stock has struggled amid concerns over a growth slowdown, a second Trump term could profoundly change the company’s trajectory. In the company’s core Oil Field Services and Equipment segment, Baker Hughes still managed to grow 2023 revenues by 16%, while growing its operating margins by an impressive 80 basis points.\nThus, Baker Hughes’ outlook remains cautiously optimistic. Under a Trump administration (likely unwilling to beg OPEC for more oil abroad but rather maximize our domestic production), Baker Hughes is sure to see accelerating order growth both onshore and offshore. Its LNG capabilities will also be in high demand. Trading at a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 14-times, Baker Hughes seems like a value stock ready to erupt. If Trump brings a driller’s mentality back to the White House, few companies offer more upside than Baker Hughes right now.\nSource: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\nAs one of the largest and most influential global banks, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) should perform well no matter who occupies the Oval Office. But a Trump triumph in 2024 could provide particularly positive catalysts for the mega bank.\nWhile Trump has a small personal stake in JPMorgan, this is unlikely to impact policy decisions much. Far more important is his preference for bilateral trade deals, reduced regulations, and historically low interest rates to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates actually tend to reduce bank profitability by compressing net interest margin, but can improve the debt service capacity of its customers, so it’s a double-edged sword.\nHowever, I expect a surge in lending activity under Trump’s economic vision. This revenue growth could more than offset any margin deterioration for well-run banks like JPMorgan. Trump is also likely to be less-inclined to impose restrictive regulations on banks than his predecessors. And if an unlikely systemic crisis did threaten major banks, Trump has signaled a willingness to have the Federal Reserve intervene aggressively, as it did back in 2020.\nWith its diversified business mix spanning commercial and investment banking, asset management, and other segments, JPMorgan remains an indispensable pillar of the global financial system. While Trump’s views on interest rates concern some bank investors, I believe easing regulations and deal-making will outweigh pressures on net interest margins.\nJPMorgan survived the Great Recession intact and entered the current robust economy in a position of strength. Betting against this financial powerhouse seems unwise, regardless of 2024’s electoral outcome.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nA right-leaning video platform competing with the likes of YouTube, Rumble (NASDAQ:RUM) has seen tremendous growth since Trump joined the platform after post-bans from other mainstream social media sites. The company’s stock price reflects enthusiasm around another Trump presidential term, surging 75% year-to-date.\nIf Trump wins again, Rumble should continue benefiting from expanded brand awareness and user growth as it becomes the go-to video site for conservative voices. Trump would also likely pursue policies aimed at limiting the power of other big tech companies, creating an opening for Rumble to gain market share. While profitability remains elusive for now, Rumble’s revenue growth rate has remained at triple-digit levels, as user engagement booms.\nWith $267 million in cash and almost no debt, Rumble has years of runway to grow into its valuation. I’ll admit the company’s current valuation gives me a little vertigo. But in a scenario where Trump returns and his supporters flock to Rumble en masse heading into the 2024 election, speculative upside still exists here. This could become the platform of choice for an entire political movement.\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\nAs an offshore driller operating specialized modern jack-up rigs, Borr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) would find smooth sailing under a second Trump term. With Trump promising to unleash domestic oil production, roll back regulations, and rehabilitate the wider fossil fuel industry, offshore drilling companies like Borr should have ample growth opportunities.\nThe company’s utilization rates already stand at 94% with full order books, as offshore drilling capacity remains scarce. Additionally, Borr has locked in future contracts at highly-favorable day rates as well, with upward rate momentum seeming likely to persist. Even if rates plateau, Borr is set to generate over $500 million of 2024 EBITDA, allowing for rapid de-leveraging and a continuation of capital return to shareholders. Notably, Borr also secured $82 million for three additional jack-up rigs, signaling more growth could be on the horizon.\nThat said, BORR stock trades at just 8-times 2024 estimated earnings, while analysts forecast ~30% revenue growth ahead. That’s too cheap for a quality name like this.\nSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com\nAnother premier offshore driller, Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) seems certain to prosper under a Trump administration bullish on resurrecting domestic oil production in unapologetic fashion.\nImportantly, Seadrill just won $1.1 billion in new contracts from a Brazilian giant. It’s certainly not a leap to suggest that a president promising to greenlight drilling permitting could bring a gusher of new business domestically, too.\nWith the company’s earnings per share expected to recover from its decline in the years ahead, a Trump win provides added catalysts for Seadrill. The offshore industry desperately needs drilling capacity, and Seadrill now has a clean balance sheet (and substantial share buybacks) to entice investors to continue to put capital to work in this name.\nTrading at bargain multiples relative to its potential earnings power, SDRL stock should regain its former glory if Trump throws his full weight behind offshore production. For shareholders willing to stomach commodity volatility, I believe Seadrill offers elite risk/reward here.\nSource: Ford\nAs an iconic American automaker, Ford (NYSE:F) seems poised for a comeback under a Trump presidency. Trump’s policies are likely to be much less hostile to internal combustion engine makers, focused more on improving the range of consumer choices on the market.\nRather than subsidizing EVs at the expense of traditional autos, Trump would likely let the market determine winning technologies. This levels the playing field for Ford to better compete with pure-play EV makers.\nFord’s core operations are strengthening too – its remarkable recovery since January suggests the UAW scandal is fading while momentum builds. With long-term earnings per share growth expected, Ford’s stock price appears to be severely undervalued at current levels.\nFord’s management team is already reassessing its aggressive EV push to avoid overextending the company’s balance sheet. I think this is a prudent move, and could be a timely one, if Trump wins the White House again. While EVs and hybrids remain critical to Ford’s future, Trump’s friendlier stance toward gas-powered vehicles should ease pressure on the company to abandon their EV ambitions entirely. That’s good for the company, and for the environment as well (one could argue).\nTrading at just 7-times 2024 earnings with positive catalysts mounting, Ford seems ready to rev up and regain glory. Its proud legacy deserves preservation, and President Trump’s industry-agnostic policy preference could fuel a Ford comeback.\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "date": "2024-11-01T10:00:51.000Z",
        "article_content": "I couldn’t take it anymore.\nI’ve been writing about the Trump trade, talking with people making Trump trades, and parsing the Trump trade for any hints that the 2024 presidential election is leaning one way or the other.\nFinally, I made a Trump trade of my own: A financial investment meant to capitalize on the outcome of the presidential election. I bought, with my own money, an option contract on shares of Donald Trump’s new company, Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT). I will either make money or lose money based on the outcome of the presidential election — then let all of you know which way it went, so you can cheer me on or roast me.\nI’m not a sophisticated trader. I could have simply bought shares in Trump’s company if I thought Trump was going to win or shorted those shares if I thought Trump was going to lose. But the hot trades are in options on DJT shares, which are timed bets allowing the trader to either buy or sell shares in the future at a certain price by a certain deadline. I wanted to be where the action is and learn more about what’s going on deeper in the markets than I usually go.\nI've never traded options before, so I asked Eric Hale, founder and CEO of Trader Oasis, to guide me through the process. Hale didn’t tell me what to buy. He asked me what I wanted out of the trade. He emphasized that his guidance didn’t constitute financial advice and that option betting has a binary outcome: I would either make a one-time profit or lose my investment completely.\nFrankly, he told me, this isn’t a shrewd way to spend your money.\nI said thanks for the advice, now can we figure out the trade? I take the polls at face value. Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are basically tied. I have no inside info — and I have no clue who’s going to win. So I didn’t feel strongly one way or the other about whether I should bet on a Trump win or a Harris win.\nI do think, however, that betting markets overstate Trump’s odds and that traders are placing too much emphasis on betting odds they believe to be bullish for Trump. That could be a false signal.\nJim Bianco of Bianco Research recently joined the YF Capitol Gains podcast to explain how betting markets work. At the time, betting markets gave Trump 60% odds of winning and Harris 40%. If that were a poll, Trump would have a huge lead. But Bianco explained that betting markets are probabilities, not poll margins, and anything less than 66% for Trump is the equivalent of a toss-up.\nInvestors in DJT have not been acting like the race is a toss-up. DJT, whose main product is the Truth Social app, is a pipsqueak social media company with little revenue that probably has no chance if Trump loses. Trump himself is the sole attraction on Truth Social — and if he loses in 2024, his political career will mostly be over and Truth Social will lose the only real reason for people to join. But if Trump wins, Truth Social could be a necessary destination for everybody eager to know what’s happening as Trumpworld takes over the executive branch.\nIf there were a \"Harris trade,\" I'd be looking into investing in that too. But Kamala Harris mostly represents the status quo in terms of trade, financial markets, and other things investors care about. Trump, with his plans to jack up import tariffs, deport millions of migrants, and further slash taxes, would bring the sorts of changes that disrupt markets and reprice assets.\nThe DJT share price is probably the best single indicator of whether investors think Trump is likely to win. In mid-September, they didn't, and DJT sank to around $12 per share, the lowest level since the company went public in March and closed at $58 on its first day of trading. Traders were basically guessing that Trump would lose and betting that his company would drift into oblivion. Since then, however, the stock has skyrocketed to as high as $52 on Oct. 29. On Oct. 30, the day I placed my wager, DJT closed at $40.\nMy guess is that DJT is overvalued and is likely to fall in price, possibly by a lot. So I bought a put contract with a strike price of $25 that expires on Nov. 15, 2024. An options contract typically involves 100 shares. The price of my put was $3.90 per share, or about $390 in total, for the right to sell 100 shares.\nWhat this means is that if the price of DJT stays above $25 through the time my contract expires on the close of trading on Nov. 15, I’ll be out my $390 and the trade is over. If the price goes below $25, before the contract expires, I’ll be “in the money,” as investors say.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nHale helped me estimate my possible gain at different prices. I’ll break even at the point the contract expires, on Nov. 15, if the share price falls to $21.10, at which point I will have fully recouped my $390 investment. At $15, I’ll make a net profit of at least $610. My net gain would be at least $1,110 if the price drops to $10 and at least $2,110 if the price drops to $0. My return could be greater if the price of DJT falls sooner.\nMy track record on trendy bets is lousy. In 2021, I tried my hand at meme stock trading by buying 171 shares of BlackBerry at $14.60 per share, for about $2,500 in total. If BlackBerry had taken off the way GameStop did, I could have netted $200,000. But BlackBerry had no meme left in it and I ended up losing $1,760.\nAround 2017, I bought some shares of Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage underwriter that had been in conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis. The play was that the Trump administration would privatize Fannie Mae and turn it into a real company, sending the stock higher. But the stock I bought at around $3.75 per share only went down. It now trades at around $1.40. I sold, sheepishly, a few years ago.\nMy bet on DJT falling below $25 could pay off if Trump wins the election and the stock price tanks anyway. That seems unlikely, however, which means I’m basically staking my bet on Kamala Harris winning and Trump losing. So Trump fans can freely troll me if Trump wins and I end up $390 poorer. If I win, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.\nEither way, watch Yahoo Finance for one final, climactic dispatch on how my Trump trade turns out.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Donald Trump made a wide array of promises on the campaign trail in recent months that he will now need to implement after a decisive victory set him up for a return to the Oval Office in 2025.\nSome of them will be easier for him to do by himself than others.\nOn two of his signature promises — a new wave of tariffs on imports from around the world and a \"mass deportation\" of undocumented immigrants — an American president is imbued with considerable authority to act unilaterally.\nAnd Trump has given every indication he intends to try. In a speech early Wednesday morning, Trump said \"America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate\" and promised to move quickly.\nOther priorities will require more partners. The still unsettled picture of who will control the House of Representatives will shape what Trump is able to implement on issues like tax cuts and a rollback of green energy credits.\nThe control of the House is still up for grabs as of Tuesday morning, according to AP projections, with over 50 races still to be called.\nRepublicans also took control of the Senate on Tuesday night, meaning that if they can eke out a win in the House, they would largely have complete control over Washington's levers of power.\nTrump spent much of the campaign promising to enact his tariff ideas \"quickly\" and a series of moves by Congress stretching back decades could allow him to do that.\nIt is Congress that formally — per the US Constitution — has the power to \"lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.\" But lawmakers have ceded much of that power to the Oval Office in a series of bills that stretch back decades.\nThe so-called \"Section 301\" and \"Section 232\" tariff authority that has been exercised in recent years by both Trump and President Joe Biden are based on some of these bills. They have allowed both men to enact tariffs via a process that can be timely — requiring a review process by the Commerce Department — but with little outside input.\nRead more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them?\nTrump allies have also talked in recent months about testing presidential power further on other untested options, such as a long-forgotten 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers.\nThat could be dusted off and would perhaps allow a president to act even more quickly and impose higher duties than his other authorities.\nThe question many experts ask is whether courts — not Congress — will intervene. \"He would almost certainly be sued by somebody,\" William Reinsch, a longtime trade policymaker, noted in an interview earlier this year. Whether a judge would agree and intervene remains to be seen.\nThe president also has considerable unilateral authority on immigration.\nThe president-elect has promised what he calls \"mass deportations\" of perhaps millions of undocumented immigrants and is expected to call on agencies of government he will soon control, from the US military to diplomats, to turn that promise into a reality.\nIn addition to the humanitarian crisis such a move could provoke, it could also have an economic cost.\nA note from Capital Economics late Tuesday night outlined some of the worries. The authors said they expected Trump to push forward on his proposed immigration curbs and tariffs. They said that, as a result, \"we are minded to reduce our GDP growth forecast ... by roughly 1% and add 1% to our inflation forecast over the same period.\"\nOf course, presidential administrations have widespread authority to act in countless other areas that will be felt across the economy, from approving mergers to adding or subtracting regulations.\nTrump will also be atop an intense tax debate that policymakers will be wrestling with in 2025 over whether to extend tax cuts that Trump himself signed into law in 2017.\nWhat Trump has promised is a complete extension of the cuts for individuals of all income levels, alongside a dizzying array of additional promises from no taxes on tips and overtime to lowering taxes for big business.\nThat's likely to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $9 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nWhether Trump can act will depend on the makeup of Congress — in other words, who is across the negotiating table from him.\nIf Democrats end up with control of the US House of Representatives next year, they will likely be able to pare that tax agenda down significantly and also make it into a longer process of bipartisan back and forth.\nBut if Republicans win control of both the House, in addition to their newfound control of the White House and the Senate — the so-called trifecta — then the GOP will largely be able to only negotiate among themselves.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has openly talked in recent months about how Republicans hope to use Congress's reconciliation process to act quickly, perhaps within Trump's first 100 days, to move on a tax bill if they have complete control and the power to do so.\nAnother key area where Trump will need Congress has to do with some of his promises to repeal green energy credits that Biden signed into law.\nIn a recent Wall Street Journal interview, billionaire financier John Paulson — a possible Trump Treasury secretary — said that his particular focus if he is installed would be on gutting the Inflation Reduction Act and eliminating green energy subsidies.\nWhile such a move could save the US government about $921 billion over the coming decade, Trump would almost surely need control of Congress to follow through.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nEvery Friday, Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, Rick Newman, and Ben Werschkul bring you a unique look at how US policy and government affect your bottom line on Capitol Gains.

        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump is about to face a major decision that could shake up the financial world and his fortune. By the end of September, Trump will be free to sell his entire stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns his social media platform, Truth Social. But what happens if he decides to cash out?\nDon't Miss:\nDon’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nTrump currently owns more than 114 million shares in Trump Media, a stake valued at about $2.5 billion. That's a big chunk of his estimated $4.3 billion net worth. Until now, he hasn't been able to sell these shares because of a lockup agreement – a rule that prevents company insiders from selling their stock right after the company goes public. But that restriction is set to end in late September.\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nIf Trump decides to sell, it could have major consequences. For one, the stock price might plummet. Financial experts are already worried that if Trump dumps his shares, there might not be enough buyers willing to snap them up, which could cause the stock to drop even more.\nAs Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, pointed out, the overall stock market has been doing well, but Trump Media’s stock has been trending downward. It closed at $21.42 recently, its lowest since going public. \"The rising tide hasn't lifted that boat,\" he said.\nTrending: With over 15k units already sold, this female-owned dog waste startup is targeting the $147 billion pet industry – here’s how to invest early at just $1 per share.\nWhy is this happening? Trump Media's fortunes are closely tied to Trump's reputation and popularity. As the 2024 election heats up, Trump's standing in the polls has taken a hit after Kamala Harris took the lead as the Democratic nominee.\nMatthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, didn't mince words, telling Politico that Trump has “stepped on just about every rake he possibly could” since his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. This has been “hammering the stock.”\nTrending: Groundbreaking trading app with a ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market – here’s how to get equity in it with just $100\nAccording to its latest earnings report, the company is having a tough time financially, losing over $16 million in just three months. It’s clear to almost everyone that Trump Media’s future depends on the 2024 election. If Trump wins the election, that alone could boost the company's stock and do a complete 180.\nInvestors are worried that Trump might sell his shares to cover his growing legal bills or fund his campaign. But selling such a large stake could flood the market with too many shares, pushing the price down further. And with Truth Social not generating much revenue compared to bigger platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, Trump Media's sky-high valuation doesn't match its actual financial performance.\nTrending: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\nTrump hasn't said what he plans to do once he's free to sell his shares, and his team isn't giving any hints. Meanwhile, Trump Media is trying to expand its business, recently adding in-app streaming to Truth Social. The company says it has $344 million in cash and no debt, which gives it some breathing room.\nFor now, all eyes are on Trump as he prepares to make a decision that could affect not just his fortune but also the future of his media empire and the investors who have big bets on him.\nRead Next:\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Trump Soon Free To Sell All His Stake In Trump Media.

        "date": "2024-10-23T20:01:19.000Z",
        "article_content": "McDonald’s has been thrust into the 2024 election, gaining particular attention over the weekend when former President Donald Trump served fries at a Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, location. But McDonald’s had nothing to do with Trump’s visit.\nThe company operates on a franchise model, which means the vast majority of its locations are independently owned and operated. Although franchise owners have to abide by certain guidelines in their agreements with the parent company, they are free to invite political candidates to serve fries without McDonald’s buy-in.\nThe company said Sunday in an internal memo to employees obtained by CNN that it did not invite Trump or the attention the election has brought it — but the company spun the spotlight as proof that McDonald’s remains a key part of everyday American life for millions of people.\n“As we’ve seen, our brand has been a fixture of conversation this election cycle. While we’ve not sought this, it’s a testament to how much McDonald’s resonates with so many Americans,” the company said in its memo. “McDonald’s does not endorse candidates for elected office and that remains true in this race for the next President. We are not red or blue – we are golden.”\nThe letter was signed by its entire US senior leadership team, including McDonald’s President Joe Erlinger.\nAt the staged event, Trump put on an apron to work as a fry attendant and handed people food at the location, which had been closed for the campaign stop.\nMcDonald’s said that it was proud that Trump has often expressed his love for McDonald’s and Harris spoke fondly of her time working at the company, to which she has frequently referred during her campaign and a refrain that Trump, without evidence, has disputed. Harris says she briefly worked at the chain during the summer of 1983 when she was still a student at Howard University in Washington.\nStill, some McDonald’s customers and employees spoke out against the company after Trump’s visit, criticizing McDonald’s for allowing the Republican presidential candidate to campaign at a restaurant.\nThe company clarified in its memo that Derek Giacomantonio, the franchise’s owner and operator, was approached by local law enforcement about Trump’s desire to visit and Giacomantonio accepted.\n“He was proud to highlight how he and his team serve their local community and make delicious food, like our World-Famous French Fries,” the company said. “Upon learning of the former President’s request, we approached it through the lens of one of our core values: we open our doors to everyone.”\nFranchises are a key part of McDonald’s business, with roughly 95% of all McDonald’s locations operated by franchise operators. Operators pay a royalty rate to use McDonald’s brand and for access to its expertise. They also help pay for other expenses, like restaurant renovations.\nThe company has run into trouble with franchises in the past, most notably after a McDonald’s operator in Israel offered discounts to soldiers and security forces after Hamas’ October 7 attack. After news of the promotion was disseminated on social media, many customers began boycotting McDonald’s in Muslim-dominated countries — so much so that McDonald’s has cited Middle East boycotts on its earnings as a drag on its business over the past several quarters.\nMcDonald’s said the chain has “election toolkits” to handle events like this.\nCNN’s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

        "date": "2024-05-14T17:44:56.000Z",
        "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump drew scorn when, in 2018, he declared, \"I am a tariff man.\" But Trump may just have been ahead of his time.\nPresident Biden on Tuesday took a page from Trump’s playbook, announcing the steepest set of tariffs on Chinese products since Trump waged his trade war in 2018 and 2019. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Biden said these actions were \"about saving American jobs.\"\nThere are differences between the two packages, but each 2024 presidential candidate is using China as a bogeyman to win key votes in a handful of swing states.\nBiden will raise or impose new tariffs on steel, aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, EV batteries and components, solar cells, cranes, and medical products imported to the United States from China.\nThat might sound like a long list, but it’s actually very targeted. Biden is basically raising the cost of certain imported products in key industries where he’s trying to build out domestic supply chains.\nTrump, in a slight contrast, was busy imposing tariffs on roughly half of all Chinese imports to the United States, an outdated-sounding idea rooted in an earlier century before the world globalized.\nSome of Biden's new tariffs are modest, while others are steep.\nThe tariff on EV batteries, for instance, will go from 7.5% to 25%, which might keep them cheap enough to stay on some US manufacturers' order lists. But the tariff on Chinese-made EVs will quadruple from 25% to 100%, which is basically an effort to price them out of the US market completely.\nThe tariffs do fit with Biden’s focus on reviving domestic manufacturing.\nIn his first two years as president, Biden signed into law major packages of incentives to stimulate more American production of semiconductors, green energy products, and other types of goods. He’s now pairing punitive measures — tariffs — with those incentives, which were mostly structured as tax breaks.\nBiden, importantly, has also left the Trump tariffs on Chinese imports in place.\nThose were more widespread than what Biden is imposing now, covering thousands of product categories. Trump was less focused on reviving any particular industry and more focused on simply lowering the US trade deficit with China, a fixation that many economists deemed odd and even pointless.\nTrump has also promised even steeper tariffs on Chinese products if he beats Biden in November and wins a second term. His latest plan is an across-the-board tariff as high as 60% on all Chinese imports, with a new 10% tariff on all imports from everywhere else.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\nAll these developments are distressing to free traders because they raise costs and reduce efficiency with no economic payoff. There’s certainly a political payoff, however — or at least the candidates hope there is.\n\"For Biden, the tariff announcement is all about the election, as it supports his industrial policy agenda and further builds his tough-on-China resume,\" Beacon Policy Advisors explained in a May 13 analysis. \"The announcement continues the trend of pursuing trade policies aimed at the Rust Belt.\"\nPennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin are key swing states a presidential candidate basically has to win these days to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes.\nBiden has been aggressively courting blue-collar workers in those states, joining a picket line with striking auto workers last year, as one example. He calls himself the most pro-union president in American history and has fashioned policies and legislation to back that up.\nTrump’s approach is more scattershot. He vilifies China as a destroyer of American jobs and paints himself as savior-in-chief, with less focus on aiding specific industries.\nTrump tried using steel and aluminum tariffs to aid those domestic industries, but his policies weren’t as targeted as those of Biden, who, for instance, will impose a new 50% tariff on medical syringes to help boost US production.\nThe irony of all this economic flag-waving, however, is that protectionist policy doesn’t necessarily help the US economy.\nOne 2021 study found that Trump’s tariffs killed 245,000 jobs on net, mainly by driving US production costs higher. More expensive imports probably contributed to the inflation surge that began in 2021. A 2022 study found that cutting the average import tariff by just 2 percentage points would have cut the inflation rate by 1.3 points.\nBiden obviously chose not to make such a move, which indicates how important it has become for a president to convince voters he’s tough on China.\nInstead, he’s imposing more tariffs that future studies will probably show did more harm than good. Economically, that is. Politically, it seems both Trump and Biden think imposing tariffs on China is a winning strategy.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "Tariff Man is getting in over his head.\nTariffs were a prominent feature of Donald Trump’s first presidential term — and he’s running for a second term by promising a lot more where that came from. Trump says he’ll slap tariffs of 10% to 20% on most imports, with a 60% levy on imports from China. On some days, Trump slings even bigger numbers.\nTrump says a lot of things that seem more like provocations than serious policy ideas. He likes to rattle establishmentarians with radical ideas. But Trump’s tariff plans are now boomeranging back on him and causing Trump himself to lose his footing.\nWhen Trump does serious interviews, questioners always ask why the former president wants to hit ordinary Americans with a tax that could cost the typical household more than $2,000 per year, trigger retaliatory actions that harm American exporters, and generally roil the US economy.\nTrump has a practiced answer — people in other countries pay the tariffs, so it’s not a problem — but that’s completely false and almost always unsatisfying to his interviewers.\nDuring an Oct. 15 appearance before the Economic Club of Chicago, John Micklethwait of Bloomberg asked Trump if he was really willing to plunge the United States into the biggest trade war since the 1930s. Trump countered that his trade war would have a “massive positive effect” on the US economy. Micklethwait pressed on, pointing out Americans buy $3 trillion worth of imported goods each year and that new tariffs would immediately make all of those goods more expensive.\nTrump explained that American factories would pop up to build all the imported products that are suddenly more expensive.\n“That will take many, many years,” Micklethwait said.\n“No, it’ll happen quickly,” Trump insisted. Then he argued that the higher the tariff, the faster US production will take root.\nTrump digressed into ruminations on World War III, his friendships with foreign leaders, and multiple other things. Micklethwait steered Trump back toward Wall Street concerns that his tariffs would stoke inflation and pointed out that the pro-capitalist Wall Street Journal had bashed the idea.\nThen it got personal. “What does the Wall Street Journal know?” Trump asked. “They’ve been wrong about everything. So have you, by the way. You’ve been wrong all your life on this stuff.”\nTrump supposedly loves this sort of smackdown, where he can insult some elitist bothering him with boring policy questions. But when Trump gets pugilistic, it’s often a diversionary tactic. And in this case, Trump simply doesn’t have any happy talk to explain what will happen between the time he raises tariffs on thousands of imports and all those American factories sprout up in response.\nEconomists know exactly what will happen:\nPrices will go up, Americans will pay more, inflation will go higher, interest rates will go up, and economic growth will slow. It takes years from the time companies and their investors choose to break ground on an American factory for assembly lines to start cranking out products. US production costs are often so high that even with tariff protections, building stuff in America can be cost-prohibitive. Trump could ratchet tariffs higher and higher on some goods and still there would be no American production.\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\nThis is why Goldman Sachs, Moody’s Analytics, Oxford Economics, and many other forecasters predict Trump’s economic plan would be a net drag on the US economy. Business leaders often prefer the low-tax, deregulatory bent of Republicans, but aside from the mercurial Elon Musk, hardly any big company CEOs back Trump's economic plan.\nYahoo Finance recently ran an online survey and found Trump voters were broadly misinformed about tariffs. Of those who identified as Trump voters, 44% acknowledged that tariffs would raise prices, but felt other economic benefits would be worth it. Another 47% felt Trump’s tariffs would not raise prices at all. Among Harris voters, 97% agreed with economists who say tariffs would harm American consumers’ purchasing power.\nTrump wants his backers to think he relishes such fights, yet he is increasingly shying away from them. On the same day as his standoff with Micklethwait, Trump canceled an interview with CNBC, which doubtless would have put Trump on the spot once again about his tariffs. Prior to that, he canceled an appearance on CBS’s 60 Minutes because he objected to being fact-checked.\nTrump is opting for friendlier “town hall” venues, where supportive interviewers ask softball questions. That might comfort Trump, but candidates in the late innings of tight races normally court all the free media they can get. Trump’s Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, is doing that, with a Fox News interview scheduled for Oct. 16.\nTrump’s tariffs, meanwhile, seem to know no bounds. On Oct. 13, Fox News’s Maria Bartiromo — a Trump ally and occasional mouthpiece — asked about his threat to impose a 200% tariff on any Chinese-branded car made in Mexico. “That’s only going to mean higher prices for consumers,” Bartiromo said. “It’s got to be passed on somehow.”\nTrump seemed unconcerned. “Put 200 or 500,” Trump said. “I’ll put a number where they cannot sell one car.”\nAt some point, a tariff so high that nobody can sell a car means nobody can buy a car, either. But let’s not talk about that.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nDonald Trump's return to the White House has me wondering about the world's most beloved stock, Nvidia (NVDA).\nIs a Trump presidency going to be good or bad for the AI market darling? Has he ever taken CEO Jensen Huang to task on X? Does Jensen feel a certain way about Trump, and perhaps could add headline risk to the company's stock price?\nAll of this matters since, as I mentioned, Nvidia has become the market — even before its inclusion in the former smokestack index known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).\nThe short answer to all of these pressing questions is, who really knows? I can't find a lot.\nDo an advanced search of Trump's X account, and you do not unearth a single post on Jensen or Nvidia. Scour interviews of Jensen from the prior Trump presidency, and there isn't much for Trump to feast on as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\"I’m optimistic about the outcome, irrespective of how, on balance, I prefer a more liberal government. I have confidence in the resilience of the institutions. We’ll find a way through and find a way forward,\" Huang said in a November 2016 VentureBeat story following Trump's first White House win.\nHuang is besties with Tesla (TSLA) CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk, but it's unclear what that means for Nvidia's financial fortunes over the next four years.\nChat up investors, and the early vibe is that Nvidia should do just fine, as the factors driving its business are simply too powerful to be snuffed out.\n\"It's hard to draw a straight line between AI or Nvidia and Trump,\" EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). \"I think there's some interesting ways that AI is kind of infiltrating all corners of tech. But in general, obviously, Trump is very pro-growth, low taxes, and that's going to sweep up all of tech and that includes AI.\"\nJackson thinks Nvidia could see stronger demand from the bitcoin mining industry, as Trump may open up the digital asset markets more.\nNvidia could also cash in from looser regulations on the energy industry, freeing up hyperscalers to move more quickly with AI infrastructure buildouts, Jackson reasoned.\nOne risk to watch, Jackson said, is if a tariff-induced trade war with China occurs. Nvidia not only sells chips in China but has important product development talent in the country. You also have to keep in mind what this trade war would mean to China's relationship with key chip producer Taiwan.\nBut by and large, Nvidia is poised to continue being Nvidia, experts say.\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya told me the company's next three chips after Blackwell — Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra — could be huge performers. Those offerings will begin hitting the market in Q3 2025 based on Arya's analysis.\nYahoo Finance data shows analysts estimating Nvidia's earnings growth to hit 43% at $4.08 a share in 2025. Looks conservative to me based on all the conversations I've been having. I could easily make the case Nvidia does $5 a share in earnings next year. Assuming a P/E multiple of 40 times as opposed to the rather low 37 times currently, Nvidia is a $200 stock compared to $148 today.\nJackson thinks the stock is worth a minimum of $250.\nIt's hard to see how a Trump presidency unravels this potential future earnings power in 2025 — if anything it may ignite it.\n\"Trump is a clear bullish foundation for Big Tech. We believe Musk will help navigate the China issues so they don’t negatively impact the yin and yang for US tech and the AI Revolution. And with Lina Khan [likely] out at the FTC, Nvidia will be more aggressive on tech M&A,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.\nHaving laid this out, what can go wrong?\nThree times each week, I drive insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "article_content": "Economic shifts are on the horizon, affecting taxes, healthcare and housing as the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump approaches.\nLearn More: 3 Things Retirees Should Sell To Build Their Retirement Savings\nFind Out: How To Financially Plan for the New Year Under the New Trump Presidency\nBaby boomers face specific challenges and opportunities to boost their financial security while planning for long-term health needs.\nWhether you’re looking to maximize your savings, refinance your house or plan for caregiving responsibilities, the Trump economy begins. Here are four money moves boomers should make before Inauguration Day.\nThe major economic policy changes of the incoming Trump administration are likely to include a combination of regulatory rollbacks, tighter immigration controls, and import tariffs, said Stuart Schiffman, founder and managing partner of Compound Wealth Advisors.\n“While we don’t know the magnitude of these policy changes, it would be prudent for boomers who anticipate retiring in the next few years to have ample cash on hand to pay for living expenses,” Schiffman said. “The extra cash cushion may be needed to avoid selling stocks during a market dip. Losses in the early years of retirement can never be recouped if the principal is spent.”\nRead Next: Avoid This Retirement Savings Mistake That’s Costing Americans Up To $300K\nShifts in healthcare policy also call for prioritizing budgeting and savings.\nChristopher Stroup, founder and president of Silicon Beach Planning, said boomers should periodically review the government programs available because eligibility and benefits for Medicaid or other support systems may change.\nFor example, President-elect Donald Trump appointed Dr. Mehmet Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\nOverseeing federal healthcare programs that serve 160 million Americans, CMS is one of the most powerful government agencies. Oz is a board-certified heart surgeon and a former television talk show host who has come under fire for his skepticism of his stance on COVID-19 vaccines.\nWhile Dr. Oz unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate from Pennsylvania in 2022, he doesn’t have experience running a federal bureaucracy. Nevertheless, Dr. Oz has advocated for government health insurance for those who can’t afford it and suggested implementing a 20% payroll tax to privatize Medicare fully.\n“Boomers should consider setting up a dedicated savings fund specially for healthcare and long-term care expenses,” Stroup said. “An effective way to do this is through a Health Savings Account (HSA) if eligible, or a separate investment account that is earmarked for future healthcare needs Having personal savings can ensure they aren’t caught off guard.”\nOne option for boomers is to save for policy changes that could affect their wallet and retirement savings is to allocate a portion of their assets to fixed indexed annuities, which provide both protection of principal and guaranteed income for life.\n“Many retirees value those benefits, and there could be other positives beyond those provided by annuities,” said Tom Buckingham, Chief Growth Officer at Nassau Financial Group.\n“By allocating a portion of their assets to annuities that provide a stable source of income, boomers could allocate other assets to equities, real estate or other risk assets that might benefit from an inflationary environment.”\nNow might be a favorable time to refinance your house, especially for boomers who have a mortgage with a higher interest rate.\n“Even though interest rates have been rising in recent years, they’re still relatively low compared to historical norms,” Stroup said. “So, refinancing could help secure a lower rate and reduce monthly payments.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nBarbara Corcoran: If Mortgage Rates Hit This Number, the Market Will \"Go Ballistic\"\n13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You\nThese 11 Rare Coins Sold for Over $1 Million\nI'm a Retirement Planner: 7 Ways I Am Guiding Clients Now That Trump Won\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: The Trump Economy Begins: 4 Money Moves Boomers Should Make Before Inauguration Day"

        "date": "2024-12-28T08:44:00.000Z",
        "article_content": "In November, close to 52 million retired-worker beneficiaries took home an average Social Security check of $1,925.46. While this isn't a boatload of money, it's proved to be a vital source of income for our nation's aging workforce.\nIn each of the last 23 years, national pollster Gallup has completed a survey that questions how reliant retirees are on the money they receive from America's leading social program. Since 2002, 80% to 90% of respondents -- including 88% in April 2024 -- have noted that Social Security is a \"major\" or \"minor\" income source. Put another way, close to 9 out of 10 seniors could struggle to make ends meet if Social Security didn't exist.\nBut in spite of the undeniably important role Social Security plays in shoring up the financial foundations of tens of millions of retirees, this relied-upon program is faltering.\nCurrent and future beneficiaries are counting on their elected officials to strengthen Social Security -- and this includes incoming President Donald Trump.\nEver since the first retired-worker benefit check was mailed out in January 1940, the Social Security Board of Trustees has released an annual report detailing the financial health of the program. In addition to showing how income is collected and where those dollars end up, the annual Trustees Report projects how financially sound Social Security will be over the long run, which is defined as the 75 years following the release of a report.\nFor four decades (since 1985), every Trustees Report has forecast a long-term funding obligation shortfall. In simpler terms, the Trustees don't believe aggregate income collection in the 75 years following a report will be sufficient to cover outlays, including annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs).\nThe 2024 Trustees Report pegged Social Security's 75-year funding shortfall at $23.2 trillion, which is up $800 billion from the 2023 report.\nWhat's even more worrisome is that sweeping benefit cuts may be right around the corner for retirees. According to the 2024 Trustees Report, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI), which is responsible for dishing out payments to retired workers and survivors of deceased workers each month, is forecast to exhaust its asset reserves by 2033.\nBefore going any further, let's make clear that depleting the OASI's asset reserves doesn't mean Social Security is bankrupt, insolvent, or going to disappear. What it does suggest is that the current payout schedule, including COLAs, isn't sustainable. If the OASI's asset reserves are gone by 2033, as forecast, sweeping benefit cuts of up to 21% may be needed to avoid any further cuts through 2098.\nOngoing demographic shifts -- not \"congressional theft\" or \"undocumented migrants\" -- such as a historically low U.S. birth rate and rising income inequality, are the reasons Social Security's financial foundation is crumbling.\nAlthough President-elect Donald Trump avoided tackling the controversial topic that is Social Security during his first term in the Oval Office, presidential candidates rarely have the luxury of taking no stance on key topics while on the campaign trail.\nIn late July, while posting on his social media platform, Truth Social, the now-president-elect stated eight words that offer a potential promise to change Social Security forever: \"Seniors should not pay tax on Social Security.\"\nAdmittedly, this isn't a bill or even a sketch of a bill. But it does intimate favorability on the part of the incoming president to eliminate the taxation of Social Security benefits.\nIn 1983, Social Security was in a similar situation to what the Trustees anticipate will happen in nine years. With the program's asset reserves expected to be depleted, Congress passed and then-President Ronald Reagan signed the Social Security Amendments of 1983 into law.\nThis bipartisan overhaul of America's leading retirement program gradually increased payroll taxation on workers and the full retirement age over time. It also introduced the taxation of benefits.\nBeginning in 1984, up to 50% of Social Security benefits could be exposed to the federal tax rate if provisional income (adjusted gross income + tax-free interest + one-half benefits) surpassed $25,000 for single filers or $32,000 for couples filing jointly. Roughly a decade later, in 1993, the Clinton administration tacked on a second tax tier that allowed up to 85% of benefits to be exposed to federal taxation in instances where provisional income topped $34,000 for single filers and $44,000 for couples filing jointly.\nWhen the taxation of benefits was initially implemented, it was expected to impact about 10% of all senior households. But since these income thresholds have never been adjusted for inflation, rising COLAs over time have steadily increased the percentage of retirees subject to this tax.\nDonald Trump's implied elimination of the taxation of benefits would likely boost monthly payouts for around half of all Social Security recipients.\nWhile President-elect Donald Trump's casual proposal to do away with the taxation of Social Security benefits fits with his overall theme of reducing taxes, this seemingly well-intentioned action could have dire consequences for America's leading retirement program.\nPutting aside the well-known fact that seniors overwhelmingly dislike having their benefits taxed, this income is an absolute necessity for Social Security.\nSocial Security generates income three ways:\nThe 12.4% payroll tax on earned income, which includes wages and salary but not investment income\nThe interest income earned on its asset reserves, which are invested in special-issue, interest-bearing government bonds, as required by law\nThe taxation of Social Security benefits\nWith Social Security spending more than it's bringing in each year, the program's ability to generate interest income may soon be gone. Eliminating the taxation of benefits would remove another source of income, which by the Trustees' estimate is expected to generate almost $944 billion in cumulative income from 2024 through 2033 for the combined OASI and Disability Insurance Trust Fund.\nIn other words, if Trump were to change Social Security forever by no longer taxing benefits, there's a very high probability that it would expedite the depletion of the OASI's asset reserves and increase the magnitude of benefit cuts needed to sustain payouts, including COLAs, over the coming 75 years.\nAdditionally, the incoming president would face the challenging task of getting the 60 votes needed in the Senate to amend the Social Security Act. It's been 45 years since either party held a supermajority of 60 seats in the upper house of Congress. Even if every Republican senator in the incoming Congress voted in favor of removing the taxation of benefits, Trump would still need seven Democrats to join his cause, which seems highly unlikely.\nThough this may not be the last we hear about eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits, there's simply no financial incentive for lawmakers to get rid of this necessary income source.\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year!

The Tesla Inc. and SpaceX boss will now find out whether it pays off, or if he ends up getting burned.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly\nArizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump\nScoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District\nKey Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration\nListen and subscribe to Elon, Inc. on Apple, Spotify, iHeart and the Bloomberg Terminal.\nMusk, whose growing political apparatus has already proved its mettle, will gain more than just an ally in the White House. Trump has vowed to give him an official role cutting government spending — and with it, the power to influence policy and the federal agencies that oversee his vast empire of companies.\n“He’s a character. He’s a special guy. He’s a super genius,” Trump said of Musk while addressing his supporters overnight. “We have to protect our geniuses. We don’t have that many of them.”\nAlready, shares in Tesla are surging. The stock soared as much as 15% in US trading as investors look to cash in on a Trump return to the White House. Musk also posted a chart early Wednesday morning that he said showed record usage of X, his social network.\n“Let that sink in,” he wrote in another missive, posting a parody photo of himself carrying a sink into the Oval Office — a nod to when he hoisted a sink into Twitter headquarters after taking over the social media company.\nIn the last few months, Musk was Trump’s most aggressive surrogate. The world’s richest man propped up Trump on X, hosted town halls in the critical state of Pennsylvania, and appeared at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally with even higher billing than the Republican’s own running mate, JD Vance.\nMusk spent more than $130 million on Trump and down-ballot Republicans in competitive House races, vaulting him to the highest echelons of donors this election cycle. On Election Day, Musk voted in Texas and then flew on his private jet to Florida to watch returns with Trump and his family at Mar-a-Lago. His PAC posted a photo of him sitting shoulder to shoulder with Trump and Dana White, the chief executive officer of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n“Musk is new to politics, but it means a lot for a billionaire and a tech mogul to go all in for President Trump,” said Jondavid Longo, the Pennsylvania state director of Early Vote Action, an organization dedicated to registering Republican voters. Trump’s win in Pennsylvania was key to his victory, helping him flip battleground states he’d lost in 2020 but won in his first run for president, in 2016. Musk donated $1 million to the group.\nSome voters were turned off by Musk’s aggressive financial involvement in the election.\n“I believe the election laws need to change so billionaires like Elon can’t buy the election,” said Suzie Bradrick, a registered Republican in Pennsylvania who voted for Harris on Tuesday. She was particularly upset that a Pennsylvania judge had voided a legal challenge to Musk’s $1 million giveaway.\n“I’ve never seen another billionaire campaign like that,” she said. “But it worked.”\nMusk has much to gain financially from the incoming administration. He oversees an empire of six companies, several of which are highly entangled with the US federal government. SpaceX has become an increasingly vital partner to NASA and the US Defense Department, with contracts worth billions. Tesla has staked its financial future on developing autonomous robotaxis, a risky pursuit facing serious regulatory hurdles.\nMusk’s personal fortune swung wildly during Biden’s four years in office, reaching as high as $340 billion and as low as $124 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Still, it has largely trended upward. As of Election Day, his net worth was $263.8 billion.\nDuring the campaign, Musk pitched a job for himself to cut government bureaucracy and waste. Trump heartily embraced the idea and regularly mentioned it on the campaign trail.\n“I’m going to get Elon. And he’s great at this. He’s going to be our cost cutter,” said Trump at a campaign rally in Michigan in late September. Trump has referred to position the “Secretary of Cost Cutting,” while Musk has joked that he’ll lead a Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in a nod to the cryptocurrency he’s long promoted.\nMusk has claimed he could cut an unprecedented $2 trillion from the federal budget. He hasn’t specified the agencies he’d go after, but regularly rails against the regulators that oversee his companies. During a long diatribe on the Joe Rogan podcast this week, he described a SpaceX rocket that sat on a launchpad for two months waiting for approval.\n“We could build the rocket faster than they could approve the paperwork,” he said. “It’s like Gulliver being tied down by a million little strings. It’s not like any one string is the problem but you’ve got a million of them.”\nA broad remit would give the Tesla, SpaceX and X boss leverage to reshape federal agencies that both regulate and have the power to investigate his many companies. He’s already said he will try to use whatever power he gets to push for a federal approval process of fully autonomous vehicles. Current rules prevent manufacturers from putting more than a couple thousand cars on the road per year without steering wheels or other controls.\nIt’s not uncommon for US presidents to tap executives and business leaders to fill their administrations. During his first term, Trump appointed Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who had been his campaign’s finance chair, to be Treasury Secretary. Musk’s potential role cutting government spending isn’t expected to be a Cabinet-level position, meaning he wouldn’t be required to step away from his CEO duties.\nAlready Musk’s support has influenced the president-elect. After the billionaire’s endorsement in July, Trump changed his tune on electric vehicles, going from entirely railing against what he called “crooked Joe’s insane electric vehicle mandate” to praising EVs at times.\n“I’m for electric cars. I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly, Elon. So I have no choice,” Trump said during an August rally.\nTrump also embraced Musk’s ambitions of reaching Mars using SpaceX rockets by 2028, or by the end of the Republican’s term. “We will land an American astronaut on Mars. Thank you, Elon. Thank you. Get going, Elon,” Trump said at an October rally.\nMusk’s policy interests go beyond those that benefit his companies. Like Trump, he’s pushed conspiracy theories and misinformation about immigrants to his more than 200 million followers on X.\nBut it’s one thing to campaign together; it’s another to work together. The president-elect is known for turning on even his most loyal friends and colleagues. Musk and Trump may be aligned for now, but points of tension could arise between two men known for their egos.\nOn EVs, for example, Tesla has received billions from President Biden’s policies, which Trump has vowed to dismantle. The two own rival social media companies, and not too long ago, Musk was calling for Trump to “hang up his hat and sail into the sunset.”\nWhatever happens between the two, Musk will leave this election cycle with a robust political machine that he can use to not only bolster his businesses, but also his pet policies.\n“America PAC is going to keep going after this election,” Musk said on an X Spaces Tuesday. Musk said the group is “preparing for the midterms and any intermediate elections at the district attorney and sort of judicial levels.”\nMusk’s America PAC, which spent $153 million on behalf of Trump, now has contact information from scores of voters, which it can use going forward.\nDemocrats painted Musk as their billionaire foil, echoing a Harris campaign warning that Trump’s “buddy Elon Musk is spending huge sums of money on his own ads hammering the Vice President.” They beseeched voters not to let the richest person on the planet buy the election.\nThose pleadings were to no avail.\n--With assistance from Brian Chappatta.\n(Updates with new voter quote starting in paragraph 9)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Winning Bet on Crypto Could Transform Brain and Longevity Science\n‘I’m Suffering’: What the 2024 Election Taught Me About America\nThe Crypto World’s Victory Lap Begins\nWhat Trump Can Do to Workers’ Biden-Era Gains\nWhy the Washington Commanders Are the Most Exciting Team in the NFL\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

        "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump has recently appointed Elon Musk to colead a new Department of Government Efficiency. The goal? To cut down on government waste and make things run smoother, all while saving money. Musk will work alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, which, as many have pointed out, is unusual for a cost-cutting department.\nBut what makes Musk qualified for this role? Well, he’s no stranger to maximizing efficiency in his companies, although this has put him in hot water with the unions.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before it closes in a few days.\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nWhen Musk bought Twitter in 2022, one of his first and most infamous moves was to rebrand it as X and cut down on what he saw as unnecessary perks. Out went the free office lunches and remote work became a thing of the past. As Business Insider reported, Musk demanded an intense commitment from those who stayed, telling employees that tough times were ahead. They needed to work with \"a maniacal sense of urgency.\" He also famously slashed about half of Twitter’s staff, signaling that only the most dedicated would remain.\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nMusk's management style at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has always been about pushing the limits for himself and his team. Tesla's employee handbook encourages workers to break traditional office rules to solve problems. Employees who think something can be done better are expected to act on it, even if it means reaching out to Musk directly.\nIn a late-night companywide email announcing the layoffs, Musk also demanded the resignation of any Tesla executive with more than three direct reports who \"don't obviously pass the excellent, necessary and trustworthy test.\"\nMusk has led by example, having spent nights sleeping on the factory floor to show his dedication. This intense work culture, where nothing is more important than getting things done, has helped Tesla keep costs under control while expanding massively.\nSee Also: This rooftop wind turbine is taking on a market projected to reach over $900 billion by 2032 — With already over 40,000 users signing up to purchase, here's a chance to be an early investor today!\nSpaceX, Musk's aerospace company, also follows a \"ruthlessly efficient\" approach. In 2019, Musk cut 10% of the workforce to ensure the company remained lean enough to achieve its goals. At SpaceX and his other companies, Musk has insisted that workers leave meetings that don't benefit them. Additionally, SpaceX remains steadfast in its goal of lowering the cost of space travel. Still, the company raised its rocket launch prices by around 8% in 2022.\nApplying it to Government\n\nSo, how might Musk's approach translate to government work? Trump believes Musk's private sector successes could bring a much-needed shake-up to Washington. Just like his companies, it's likely Musk will push for fewer employees, a laser focus on priorities and a drive to eliminate anything that doesn't add value.\nRead Next:\n‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nWith over 7.8K investors including Meta, Google, And Amazon Execs — this AI Startup's valuation has skyrocketed from $5 million to $85 million in just three years.

Trump Revocable Trust without monetary compensation, the filing shows.\nDon’t Miss:\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partnered with Amazon, Walmart & Target announces the deadline to invest this year is 12/20. – Last Chance to get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\nThe move comes just days after Trump rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, where DJT stock has surged over 100% year-to-date.

I TOLD YOU SO!!! KAMALA DOESN’T HAVE A CLUE. BIDEN IS SOUND ASLEEP. ALL CAUSED BY INEPT U.S. LEADERSHIP!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform late Sunday night.\nU.S. stock markets plunged Friday following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that raised fears the economy could be slowing down faster than analysts had predicted. By Monday, the sell-off was intensifying, with stock futures for the S&P 500 down more than 2 percent and down more than 4 percent for Nasdaq.\nMarkets around the world declined, especially across Asia and Europe. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index fell 12.4 percent, and the Topix index fell 12.2 percent.\nStock markets have generally been climbing since the beginning of 2023 on a foundation of strong economic data, as employment levels have continually surpassed expectations in the face of the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes meant to slow the economy.\nTrump, who tied himself to the stock market during his presidency, has frequently tried to claim responsibility for stock market records set under President Biden.\nEarlier this year, he said the market was doing well “because they think I’m going to be elected.” He also said investor sentiment was soaring because his polls against Biden were “so good.”\nThe Biden campaign mocked those comments in response, saying Trump was “desperately trying to take credit for the stock market hitting record highs under President Biden.”\nThroughout the morning on Monday, Trump tried to tie the market downturn to Vice President Harris, calling it the “KAMALA CRASH.” He also warned of “THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF 2024!” and of “THE PROBABILITY OF WORLD WAR III.”\n“TRUMP CASH vs. KAMALA CRASH!” he said in one post.\nRepublican lawmakers told The Hill that Trump was caught off guard by the surge in momentum behind Harris’s revamped campaign. Some Republican senators think Trump should have seen the swap atop the Democrat ticket coming and crafted a messaging and political strategy weeks ago.\nThe Hill has reached out to Harris’s campaign for a response to Trump’s recent comments.\nUpdated: 2:15 p.m.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "date": "2024-08-20T20:13:34.000Z",
        "article_content": "Hiding in plain sight in the first annual report issued by the parent company of Donald Trump's Truth Social platform was a statement of inescapable, well, truth.\nIssued, perhaps appropriately, on April 1 by Trump Media and Technology Group, the report said: \"The value of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Trump were to suffer.\" This was cited as a \"risk factor\" in holding the company's stock.\nSo here we are. Since July 21, when President Joe Biden ended his campaign for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to run against Trump, the stock has been spiraling toward oblivion.\nTrump Media and Technology Group acknowledges the limits of Donald Trump's duty to use his own social media platform\nFrom then through Tuesday, shares of the company bearing Trump's initials (DJT) as its ticker symbol have lost nearly 39% of its value. (The broad stock market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index has gained almost 2% over the same time span.)\nThe shares have gained in daily value only five times during that period, and lost ground on 17. The shares closed Tuesday at $21.42, down 82 cents or 3.71%, following a slide of 3.56% the day before.\nIn the context of the grand sweep of DJT's history as a publicly traded company, that's not so remarkable. Measured from its closing price of $57.99 on March 26, when it went public, the stock is down about 63%. Measured from its peak of $79.38, which it reached that day before pulling back, the loss is 73%. Choose which of these calculations you wish; either one fits the dictionary definition of \"ugly.\"\nIt's certainly possible that DJT will have recovered some or all of its daily decline by the end of Tuesday's trading, and even possible that it will emerge from the longer-term schneid in which it currently seems imprisoned. The stock's volatility has made GameStop look like a sober, stable financial asset.\nThat said, however, the headwinds are building — not that they were ever any secret.\nThe principal headwind, of course, is the one telegraphed in that annual report: Trump himself. Since Biden's withdrawal upended the presidential race and brought Kamala Harris to the fore, Trump's prospects for victory in the November election have distinctly faded.\nRead more: Column: With his Truth Social stock, Trump may be laughing all the way to the bank — but his investors have reason to weep\nIn parallel, Trump's rhetoric and behavior on the stump have become more unhinged and febrile. His standing among the MAGA faithful may have remained solid, but his appeal to independent voters appears to have shrunk — it certainly hasn't been enhanced. Since DJT is seen as a proxy for his electoral campaign, its slide in value is unsurprising.\nBut other counterweights have become more significant. One is the question of what Trump intends to do with his own shares in the company, which came to 59.9% of the total shares as of mid-July, according to its financial disclosures. Trump will be entitled to sell any or all of those shares starting in mid-September, when a six-month lockup period expires.\nAny indication that Trump is moving to liquidate his exposure to DJT would almost certainly crater the shares' price; anticipation that he is plotting to leave his outside investors in the lurch, as he has done to investors, partners and customers in other ventures, may account for some of the shares' weakness.\nTrump owns so much of the company that he might be able to realize $1 billion or more via stock sales before other shareholders have a chance to get out the door without taking a loss.\nTrump already has shown that he doesn't take his responsibility to support Truth Social very seriously. He established the platform as a branded alternative to Twitter (now X) after he was thrown off Twitter following the Jan. 6 insurrection. But there is no contractual requirement binding Trump to use Truth Social as his exclusive social media outlet.\nOne provision of his licensing agreement with DJT requires that he post his personal social media communications on Truth Social six hours before posting them on other platforms.\nBut his deal with the company allows him to post \"politically-related\" messages on any platform he chooses — and he has the sole right to determine which posts fall into that category. The company says it \"lacks any meaningful remedy\" if it disagrees with his designation of posts as \"politically-related.\"\nElon Musk restored Trump's account on X in November; he posted there rarely until recently, when his activity picked up. And Trump has posted some tweets on that platform. More notably, on Aug. 12, he Joined Musk for a two-hour rambling, glitch-marred \"interview\" on X, not Truth Social.\nThen there's the stature of the company as a going concern. It issues all the disclosures required of a public company in the U.S., but anyone reading them would be well advised to open a window first.\nRead more: Column: Trump's media company is going public, netting him billions. Why would anyone invest in it?\nFinancially speaking, although it still has a market value of $4 billion, the company doesn't resemble any enterprise that could have been imagined by the value-investing pioneers Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. In its most recent quarterly disclosure, issued Aug. 12, it reported a loss of $344 million on revenue of $1.4 million for the first six months of this year.\nNo one who has followed Trump's career with any modicum of attention could be shocked by those figures — or indeed by the fact that the stock has done as well as it has despite them.\nTruth Social has been a joke from the inception — a joke on many of the same people still flying \"Trump Won\" flags from their front yards or wearing red MAGA hats in mixed company. As I wrote prior to the IPO, it was taken public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, a process that was often employed to circumvent government rules for disclosures to investors. SPACs have fallen out of favor because so many of those deals went bust; Truth Social boasted the highest profile of any of them, but its fate may not be any different.\nIn that first annual report issued on April Fools Day, the company revealed that it scarcely considered itself a real social media business at all. It said it had no plans to “collect, monitor or report” the traditional metrics used by other social media platforms, such as “average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, ... monthly and daily active users” — in other words, all the statistics that tell a social media company who is using it, if anyone, and what their participation is worth in dollars and cents.\nHaving that information would only “divert” the company’s management, the report said, though it wasn’t clear about how management would fashion a strategy for the future if it doesn’t know where it is at present, including just how many users it has.\nI wrote in 2021, when the SPAC deal to take Truth Social public was first announced, that it was poised to set a high-water mark for dubious investment schemes. In April, a month after the IPO, I wrote that that Trump might end up laughing all the way to the bank, but his investors would be left with nothing but tears.\nWe're well on the way to that glorious moment when I can say, \"I told you so.\" Or maybe we're there already.\nGet the latest from Michael HiltzikCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.Sign me up.\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times."

        "article_content": "Anyone watching the news following the presidential election has heard one word associated with President-elect Donald Trump more than any other: tariffs. Tariffs are taxes levied upon foreign goods imported to America from other countries, and throughout his campaign to retake the White House, and even more so after his win, Trump has promised to impose heavy tariffs on the outside world.\nLearn More: How Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency May Impact Your Wallet\nFind Out: 5 Things Boomers Should Do With Their Money Now That Trump Will Be President\nAs reported by the National Retail Federation (NRF), Trump has declared that he will impose a universal tariff of approximately 10% to 20% on all imports from all foreign countries, except China which will specifically receive an additional 60% to 100% tariff.\nSome American manufacturers could benefit from foreign businesses receiving the tariffs; however, many consumers could be negatively impacted: tariffs upon foreign manufacturers force those companies to raise their prices. That, in turn, forces the American companies who purchase those products to raise their prices to offset the newly increased costs.\nThat leaves the American consumer paying far more than what they’re used to.\nRead Next: I’m a Retirement Planner: 7 Ways I Am Guiding Clients Now That Trump Won\nThat kind of price increase for American shoppers is what happened in 2019, when prices on large home appliances (such as washing machines, dryers and dishwashers) all spiked due to Trump imposing tariffs on foreign manufacturers. In a recent study, the NRF has predicted that a similar price surge will occur in 2025 if Trump’s proposed tariffs go through.\nPer the study, Americans would pay between $13.9 billion to $24 billion more than normal for clothing and $6.4 billion to $10.7 billion more in footwear. The home appliances that notoriously spiked in the last Trump administration would cost consumers $6.4 to $10.9 billion more in price increases.\nThe most shocking item on the list was toys, which would be impacted with a 55.8% price hike, costing shoppers $8.8 billion to $14.2 billion more in costs, all because the tariffs “would be too large for U.S. retailers to absorb,” and costs would be passed down to shoppers.\nOverall, if Trump’s tariffs are implemented as he has described them, the NRF predicts that the spending power of American consumers could decrease every year by $46 billion to $78 billion until the tariffs are discontinued.\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "The Federal Reserve's decision to opt for a bigger half-percentage-point cut opened a new area of disagreement between GOP nominee Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\nWhat Trump said this week is that the cuts are a sign of one thing: a weak economy that he claims was brought on by the Biden/Harris administration.\n\"I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much assuming that they are not just playing politics,\" Trump said at a Manhattan bitcoin bar Wednesday.\n\"One or the other,\" the GOP nominee added \"but it was a big cut.\"\nPowell — who was elevated to Fed chair by then-President Trump but has found himself often at odds with him in recent years — offered an opposite analysis Wednesday afternoon.\n\"Our economy is strong overall,\" Powell told reporters, arguing the move to cut the Fed's benchmark rate by 50 basis points was instead a way to try to ensure \"strength in the labor market can be maintained\" alongside economic growth.\nRead more: The Fed rate cut: What it means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nPowell also tried to dampen concern that the large cut was a sign policymakers were behind the curve or overly concerned that a deeper downturn in the economy could be around the corner.\nPresident Biden also weighed in Wednesday afternoon to say the news represented an important milestone.\n\"Inflation and interest rates are falling while the economy remains strong,\" the president wrote as he sided with Powell on the question of the state of the economy.\nVice President Kamala Harris added in her own statement the move is \"welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices [but] my focus is on the work ahead to keep bringing prices down.\"\nHow this ends up impacting the 2024 campaign or economic growth remains to be seen.\nIt comes after a run-up to the crucial decision saw Powell in a stronger-than-expected position politically, seemingly poised to sidestep more severe political fallout for making a crucial Fed pivot just weeks before a presidential election.\nPowell was dinged from the left for waiting too long.\n“This cut in interest rates is yet another acknowledgement that Powell waited too long to reduce rates,” wrote Sen. Elizabeth Warren after the news, but she added that she was happy that lower rates are now in place.\nWarren, who previously this week advocated a 75 basis point cut, added Wednesday that “more rates cuts are needed.”\nThe commentary from Trump on monetary policy is just the latest in a year where Trump, as he did as president, has chosen to regularly weigh in on the Fed with criticisms of Powell.\nTrump raised eyebrows last month when he offered that the president should \"have a say\" in Fed decisions and that Powell has \"gotten it wrong a lot.\"\nOn Wednesday, Powell responded to Trump's comment by defending the historic independence of the central bank and expressing optimism that it would continue in the years ahead.\nEarlier this year, Trump's critiques of Powell were more directly political. He told Bloomberg in June that cuts are something \"they know they shouldn't be doing.\" That came after a February Fox Business interview, when Trump said of cuts, \"I think [Powell's] going to do something to probably help the Democrats.\"\nMore recently, Trump has tended to focus less on the central bank. Weeks can go by without the GOP nominee mentioning the central bank publicly and the topic didn't even come up at last week's debate with Harris.\nTrump instead tends to discuss his energy plans when asked about interest rates, saying more drilling would help drive interest rates lower.\nTrump's plan if he wins, RNC spokesperson Anna Kelly told Yahoo Finance early this week, is to \"declare a national energy emergency to quickly bring down mortgage and interest rates.\"\nTrump's critique is one he's been telegraphing this week. \"They'll do the rate cut and all the political stuff,\" Trump told a Michigan crowd Tuesday night before the news came in but with a cut widely expected. The underlying reason, he added, \"is because the economy is not good, otherwise you wouldn't be able to do it.\"\nFor his part, Powell again sought to downplay the role of politics, noting Wednesday afternoon that the economic effects of this week's move would be felt \"for the most part with a lag\" — presumably after polls close in November.\nEither way, he added, \"Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people, and if we get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly so this really concentrates the mind.\"\n\"We don't put up any other filters,\" he added of politics.\nThis post has been updated.\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer.\nIn a recent program, Jim Cramer celebrated the market’s rally on Donald Trump’s election victory, saying the market likes Trump.\nCramer said the answer to the question of whether you missed the Trump rally lies in the stock you have in your mind. He said many were expecting a contested election and there was a lot of uncertainty around transition. However, that did not happen and that was in itself a win for the market.\nCramer said the market is still “oversold” as many Trump stocks underwent a massive selloff after Kamala Harris reportedly started to gain ground. However, Cramer said the polls were again proved wrong.\nCramer then talked about the stocks that investors can buy to ride the Trump rally.\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Cramer and picked stocks he believes can go higher under the Trump presidency. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nTalking about stocks that can go higher in the Trump era, Cramer said that the President-elect will like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nInvestors will be keenly watching Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) when the company reports its latest quarterly results later this month.\nNvidia’s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\nOverall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that will go higher in Trump presidency according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
