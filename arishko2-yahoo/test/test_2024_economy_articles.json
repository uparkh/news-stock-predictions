        "article_content": "The US economy is on solid footing right now.\nEconomists at Bank of America expect it to stay that way through next year.\nIn a research note released to reporters on Monday, BofA's economics team led by Claudio Irigoyen projected the US economy will grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than current forecasts for 2% growth, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.\nThis comes despite uncertainties surrounding the economic policies of President-elect Donald Trump, including campaign promises of tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigration, which economists have viewed as inflationary.\nThose proposals could also hinder economic growth and pressure an already bloated federal deficit, further complicating the Federal Reserve's path forward for interest rates.\nHigher rates, coupled with a hawkish tariff policy, would strengthen the US dollar and create spillover effects to global financial conditions, representing \"a major shock, not only for the US economy but the rest of the world,\" according to BofA.\nBut there's one important caveat: The US is best prepared to weather any economic storm that follows Trump's agenda.\n\"We like to say that the US imports a lot of stuff, but it doesn't import recessions,\" Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America, told Yahoo Finance in a separate press briefing on Monday. \"It only exports recessions.\"\nBhave added any shifts in US trade policy \"would pose greater risks to the rest of the world than to the US\" due to the economy's resiliency compared to other developed nations.\nRecent domestic growth trends have been \"remarkable,\" in Bhave's view, and the proof is in the data.\nConsumer confidence is at its highest level in 18 months. US economic output hasn't been this strong since April 2022. Retail sales topped estimates for the month of October, the unemployment rate continues to hover at around 4%, and inflation has moderated despite its bumpy path down to 2%. \n\"The world right now is one in which the US economy has consistently outperformed [for] almost two years,\" Bhave said. \"Europe is struggling, China is struggling, so the US is going into any potential disruption to trade policy on much more solid footing than Europe and China are. I think that fact wouldn't be lost on the incoming administration either.\"\nTariffs, in particular, have been one of the most talked-about promises of Trump's campaign. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.\nShould countries retaliate with their own duties, a resulting \"tit-for-tat\" trade war could keep inflation elevated over the long term.\nBofA does not anticipate that scenario playing out, however, noting its \"baseline scenario is for tariffs on China and elsewhere,\" and that it expects the levies \"to be less\" than what's been promised.\nThe firm is \"moderately optimistic a full blown trade war can be avoided.\"\nOverall, \"tariffs can be very disruptive in terms of capital expenditures [and] obviously exports,\" Bhave said.\nBut given the US imports more goods and services from those countries than it exports, \"just by definition, the tariffs pose a much greater threat to those regions than to the US,\" Bhave added.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-09-16T14:33:09.000Z",
        "article_content": "As part of her broader economic proposals, Vice President Kamala Harris rolled out her “Opportunity Economy” agenda on Aug. 16, which she also touted during the Sept. 10 presidential debate.\n“I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy,” Harris said during the debate. The agenda tackles a wide range of economic issues, such as housing, lowering the cost of drugs and groceries, and tax breaks.\nRead Next: 5 Things You Should Stop Wasting Money on If Kamala Harris Wins in November, According to Experts\nFor You: 9 Things You Must Do To Grow Your Wealth in 2024\nHere is what her “Opportunity Economy” plan could look like.\nAlso see the 10 U.S. metros where Harris’ $25,000 down payment proposal would go the furthest for first-time homebuyers.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nHarris said that Americans earning under $400,000 a year would not pay more in new taxes if she were elected, according to a press release.\nIn terms of specific tax breaks, she said she would plan to expand the Child Tax Credit with up to $3,600 per child. She also proposed a new $6,000 child tax credit for families with children in the first year of life.\nIn addition, she’s offered to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. The expansion would cover individuals and couples in lower-income jobs, cutting their taxes by up to $1,500.\nShe also intends to cut taxes to help Americans who are buying insurance via the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Doing so would help Americans save “an average of $700 on their health insurance premiums, totaling over $6,000 per year in savings,” according to the release.\nCheck Out: Trump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: Here’s What That Would Mean for the Economy and Your Wallet\nIn terms of housing assistance, Harris’ proposal includes up to $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, “with more generous support for first-generation homeowners,” according to her campaign website.\nIn addition, she has proposed lowering rents by “taking on corporate and major landlords,” according to the release.\nFinally, if elected, she also intends to call on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act, which would reduce the ability of large investors to buy “in bulk” rental homes — a practice that lowers supply and hikes up prices.\nAs part of her Opportunity Economy agenda, Harris intends to trigger 25 million new business applications by the end of her first term, should she be elected. To that end, she wants to expand the startup expense tax deduction, according to her campaign website.\nHarris also has plans to “increase the share of federal contract dollars going to small businesses.”\n“As President, she will direct her Administration to crack down on anti-competitive practices that let big corporations jack up prices and undermine the competition that allows all businesses to thrive while keeping prices low for consumers,” according to Harris’ campaign website. To achieve this, Harris has proposed extending the cap on the cost of insulin and prescription drug prices to all Americans.\nIn terms of lowering grocery prices, Harris said she would plan to go “after bad actors to bring down Americans’ grocery costs and keep inflation in check,” per the press release. To that end, she’s proposed implementing a federal ban on price gouging food and imposing penalties on companies that don’t abide by the rules.\nHarris’ agenda also includes providing more access to affordable child care and long-term care.\nAs part of that, Harris plans to expand “high-quality home care services for seniors and people with disabilities” and ensure that “hardworking families can afford high-quality child care,” according to her website.\nIf Harris were to be elected, she plans to continue building on the work she has done with President Biden, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the American Rescue Plan. These programs, according to her campaign website, have “supported more than 60,000 infrastructure projects, spurred more than $900 billion in private sector investments, and doubled investments in construction of new manufacturing facilities.”\nIn addition, Harris said she would support innovation in sectors such as semiconductors, clean energy and artificial intelligence.\nHarris’ website claims that she knows “unions are the backbone of the middle class.” In turn, she plans to sign pro-union legislation, “including the PRO Act to support workers who choose to organize and bargain and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act to make the freedom for public service workers to form unions the law of the land.”\nFinally, she also said she would work to raise the minimum wage, implement paid family and medical leave, and end taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.\nIn terms of education, Harris said that she would lower costs for child care and preschool, as well as continue to work to “end the unreasonable burden of student loan debt and fight to make higher education more affordable, so that college can be a ticket to the middle class,” according to her website.\nMark Friedlich, Esq., CPA, the vice president of government affairs at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, said that this agenda is based on the positions Harris and her campaign took during the debate and also incorporates proposals included in Biden’s budget released earlier this year that Harris has supported.\n“Details of the ‘opportunity economy’ will evolve, and the implementation of many of her proposals will require congressional approval,” he said. Friedlich added that these might encounter some implementation challenges, such as securing bipartisan support for major policy changes and balancing increased government spending with concerns about the national debt.\nIn addition, he noted that this agenda might encounter resistance from large corporations and high-income individuals facing tax increases. Additional challenges, he said, might be coordinating federal, state and local efforts for nationwide implementation, as well as ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across diverse communities and geographic regions.\nEditor’s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "article_content": "Investors are increasingly confident the US economy will achieve a \"soft landing,\" a scenario in which higher interest rates lead to lower inflation without a major hit to economic growth.\nOn the surface, it appears all signs point to that outcome. Inflation has eased. The economy is still expanding. Consumer confidence has risen. Retail sales are healthy. Corporate profits remain strong. And stocks continue to hover at record highs, with the Federal Reserve on tap to cut interest rates as soon as its next meeting on Sept. 18.\nBut one strategist warned on Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast that there are cracks under the surface.\n\"We're skating on ice that's a bit thinner than a lot of people presume,\" said Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners.\nDarda pointed to a rising unemployment rate and elevated earnings expectations, both of which contributed to the stock market routs seen at the start of August and September.\n\"It's not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,\" he said. \"That's sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.\"\n\"But there's been some cracks in the business cycle,\" he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at \"super high\" levels.\nTo that point, the S&P 500 shed 2% on Tuesday, dragged down by the tech sector after Nvidia (NVDA) earnings didn't deliver enough of a beat to satiate investors' appetites. Stocks seesawed in the subsequent days as markets struggled to find their footing following the sell-off.\n\"What's unfolding now actually makes a lot of sense to me,\" Darda said of the pullback. \"We're seeing companies that had been soaring off of repeated beats on either revenues or earnings not do so well in this most recent period.\"\nThe recent drawdowns point to how the current market — one in which investors consistently chase hot stocks and hot areas like artificial intelligence — can be a \"dangerous\" game, according to Darda.\n\"What that tells me is that the expectations have just gone up so much. It's impossible to beat expectations indefinitely. Eventually, they’ll catch up,\" he said. \"We're in a bit of a frenzy here. And if things start to go wrong, whether it's the earnings not living up to expectations or the business cycle faltering, that's when you see stock markets roll over in potentially a material fashion.\"\nBut it hasn't just been earnings. The jobs market is also telling a particular story.\nLast month, the July jobs report spooked markets after unemployment unexpectedly rose to 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The move higher also triggered a closely watched recession indicator known as the Sahm Rule.\nThe rule, which has accurately predicted recessions 100% of the time since the early 1970s, measures the three-month average of the national unemployment rate against the previous 12-month low. It's triggered when unemployment rises 0.5% from that level.\nTraders instantly panicked that the economy was slowing more than anticipated. But then the debate ensued: Why was unemployment suddenly seeing an uptick?\nEconomists and strategists began to lay out the possible scenarios, including a theory that above-trend immigration is driving up labor force participation rates, therefore pressuring unemployment as more workers enter the jobs market. This eased investor fears as stocks rebounded to finish August with wins across all three major indexes.\nBut Darda said the rise in unemployment is still \"a bit concerning.\" And he's not completely sold on recent bullish commentary that higher unemployment doesn't really matter as long as the economy keeps growing.\n\"4.3% is still an incredibly low unemployment rate level that looks quite good in the historical context,\" he explained. \"The problem, if there's a problem, is that we're up to 4.3% from a cyclical trough of 3.4%.\"\n\"Those kinds of movements and the level tell us that the economy, if it's still growing, is growing below trend or below the growth rate of potential,\" he said. \"There's an exceptionally fine line between that and an actual recession.\"\nOn Friday, investors digested another update on the jobs market, with the August nonfarm payroll report showing a slight decrease in the unemployment rate to 4.2%.\nMarkets pared earlier losses in the wake of the release, but history suggests stocks will continue to be volatile in the weeks and months ahead.\n\"I do think we're probably in an environment now where volatility is going to stay elevated,\" Darda surmised. \"The risk of a more material pullback and/or correction is quite high.\"\nUltimately, his view is one of caution: \"With what we saw for the last two years with this market backdrop, from these valuation levels, and based on where I think we are in the business cycle, I think we're going to be in choppy waters for a little bit.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "article_content": "The US economy is no longer shocking Wall Street to the upside.\nEconomic consensus has shifted from forecasters chasing the data higher to scaling back levels of optimism as recent data shows activity cooling across a variety of metrics.\nThis has dampened hopes that economic growth could unexpectedly accelerate for a second straight year. \n\"I am having trouble getting too excited about the economy,\" Renaissance Macro head of economic research Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\"Conditions are fine, but I would hardly describe the situation as consistent with a meaningful acceleration.\"\nThe economics research team at Goldman Sachs, led by Jan Hatzius, has been among the most bullish on the state of the economy over the past year. But the firm moved down its estimate for second quarter GDP to reflect an annualized growth rate of 2.7% from 3.2% on May 24 amid \"weak spending momentum to start the quarter.\"\nSimilarly, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker — which uses data inputs from throughout the quarter to extrapolate how GDP is pacing — has moved down to 1.8% after sitting above 4% at the beginning of May.\nDutta's Monday note followed a new reading of activity in the manufacturing sector from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which showed activity fell further into contraction last month.\nThe ISM's manufacturing PMI registered a reading of 48.7 in May, down from a reading of 49.2 and lower than the 49.5 economists expected, according to Bloomberg data.\nAfter entering expansion territory with a reading above 50 in March for the first time since 2022, the index has declined for the last two months.\n\"The drop in the ISM manufacturing index in May adds to the sense that the economy is losing momentum,\" Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote in a note to clients.\nThe fall in PMIs is the latest economic data point to come in weaker than expected.\nIn early May, the April jobs report showed US job growth came in weaker than expected as the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked higher. A softer-than-projected reading on retail sales in April followed this report. In late May, a decline in the second estimate of first quarter economic growth was largely driven by lower consumption.\nThe stock market has taken any signs of a weakening economy in stride, with all three major indexes hitting record highs in May.\nThe correlation between the Citi Economic Surprise index and the S&P 500 has been inching toward a negative correlation, meaning stock investors have been increasingly embracing bad economic news as good news for stocks.\nMany view the current economic data as opening the door for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts while not signaling an outright downturn in economic activity. Lower rates and slower growth could still be a constructive environment for stocks.\nFollowing the weak April jobs report, for instance, the S&P 500 rallied about 1.3%.\nBank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note on Monday that whether economic growth deteriorates further will be key, as \"bad news can turn into bad news\" for stocks too.\nThe next test for this narrative will come on Friday with the release of the May jobs report.\nThe report is expected to show 185,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 3.9%, according to data from Bloomberg.\nKwon believes a print like this would keep the labor market tracking in the \"Goldilocks\" range — not too hot to fuel fears of sticky inflation and not too cold to heighten worries of a slowdown.\nWith inflation still tracking lower, many Wall Street strategists also see room for stocks to rally if a slowing economy proves to be a head fake.\n\"Stronger growth should also be positive for stocks,\" Kwon said.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "date": "2024-10-08T10:00:02.000Z",
        "article_content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nThe better-than-expected September jobs report put an exclamation point on a trend that's been underway for the better part of two months now.\nUS growth data is once again surprising to the upside.\n\"Forget soft landing, maybe we're having no landing,\" Interactive Brokers chief market strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. \"That's what this jobs report may be telling us.\"\nFor investors who have closely followed the economic narrative over the past several years, this should all feel a bit familiar. Just as consensus believed the US economy was finally slowing to the point where it needed help from the Federal Reserve, the data says otherwise. Escalating fears of a \"hard landing,\" where the Fed's restrictive interest rates send the economy into a tailspin, have quickly moved to discussion about a \"no landing,\" where the economy keeps growing and inflation risks once again emerge.\nThis brings to mind the defining phrase of the surprisingly strong 2023 economy and all the caveats that come with it.\nIndeed, we are, once again, so back. Back to a time headlined by calls for strength in the stock market as the Fed cuts interest rates while the economy remains on solid footing. Back to a time when good economic news is \"good news\" for stocks. \nBut it's a delicate balance. Too much strength could mean once again seeing good news framed as the precursor to an inflation rebound. As our Chart of Day shows, there have been plenty of moments over the last year alone where markets have been rooting for data to cool off. At times, data that's come in weaker than expectations has been cheered by investors fearful of another spike in inflation and interest rates staying higher for longer than initially hoped.\nMarkets appear to be wrestling with what the narrative shift means. After initially rallying nearly 1% on Friday after the jobs report, the S&P 500 was off nearly 1% on Monday. This comes as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added about 20 basis points over the past two sessions to breach 4% for the first time since August. \nThis move in yields represents how market participants are now adjusting to expect fewer interest rate cuts from the Fed as the economy holds steady. A week ago, investors were pricing in a 34% chance that the Fed would cut interest rates by another half a percentage point in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool. As of Monday, investors were pricing no chance of a jumbo-size cut and instead giving a 15% chance to the Fed not moving rates at all.\nFor now, this seems to be acceptable for equity investors. Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon noted that further good economic news could be welcomed by investors \"as long as inflation remains in check.\" At some point, though, the move higher on yields could weigh on investor appetite for risk in the stock market.\n\"If the data continue to improve, long-term rates and commodity prices are likely headed higher, which could put a strain on stocks without [earnings per share],\" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients.\nSosnick said the current economic backdrop leads to a \"tough setup\" for anyone hoping for more interest rate cuts over the next 12 months (yes, we're looking at you, potential homebuyers).\nBut on balance, this is an instance to see the forest through the trees. Fewer interest rate cuts because the economy is doing better than everyone thought isn't a bad thing. If asked to pick between more interest rate cuts or a better economy, Sosnick said he's \"always going to pick the stronger economy.\"\nHe added, \"We should always be looking for a stronger economy because that's really what drives stock prices.\"\nSo, while many things about the economic narrative may be coming back, that framing of rooting for good data to drive corporate profits has never left.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
