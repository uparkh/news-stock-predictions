cryptocurrency,Jan,19fn11w,"I Took Out $94,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Crypto: 19 Month Update","Not financial advice.   Greetings All,    This is my 19 month update since I first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find my previous updates in my post history. The first is from June 2022.   A lot has happened since my last update, so I’ll get right to it…  &amp;#x200B;  First off, I managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000!   Work has been better than usual and I had a big job in December that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance.  Next I decided to buy even more Bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome Credit Card Balance Transfer offers that appeared in August/September…  Two of my credit cards were offering 0% APR for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. I also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. That combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential.   Balance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. Also, I’m only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy.   I ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$26,500. This brings my total amount of Bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 Bitcoin!!!!  **With the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \~$800.**   I can easily afford this. In fact, I’m putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so I don’t end up paying a lot of interest when it’s all said and done. I plan to have everything paid off in less than two years.   \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  **As of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers I have a total remaining balance of \~$56,000.**  It works out like this:  $21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan.  $35,000 from new balance transfer loans.   This brings the total amount of loans that I’ve taken out so far to $94,000. I’ve paid a total of \~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \~$98,500 as of January 24th, 2024.  **I have acquired a total of 4 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.**   **As of today, January 25th, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is \~$40,000.**  **This brings the total value of the Bitcoin I acquired from loans to $160,000.**  **This represents an unrealized USD profit of \~$61,500.**   The math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500  Lastly, I’m officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. I have a nice round number of Bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which I’ve been slowly adding to from earned income. Now it’s time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes.   Let me know if you have any questions.   Not financial advice.",OP is about to inspire some huge mistakes from lesser smart ppl.,Balls of steel.,"ChatGPT'd this for lazy folk like myself.  Here are the basics.  * Total amount of loans taken out: $94,000 * Total interest paid to date: ~$4,500 * Total cost basis of these loans as of January 24th, 2024: ~$98,500 * Total Bitcoin acquired: 4 Bitcoin (~$24,625 per coin) * Current price of Bitcoin as of January 25th, 2024: ~$40,000 per coin * Total value of the Bitcoin acquired from loans: $160,000  Glad it worked out.",Loan sharks love him,Fucking balls of titanium 🤣,Pay off your loans and ride on the profits!,I just didn’t file a tax return that year.

Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&amp;P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month.

Despite this, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw outflows of nearly 38,000 BTC since converting to a spot ETF. Trading volumes for the new spot Bitcoin ETFs increased by 34% on the fifth day, with BlackRock and Fidelity’s ETFs each surpassing $1 billion in assets under management.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

The market, however, views this as a bullish sign, suggesting that a supply crunch could drive Bitcoin prices to new highs.

They can keep doing this for quite a long period of time, this can keep going even after the BTC halving.  There is not enough purchase power to absorb 1 billion worth of BTC sold weekly. (at 40k$) That's literally 21 Billion worth of BTC(525k x 40k).  That's 5 months selling a billion worth of BTC each week at 40k.  I'm also curious why aren't they selling OTC? Aren't there some laws for that? Selling spot on Coinbase every time absolutely kills the market. Who has interest to keep BTC low?

So far the only bullet proof methods have been:  * bisq * LocalMonero/AgoraDesk * And BTC/ETH atomic swaps  But because high fees make the process of decentralized exchange cumbersome with both ETH and BTC most traffic so far went to LocalMonero. Which in itself is a good solution, but as a centralized website lacks the robustness of a DEX like bisq or trustlessness of atomic swaps.  Therefore it's nice to see that both LTC and BCH as low fee alternatives have picked up the topic and BCH in the meanwhile delivered a functional PoC for a third major atomic swap implementation between BCH &lt;&gt;XMR.   _____ We now have at least three atomic swaps implementations for  BTC https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap  ETH https://github.com/AthanorLabs/atomic-swap  BCH https://github.com/PHCitizen/bch-xmr-swap?tab=readme-ov-file#bch-xmr-swap-poc","The main use case of XMR is to buy things at the darknet and do other shady shit, so I doubt delisting it on KYC exchanges will have much impact on its price action.","While some people are nervous about Monero being delisted from some CEX's, this will strengthen XMR's resiliency in the long-term.

Gensler later had to come out on his own Twitter account to debunk the news, which is wild. But regardless of more regulation or not, crypto traders will continue to be crypto traders.  And thus these traders couldn't give up use of leverage which caused 85 Million in liquidations in the hour during the fake tweet incident.   &amp;#x200B;  [Per Coinglass Liquidations](https://preview.redd.it/7bxevkd7vhbc1.png?width=368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f32e93045a32b73f0f7e885adb17f0079d2fe0d)  Interestingly, traders were almost evenly wrecked on the way up and on the way down. Traders went all in on the price spike, and then went all in *again* when the tweet was debunked and the price fell. I *almost*  feel bad for them because in a situation like this, once could really have done all their homework on a token and be absolutely sure of an event that would cause the price to spike.

I'm still incredibly bullish on Bitcoin, but even if it does gain significantly wider adoption, most people are probably going to interface with it through their preferred payment app, or using their CEX's credit card program, or some other similar centralized payment service.  Personally I don't really see that as a huge issue because other options still exist for those who want to use them. There isn't really a one size fits all or perfect solution to transaction trade offs, so having a wide variety of transaction methods with those different trade offs is more important than how many people use each method.",This is the only adoption we want.

Much has changed over the last six years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2023)).  This year’s friendly competition is between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    To mirror traditional index fund products, [**AMKT** also provides a 5% APR match](https://amkt.com/match), creating its own dividend.  Here’s the question I tracked this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***  On 1 January 2023, $1000 was equal to 17.15 AMKT.  Here’s the snapshot, one year later:   https://preview.redd.it/kvyk7mj2ildc1.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44760aeee4a4116f157c0978c562932954de4ca7  **December Performances:**  * **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio**: +25%  * **AMKT**: +18%  The monthly victory goes to: **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio**  **FINAL TALLY FOR 2023:**   * **The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio:** current value $1,729 (+73%)  * **AMKT:** current value $2,407 (+141%)  Overall winner: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**  For the more visual, here’s the table I used to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/k4wpvt76ildc1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f7c1057e3787e43711c0fcdfdc871b497aa4988  That’s a wrap on the 2023 Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition.  In the end, it really wasn’t close – **AMKT** took 9 out of 12 monthly victories and held the overall lead throughout 2023, returning +141% vs. my Top Ten’s 73%.  Not bad for doing nothing.  ## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   The 2023 Top Ten is one of six concurrent experimental portfolios.  Where do we stand if we combine all of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -10% (total value $903) * 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +355% (total value $4,548) * 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +474% (total value $5,739) (***best performing portfolio****)* * 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +139% (total value $2,393) * 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -52% (total value $484) (***worst performing portfolio****)* * [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +73% (total value $1,729)  Taking the six portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line:   **After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$15,796.**   **That’s up +163%** on the combined portfolios.     For context, the peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.    Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:  https://preview.redd.it/9nkcb028ildc1.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c9c10fa381c105ba081598b7eebc51d38bf88b0  In summary: ***That’s a +163% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years***.  ## Comparison to S&amp;P 500  I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  https://preview.redd.it/37hykek9ildc1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aed55dabb82498ab4c019fb2b28775ec49fb0e1b  The S&amp;P 500 is up +24% so far in 2023, compared to the Top Ten Crypto portfolio’s +73%.  The initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,240 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.    Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1000 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,240 today  Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:   **After six $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $8,670.**  That is up **+45%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+163%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.   The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/wvinnynaildc1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01246b72f5a10576bd0f3705088e68b7e7df7498  ## Conclusion:  That’s a wrap for the first year of the 2023 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment.  It ended up being a very solid year, despite some bumps along the way, par for course in crypto.  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

From another comment, I'll copy and paste the winners since I started these Top 10 portfolios in 2018:    2018 - BTC (+243%)        2019 - ETH (+1648%)        2020 - BNB (+2174%)        2021 - BNB (+723%)        2022 - BTC (-4%)","For 2023, correct.

cryptocurrency,Jan,1ac8opd,Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF Is Shutting Down with a Loss of 15%,,This happened because Cramer went bullish on it.,1. Why shut it down now? 2. How can you be at a loss inversing his predictions?,"&gt; How can you be at a loss inversing his predictions?  Because despite the meme, he's not as wrong as people make them out to be. He's just on TV and social media a lot which means he says a lot of things and some of those are bound to be very wrong.  Dont get me wrong, he's not some investing genius either. IIRC, he underperforms the market, but he's not bad enough that investing him would make you money in the long term.  Example: S&amp;P goes up 5%, Cramers picks go up 2%, investing Cramer would lose 2% (assuming they're shorting his picks).",The equivalent of 2 cats taped back-to-back landing on the ground.,That’s actually incorrect.   The ETF likely closed because of decay (the cost to rebalance &amp; manage a etf) the problem was the fund had only $2.4 million in assets.   There was a long Cramer ETF which closed for the same exact reason way before the inverse Cramer closed (which means the long inverse made even less money than the inverse) which is not enough assets to maintain  the rebalancing and managing cost.  Inverse Cramer was actually very profitable but as a retail trade.,Can some explain to me how both the short and the long Jim Cramer lose money?  Does that mean no matter how you invest with Jim Cramer you lose money?  That quite a record!,"tldr; The Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (SJIM), designed to bet against the stock recommendations of TV personality Jim Cramer, is shutting down after losing 15% since its launch in March 2023. The ETF's closure follows its sibling ETF, Long Cramer Tracker ETF (LJIM), which was shuttered in September 2023. SJIM will cease trading on February 13, having accumulated only $2.4 million in assets.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.","Can you explain more? The fund is down 15% in 2023. Are you saying that all of that loss is attributed to decay, because I'm not sure I buy that.",You’re misunderstanding the article which has a misleading headline. Yes the ETF is down 15% but that is not the reason it was shuttered (though it didn’t help).  There was not enough assets in the ETF which means the ETF was not easily diversified this means that rebalance to substantial effort. Rebalancing is done by humans who charge money for managing the ETF add that with the decay which is caused by “volatility drag” and the fund becomes pointless to keep open especially if it falls down 1 single month 15% (15% was just a catalyst for the shutter not the reason)   The article even states that the design of the ETF was the issue not the inverse stocks picked.,You can't say that something is incorrect and then proceed to guess.
cryptocurrency,Jan,192h004,El Salvador's BTC Bet Is $13M in Profit as Bitcoin ETF Approval Approaches,,What people tend to forget is El Salvador was largely off map and forgotten in geopolitical terms. It's never been been featured in the global media and it's economics discussed so much since the whole Bitcoin thing.  Revenue from Bitcoin tourism has massively increased compared to the actual Bitcoin expenditure in addition to cost savings for international remittances.   Sure on bitcoin transaction and wider adoption terms in the country.. has been limited/ slow and timing of the investments poor however long-term bitcoin has a tendency to forgive these things and favor the early adopter. I really hope this is the case for El Salvador and wish them all the best for the future.,"tldr; El Salvador has made a profit of $12.6 million on its Bitcoin investments, having bought 700 BTC at prices ranging from $47,250 to $52,670 starting in September 2021. The country's average cost for its total holdings of 2,798 BTC is $42,440. Bitcoin's price has risen by 75% since October, partly due to anticipation of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approval. El Salvador was the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.",What profit? Unrealized gains maybe?  13m for a country is absolutely nothing.,All true my best friend is salvadorian he said most people who arent latino. See him as Mexican he says things have gotten better now that people know el salvador exist. If im being honest he gives credit to president alone for his tactics of cleaning the country.  One of those tactic is BTC so that's good.  I also had a long convo with my AT&amp;T tech over the phone he found out I was Hispanic living in LA. I asked how El Salvador was like and he said he loves it that things have changed like crazy  That back then he was scared to walk down the street and now he feels safe.  He really respected the presendent had nothing but good things to say about him. He said they were gonna change the law so he can run for a second term.  From what I heard the president is definitely a badass glad he likes BTC.  Maybe we should vote more 40 year olds into office just a thought.,Good bot,I can commend the president on taking on MS-13!  That has been his greatest gift to improve the quality of life for the average citizen,I've spoken to a diplomat from El Salvador.  He also said there are places in town where you couldn't go at night. It's a night and day difference.  They crisisized their approach at first. But now there have been other Central American countries delegations visiting and meeting with El Salvador officials to learn from them how they did it.,It's also ignoring that El Salvador has also been making a push for surfing tourism. But unsurprisingly the people on the crypto sub seem completely unaware of that and think everyone is traveling to El Salvador to...spend bitcoin?,Even for a country like El Salvador 13 million is nothing.,I am. So far their bitcoin lab is $990m in the hole. Spending a billion to make $13m is disastrous.

Nano uses a novel data structure called **Block Lattice**, which allows each account to have its own blockchain that only the owner can update (I dont quite understand what this means). This reduces the need for a global ledger that records every transaction, and enables Nano to achieve high scalability and efficiency.  Also:  - Nano was originally launched in 2014 under the name **RaiBlocks**, but rebranded to Nano in 2018 to reflect its simplicity and speed. - Nano has a fixed supply of **133,248,290 NANO**, which were distributed through a captcha-based faucet system that ended in 2017. - Nano transactions are validated by a consensus mechanism called **Open Representative Voting**, which allows users to delegate their voting power to trusted nodes on the network. - Nano claims to be one of the most **environmentally friendly** cryptocurrencies, as it does not rely on mining, printing, or minting, and consumes minimal energy per transaction.

Had to download a special app for my bank that allowed immediate payments to trusted friends and make payments like this.   Then you had to download a Bitcoin QT along with the whole blockchain... It didn't feel like the future of money.  Was there for ETH launch, the pump to around 20 bucks in anticipation of the DAO launch, and the massive crash after the whole thing imploded.  Used so many crazy exchanges like btc-e, which seemed to be updated by the Russian Mafia and the constant implosion of other exchanges.

cryptocurrency,Jan,197ir49,"If you have money in Lofty.ai, get it out","I was the person who warned about [Celsius being insolvent](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v29t59/celsius_is_insolvent_please_get_your_funds_out_now/) and got absolutely reamed for it. [Another thread referencing the original](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13wxm0c/one_year_ago_a_fellow_user_made_a_post_with_some/).   One of the major warning signs was that Celsius suddenly started layering on a lot of super annoying procedures to withdraw money from the platform. Mandatory ""verified"" withdrawal addresses, mandatory delays on withdrawals...basically putting roadblocks on top of any method of getting money out of their system, **while depositing was instant and required no additional authentication.**  Lofty.ai, a tokenized real-estate investment platform, has recently (they've never done this) started requiring Authy/2FA authentication, **and** email 2FA code verification to withdraw funds via ACH to **previously-confirmed** bank accounts from their platform. Why would you require verification to withdraw money to a confirmed account?  I've never seen a platform start putting roadblocks in for withdrawals that wasn't on the verge of bankruptcy/insolvency.  I threw ~$1,200 into Lofty to test it out. To be fair, they've paid out (via ACH)......$20.47 so far.   The catch is that in order to completely vacate the platform, you have to sell your shares to another potential buyer.  I might be wrong (hopefully so), but I don't get a good feeling about them now.","Most exchanges require 2FA to withdraw funds. I'm not saying you're wrong about Lofty.ai because I know nothing about them, but 2FA for withdrawal is standard procedure.",basically everyone but the sec uses 2fa lol,"Hey, I'm Jerry, one of the founders and the CEO at Lofty. One of our users alerted me to this post, so I thought I'd chime in and provide some more context.  Lofty is a real estate marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of real estate properties. Anyone can come list a property for sale on Lofty. We tokenize the property for them allowing them to sell to many buyers instead of the traditional method of one seller to one buyer. This opens up real estate investing and ownership to a lot more people, making the asset class more accessible and also greatly improves liquidity for a traditionally very illiquid asset. As a result, when you're making a purchase or sale on Lofty, you're not actually transacting with us. Every transaction is peer-to-peer. We are not a fund or a REIT and we do not invest money on behalf of our users. We also do not own any of the properties you see on the platform.  Instead, every property is owned by a DAO LLC, collectively governed and controlled by all the owners of that DAO. We have a very transparent platform, so all the legal documents, including but not limited to the DAO's operating agreement, its formation docs, property appraisals, inspection reports, and all maintenance bills are publicly available to view under the ""Documents"" tab of a property. Everything I've said up to this point can be verified independently by reading the legal agreements and searching up who actually owns the properties with their respective counties.  As a result, it's pretty much impossible for us to actually scam someone as we just provide the platform while all transactions are peer-to-peer and settle through smart contracts on the blockchain. So yes, you're buying real estate from other people, which means if you want to liquidate your position, you must also sell them to other people. This means the funds never touch our wallets or our bank accounts. We make money through transaction fees taken on every trade on the platform. We recently launched our new AMM + Liquidity pool feature, so that people can stake USDC against houses, earning yield from the trading fees charged by the AMM. In exchange, our users can buy and sell ownership in real estate instantly. You can think of us as building the NASDAQ of Real Estate.  I don't know why, but you seem to believe that requiring 2FA authentication on the platform means we're about to go bankrupt... This is obviously not true. We are very well funded and unlike many other blockchain based businesses, we actually make money to the point where we'll be profitable in a few months given our current rate of growth.  It's true we didn't always enforce strict 2FA, it used to be optional. However, in August of 2023, someone was able to brute force hack some of the accounts of our users who did not have 2FA enabled and had very weak passwords. They ended up stealing funds from a few users, which was very unfortunate. We caught this quickly and started enforcing strict app based 2FA for logins, trading, and withdrawals. This was also done to protect ourselves as when these users had their accounts hacked, they all filed chargebacks on the fraudulent purchases. Because we're a marketplace, it's not like we can offer refunds, other than the trading fees we charge, so we ended up losing \~$12,000 from this incident. While inconvenient, the strict 2FA enforcement does protect our users and us from bad actors.      I'm also not sure why you seem to suggest this was a very sudden change recently. It was put into place right after that security incident in August of last year. We made multiple announcements to our users over email and Discord.      I would challenge you to name a single instance where even though you go through with the 2FA, you still can't withdraw. If you'd like to chat more or ask more questions, feel free to reach out to us at [support@lofty.ai](mailto:support@lofty.ai)      But overall, it just seemed quite odd that someone would associate 2FA, which is pretty standard for financial apps these days to a company going out of business. I just really don't get that logic.",Every exchange I use requires 2FA to withdrawal. Its a standard security practice.  Kucoin even requires both email code and autenticator app.  This is to prevent anyone who might hack your account to drain all the mobey without confirmation,"Ummm Lofty has been doing this for several months now (August 2023 to be exact), so not recently as you stated. And if you were actually paying attention they did it for a very specific reason, user were having accounts drain with out any authentication. So I would much rather have to enter in a 2fa code and a email generated code to confirm a withdrawal.",You even looked up why they implemented 2FA on withdrawals? Because some users got phished and once the attacker gained access to the accounts they could basically drain their account with USDC straight away.,Lofty added mandatory 2fa a few months ago. It might be annoying but it's at least erring on the side of safety.,Not sure if this means anything at all.,OP is too lazy to type in an extra password so the company is going bankrupt is what I gathered.,"I hardly ever use the word FUD because I think it’s over dramatic in 99.99% of cases when someone is just being critical of something they don’t like, but this is the textbook definition of that term. No need to cause a panic over something so benign as 2FA on a real world use case."

I was heavily invested in 2018-2019 when I entered the market but then ended up selling it all into eth which was a really great move, since then I haven’t looked back.   Why do you guys still believe in xrp?? I don’t get it, it’s never a good sign when a coin can’t break its previous highs in a bull run. And you can’t entirely blame that on the SEC case, even without it I don’t think it would’ve gone much higher as payment solutions was not a narrative that got much attention that cycle.. and this cycle coming up I just don’t see people coming in getting hyped about xrp.  It just doesn’t stand out in any facet and I argue its time in the top 10 is coming to an end, it’s still hovering around the same price it was over 5 years ago when I entered the market. You’d be better off with most stocks at this point. what is the reason you’d pick xrp as an investment?? I just get so confused when people still think it’s a good addition to a portfolio","I know a long term bag holder of XRP. He did not sell anything during the pump above $3 in 2017 believing XRP would eventually go to $20 and beyond.   He hyped up XRP big back in 2017-2018 to friends and family and doubled during the 2018-19 bear market, basically ignoring btc/eth. I think some of the reason he still holds is pride and not wanting to admit he was wrong about the way things played out during the 20/21 bull.   Another reason is that the price history of XRP has been to kind of do nothing than have an insane rally for a couple weeks or a month. I think he holds out hope it will happen again, but equally as much fears it will finally pump as soon as he sells for another coin.   Also something I suspect is some people are really into owning a lot of low cost coins and dreaming about a 100x in price. It’s psychological, owning a few bitcoin didn’t sound sexy, owning 20k XRP coins was. Also I know he heard about bitcoin years ago, when it was well under $1000, maybe even $100. I think he felt he already missed out when prices were $1-$5k during early 2017 bull into the 2019 bear. XRP was his shot at redemption since it was $.30 still.",These pessimistic posts lately might be a sign for an upcoming XRP pump. Give it 1-4 weeks.,Theyre bagholding a dream,"Yeah, people marry into their investments. It is something that takes a lot of discipline to separate yourself from your investments. I was married into nano, I was up to $300k when it was $25+, thinking i would cash out 50% once my balance got to like $600k. Fully believing it would,  I held on and saw my investment go down to $200k, $100k, got as low as like $12k or something... during this last run I got out between $8 and $10. I'm really glad I did. Luckily I still made a decent amount of money from it, just no where as much as I could have if I held better investment discipline and manage my risk.  I haven't been in the crypto game for like 2 years now.  A lot of it is just complicated tax stuff in the US and just not having the disposable income to invest.","SEC case was 2020. XRP was delisted from most exchanges. You absolutely can blame most of the lack of price action from the SEC case. Where were you even going to buy XRP, Uphold? Yes, Uphold, where you could buy $2,500/day….  Why should XRP stay at $.90 or pump well beyond $.60 right now? The trial with the SEC is set for April.   Speaking with Ripple Employees, they’ll tell you the SEC case will be done with by end of the year.   “You don’t see people getting hyped on XRP”.   Cool.  That’s the beautiful thing, I don’t know how much it matters if you or many retail investors get excited about XRP. I consult global operations. Ripple Labs is a 1,200 employee enterprise, growing at 5%+ FTE growth per year. They have revenue and can use XRP to continue M&amp;A activity to scale further. They are an enterprise grade crypto company. If BTC and ETH are the largest two by market cap, Ripple Labs is #1 by headcount and overall ability to execute at an enterprise level.  Most consumers will understand video games, and other use cases. Retail traders can get hype on AI/ML, etc.   At no point in your post did I see anything that I would consider relevant information into going into an investment hypothesis. Just hearsay, speculation, and naivety.   If I were invested in Ripple Labs’ XRP token, I would stick to reviewing things like GTM strategies, which were announced at their global “Swell” event. I’d review revenue numbers, customer count, M&amp;A activity, etc.   But you got a feeling huh? If you have an actual counter thesis, that would be interesting to read. Post that when you get time","This sub is such a great reverse indicator. If there was ever a good time to buy XRP, it's right now.",Confucious say Man who marry positions get messy divorces,"Wow, the comments here were pretty negative. I hold XRP and I’ll tell you why.  Everything pretty much follows bitcoin.  With a few exceptions, here and there. But if you zoom out on the chart, you can see it’s pretty identical. XRP missed out on the last bull run because of the lawsuit. It is now the only crypto in the top 10 with black-and-white legal clarity.  A lot of people here will tell you that means nothing. Maybe it doesn’t. But I choose to believe that it will make a difference in the next bull run when institutions choose which coin to purchase.  When all of this fear, uncertainty and doubt pops up, that’s when you want to buy something.  I’m not one of these guys that acts like they know what’s going to happen. I have no idea. Maybe it’ll go to zero! But Ripple has $1 billion in the bank and they paid 250 million to get that legal clarity. They didn’t do that because they don’t have faith in their product.  With them behind the coin and all the partnerships they have, I think we will probably be moving up pretty decently at some point.  We shall see!  The way I see it, the real reason there is so much negativity around this coin is because it didn’t do well in the last bull market because of the lawsuit and when you have to wait seven or eight years for something to happen, that boredom and time will convince you that ANYTHING is a POS coin.  Until it surprises everybody.  🤞🏼","The main price driver in cryptocurrency at present is narratives with the main narrative for XRP being: payment routing, liquidity pathfinding and tokenization. Most chains nowadays seem to be more focused around the integration of turing-complete smart contracts and the XRP narratives seem to have been sidelined for the most part by retail.  There were talks early on in the development of the chain, when Vitalik was an intern at Ripple as to whether or not to include smart contracts on chain. Stefan Thomas, the CTO at the time argued that off-chain smart contracts would be more robust and that the on-chain token should only serve as a value transfer mechanism being low friction for the sake of payments. With an off chain service that would process smart contracts (codius).   After Vitalik left, he decided to stick with the on-chain solution for smart contacts when he went onto develop Ethereum (which sacrificed monolithic scaling for programmability)  This approach had more obvious use cases for retail, creating dapps which would initially parallel some of the use cases in tradfi markets (lending/borrowing markets/ on chain exchanges) and eventually some more experimental financial instruments like Ampleforth, OHM, Curve, Frax, DAO's, liquid staking derivatives etc. Leading to more TVL for the chain / greater price appreciation.  DEFI on XRP in comparison has been garbage compared to the rest of the space (despite it being the first project with an integrated DEX prior to ETH). Any wallet could issue assets to the ledger but without smart contract functionality or codius there was only so much that you could do to spur interest.  I suspect that, despite retail being able to develop to a limited extent on the XRPL, it is not the ultimate target for its use which pertains to liquidity sourcing for cross-currency / cross-asset remittance. Having two formally obscure trading pairs (with conventionally low liquidity) of assets tokenized on ledger like swapping a milk derivative for a uranium CFD and being able to do so with the same liquidity as cash instead of having to wait for T+2 settlement or operational market hours.   XRP is able to do this because the liquidity is sourced from the protocol level and not silo'd inside different DEX's and L2's like it is in ETH and due to the way in which validators process transactions, there is no MEV /frontrunning/sandwich attacks to contend with.  The narrative that XRP is vying for isn't to be another bitcoin, litecoin or ethereum, its trying to be something else entirely. (A bancor perhaps?) Thing is that most of the parties that would use XRP for said remittance are generally heavily regulated and won't touch anything crypto with a 10 foot pole until it has received regulatory clarity, hence the flaccid price action (which is mostly just retail speculating).",I bought a nice bag of XRP back in 2015 at .0057-.0066. I can tell you that when you buy low - *really* low - it's easy to be patient and just watch the market. Why not? You're literally *never* at a loss.

That's certainly a lot better than the current 2% Grayscale currently charges for its Bitcoin trust (not a spot ETF). Invesco is set to convert its trust to a spot ETF with 0.59% and 6 months free, according to a LinkedIn news post.  This comes on the heels of the upcoming SEC Jan. deadline, an actual final deadline, not a kick-the-can-down-the-road date.

cryptocurrency,Jan,198q6da,The Bitcoin Spot ETFs may have just bought nearly 1/50th of available BTC,"Disclaimer! If I've gotten incorrect information then it means what I'm posting is wrong. So over the next couple days more concrete information could come out and completely invalidate this post.  However, right now it is being stated that there were roughly $1.4b total inflow into the ETFs, or roughly 34,000+ Bitcoin being purchased from last week. I've seen some people mix up numbers on GBTC affecting this, but these are the numbers I'm working with.   If true, this means .1667% of all Bitcoin ever was just purchased. AND, this would make up 1.85% of all available Bitcoin on exchanges(1.9mil BTC or roughly $75.5bil). So in the first 2 days nearly 1/50th of available Bitcoin was bought up.  Bullish! Shove that hopium in my face!  More sobering though, Coinbase and other exchanges certainly can have 'more secret wallets' of holdings that could drastically change this number of available BTC. And, it is likely the purchases into the ETFs will slow down and have a lull for weeks or months.   But the implication is that in roughly 120 days, only weeks after the halving, we might have a supply crunch on Bitcoin as available BTC dries up. Price will need to increase to counter this.   Really keen on following the numbers with these ETFs. Delayed finalizing purchases, and OTC purchases, won't affect price much at all, but the supply drying up definitely will. Next 3 months will be exciting!","Wen BTC 1mil dolla? There, I asked the 1mil dollar question.","One thing I’m surprised nobody’s brought up in any article, post, or analysis that I’ve seen is that the general employee rarely changes their 401k investment allocations after they set it up during onboarding. Also, the “20xx Target Retirement fund” people pick just to move on.. it sounds vanilla but the allocations of those funds evolve with market (that’s what the fund management fees are for, no?)  Sure, the impact of the initial “rush” into BTC ETFs has been widely discussed &amp; cross examined - but what I’m curious about is what happens 6mo, 1yr, 3years down the line when every other day another company does a pay run and sends 10% of total payroll over to fidelity to fund the 401k contributions (plus an employer match too at a nice gig). I just can’t help but wonder - even if only 1 in 1000 employees sets a 1% allocation and forgets about it, those sustained inflows over time, in the aggregate, could potentially make a notable impact?   Also isn’t fidelity one of the larger 401k service providers to employers in the US? Kinda a shoe-in, no?",Take a seat in our halving waiting room. It's cozy. And Jeff from HR has donuts.,"this is assuming the employer that sponsors the plan offers one of the bitcoin ETFs as an an available option in their 401k plan.

The bridging from ETH to a L2 is a hassle already, it will be a greater hassle if people own ETH on a dozen of L2s.

cryptocurrency,Jan,197e3hj,Does anyone actually play crypto games?,"Hello everyone,   I’m looking for personal opinions based on your real world experience. I know crypto gaming is a hot topic in cryptocurrency lately for many reasons, mainly for the juicy gains it has provided to investors, but I’m wondering if anyone here has actually played any of these play-to-earn crypto games? If you have played them, which games have you played? And has it been profitable? I’d love to hear opinions as I’d like to try out some of these games for myself.  Playing video games and earning crypto just seems like a win-win situation if you ask me","The overwhelming majority are dogshit. Most of the early iterations have been a crypto drip with a poorly designed game built on top of it. The better way would be to develop a good game first and then integrate crypto.  The one game that I've actually enjoyed is Gods Unchained. It's a TCG and the cards are NFTs so you have true 'ownership' of the cards you get. You earn packs and a small amount of the native token ($GODS) which you can use to buy cards from other players. It's easily the best use case for crypto gaming that I've seen. It's one of the only projects so far that makes sense in my opinion. And it's actually pretty fun if you enjoy TCGs (like Hearthstone).  The problem with crypto gaming is that in order to be play-to-earn, they must be pay-to-win by definition. Otherwise there would be no economy and it would all be worthless. That concept tends to gatekeep a lot of gamers from being interested in the first place.   You won't earn much from crypto gaming. Most importantly, you need to play the game because you think it's fun. God Unchained for example might pay you $1-3 per day which is hardly worth it in terms of making money. But over time, if you like playing it, you'll accumulate a decent little investment (In cards and $GODS).","[Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/), probably the oldest and most established one at this point. Hopefully we'll finally get an early mobile version this month.","I'll expand on GU a little and say that to earn the maximum daily amount, you need to play 10 matches. More wins = more earnings. Higher ""shine"" (quality) decks = more earnings. Higher rank = higher earnings. So to truly max out the earnings, you'd need to be in the highest rank, have a very strong deck to win 10/10, be skilled enough to win 10/10, and have that deck of all diamond cards (probably a $30k investment). Also those 10 matches will take you about 2 hours, so in then end you might average $1 per hour. If you're in it for the money, just get a part time job.  An average player will have none of those things and will earn less. I play it because I find it fun. The value earned is secondary to that and I really don't think about it.","Many have mentioned God's Unchained. That has good fundamental card mechanics like Magic the Gathering, and has the same Financials, so no one complains.  I've also been playing Star Atlas, which is Eve Online without the confusing UI. It works because all assets are tokenized, from the ships to the ammo, and it runs serverlessly, so everything you do is permanent. Makes the game feel VERY MUCH like it has real gains and losses, which is super exciting.  Axie Infinity is OK if you like a tactic card battler. Market leader, though it does get dry after a month.  Shrapnel is a decent shooter ahead of its time as a drop-in-extraction FPS. There are going to be a ton of these types hitting the market in the next 3 years, off crypto, so if nothing else it's good practice.  Have fun!","Yes , i bought a 4070 to play shitty blockchain games.","&gt; The problem with crypto gaming is that in order to be play-to-earn, they must be pay-to-win by definition. Otherwise there would be no economy and it would all be worthless.   Moreover, if you're an unscrupulous developer and are fine exploiting pay-to-win mechanics, there's not much reason to use crypto vs conventional predatory microtransactions, especially as you'll have a much larger audience.  So a crypto game is not only pay-to-win, it must be _overwhelmingly_ exploitative to point of practically being a fraud/scam to make much sense in many cases.  All the incentives align against the games actually being fun.","Those requirements you mentioned are really unrealistic. I play for a year and a half, I never spend a dollar, my cards are mostly meteorite quality and I average about 1:15h per 10 matches, earning around 5 to 8 gods a day.  So you can easily earn around 2 to 3 dollars per one hour while having fun. The only drawback, the first few months are really a hard grind till you can settle your game.","I enjoyed crypto royale for a while. Very simple yet fun, crypto feels secondary to the gameplay.  The issue with most (all?) other crypto games is that there is a huge pay to win aspect. You will never progress far if you aren’t able to put large amounts of money in continuously.   Finally save up enough money for the World Destroyer sword that can beat all content? Too bad, next patch you’re gonna need to buy the Galaxy Destroyer sword if you want to still compete. Your sword is now worth a lot less","No, what juicy gains do you speak of? A question you should ask yourself: Am I making enough money so it's worth my time to play these games, or is the game devs laughing at me because of their ad revenue?","Yeah, myself, my brother, and some friends been playing Illuvium for a while now in the Alpha. We enjoy it. There are multiple games that contribute to Illuvium, so you might enjoy some or all of them.   I’m currently mostly into Illuvium Zero. It’s a base building game that fuels the ecosystem. There’s the Pokémon like aspect (Illuvium Overworld), which I’m not sure if I’ll get into or not. We shall see, but there is a diverse style of choices between the group of what they are into.   Parts of or all of the game goes live this year. I mainly pay attention to Zero, which has a goal to go live Q2. There’s also Arena and Beyond. The IlluviDex is coming together nicely.  I suggest you look into the available games yourself starting with the most popular. In here you find a ton of hate and shit talking. However, some of these games have some serious fast growing communities and interest. For example, the official discord I’m in for Illuvium is extremely active.  They have partnerships with Epic Games, GameStop, and so on. This stuff is going to be very popular and lucrative one day. What will it be is anyones guess, but you can’t win if you don’t play."

AMA!","We’re moving 10 Bitcoin (± $420,000 USD) and a Pudgy Penguin (± $25,000 USD) into a regular Zengo wallet and inviting you to try and steal it. We’re so confident in the robustness of our security model, we’re even sharing some of the 3 wallet recovery factors connected to this wallet.  We built Zengo in 2018 to fix the biggest problem with self-custody: Seed phrases. Zengo is not a hot wallet. Zengo is not a cold wallet. Zengo is a multi-factor MPC wallet: No seed phrase, no single point of failure.  Since 2018, we have over 1,000,000 users and a spotless security record:   * 0 wallets hacked * 0 wallets taken over * 0 wallets drained * 0 wallets phished  We recognize that seed phrase maxis will not be interested in Zengo - but believe that the 99% will.  **So no seed phrase: How does Zengo work?**  1. Using a 2-of-2 Multi-Party Computation (MPC) framework, each of the two Zengo parties (Zengo app on the user device and Zengo server) [independently generate](https://zengo.com/how-keys-are-made/) their own “Secret Share” during the wallet creation process. The secret shares are cryptographically locked to prevent MITM attacks. 2. The share randomly generated on the user’s device is called the Personal Share and leverages the device’s hardware-based random number generator (TRNG). Only the Personal share can initialize and sign transactions, all of which are verified by the device’s hardware (Secure Enclave or TEE/Trusted Execution Environment). 3. The share randomly generated on Zengo’s remote server is called the Remote Share and is used to co-sign transactions emerging from the Personal Share. 4. Using MPC, these two Secret Shares are able to compute their corresponding public key securely.  Even if a hacker gains access to one of the two secret shares, it is still useless to them as they cannot spend user funds.  Lose your phone? The 3-factor wallet recovery process is biometrically locked to the user. More info [here](https://zengo.com/security/).  **The Challenge: Hack a Zengo Wallet, Win 10 Bitcoin (±$420,000)**  This Tuesday (January 9, 2024) we are putting our money where our mouth is.

We will also start sharing some of the security factors that protect the wallet.  **Follow along on this page with updated information regarding the challenge:** [https://zengo.com/zengo-wallet-bitcoin-challenge](https://zengo.com/zengo-wallet-bitcoin-challenge/)  We are also awarding up to $750 in Bitcoin for those who create high-quality content as they try and hack the wallet, or learn about our model (terms apply, see blog for all details).  **We believe that MPC wallets like Zengo will help securely self-custody millions who are stressed about seed phrases - or those who don’t even self-custody today because it’s too hard to do it correctly.**  [MPC is like AA on steroids](https://zengo.com/aa-and-mpc-frens-with-benefits/), and can protect more than just EVM chains, like Bitcoin. We’ve already launched advanced features like [Theft Protection](https://zengo.com/pro-theft-protection/) which lock on-chain approvals to your Biometrics - and you can bet we’re activating it for this challenge!

cryptocurrency,Jan,1999win,"None of the cryptos are actually a security, let's see how the judge dealing with the 'SEC vs Coinbase' case made it clear today for everyone!","Judge Katherine Polk Failla in the case of 'SEC vs Coinbase' made it pretty clear today that none of the cryptos that are sold on exchanges are a security as per the current definitions.   There are 4 conditions on the Howey Test which define a security:  ➡  An investment of money  ➡  In a common enterprise  ➡  With the expectation of profit  ➡  To be derived from the efforts of others     Now, let's take a scenario where a crypto coin covers all of these points. So it must be a security then?    Wrong! The Howey Test was created and taken from the [Sec vs Howey](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/293/)  case from 1946. These 4 components shouldn't be taken out of context. For a security to be a security there must be a signed  'investment contract' which must adhere to all regulations and also gives the buyer many other rights, which none of the crypto buyers actually have. This is the entire point of the Howey case. The 4 components are an addition to help clarify further what is a security but only and only after an 'investment contract' is signed.   None of the exchanges offer such an 'investment contract'. This contract also guarantees that you have the right of cancellation in case of scam. Imagine buying 10,000$ worth of Luna, and Luna rug pulls the next day, Coinbase will literally have to refund you all of the lost money. This is will never happen of course because cryptos are not a security.    When presented with these facts, the SEC couldn't say anything, couldn't respond back adequality and didn't have any counter arguments which speaks a ton.    The Judge clearly showed them that the 'security' laws are outdated for crypto and there need to be new laws written and officially accepted. Currently cryptos are far away from being a security.","SEC shot themselves in the foot going for multiple tokens and against a giant (coinbase).

cryptocurrency,Jan,19cb132,Programmer wondering why to use ETH.,"I have my own little business and have been dabbling in crypto for fun since it came out.  Now, I've had some customers talk about using it in their database systems.    I like ETH and ADA, but I pretty much just sit on it. I figured we'd do some testing with smart contracts to shot the client as examples.  The gas price on Eth was pretty high or the speed was unacceptable.  So, I don't get it?  I like my portfolio getting bigger and all, but I invested in it SOLELY because I saw it as a technology that would dominate the automation of financial software.  But now.... Not so much.    Ada is super fast and cheap in comparison, but I don't know haskell or Rust, but I certainly don't want to spend 200k writing a software that's going to be inefficient or even irrelevant in a matter of years.  Ugh.  I'm really disappointed here.   I now know ""why"" gas is expensive and people have told me 100 ways to bundle, etc... And even more have tried to push me on using chains like sol and nano and xrp, and I guess I'll need to research them.  The thing that is driving me crazy:    If the gas fee is so high due to the networks transaction volume, why do people ""transact""?.   I just sit on mine, so I never even noticed.  I just see the balance go up.  But, who the F actually ""uses"" ETH when deciding to send someone $50 or something?  Why would anyone actually ""use"" ETH to send someone money?  I must be doing something wrong.  I'm praying I'm doing something wrong, because if it's just good for holding, then the justification I used for investing in it is completely wrong.  Something.... One of these chains... Is going to become the standard when developing software.  AWS S3 pretty much standardized storage for us.  S3 and Azure and Google Cloud Storage are practically identical, dominating software.  A million other options just died in ignominy.    So,  Why do people ""transact"" in Eth rather than chains that are literally thousands of percent cheaper and faster? Is there a reason I'm missing?","Because crypto is not comparable to the traditional tech sector.  It's not about the newest, or the fastest, but all about **trust**.  Think about it this way: if you're going to transact (or hold) a large amount of value, would you care more about paying $0.01 vs. $5 in fees, or would care about transacting on a chain that you know will always work, is robust (and battletested) and is highly unlikely to disappear?   Many people on this sub treat crypto like it's just another Silicon Valley sector, but it's far from it. Trust is what matters first and foremost, and the value will always be where the trust lies (which is why most people who transact thousands or more primarily use BTC or ETH).","&gt; But, who the F actually ""uses"" ETH when deciding to send someone $50 or something? Why would anyone actually ""use"" ETH to send someone money?  Most transactions aren't people sending money, the biggest use case is [DeFi](https://defillama.com/), so things like borrowing and lending, swapping assets, various types of futures etc. The second biggest category of gas users are [L2s](https://www.growthepie.xyz/fundamentals/rent-paid).

cryptocurrency,Feb,1as4jx1,Attacks on Bitcoin and Ethereum now 'economically unfeasible': research,,"tldr; Research indicates that attacks on Bitcoin and Ethereum, such as 51% and 34% attacks, are now 'economically unfeasible.' The cost to attack Ethereum on Dec. 31, 2023, would have been $34.39 billion, and for Bitcoin, an attacker would need over $20 billion to produce enough ASIC mining units, which is not possible due to microprocessor limitations. Additionally, collusion with hardware manufacturers is unlikely and would face supply-chain issues. High electricity costs for running the necessary machines also make attacks prohibitive, leading researchers to conclude that the security of these blockchains has evolved to a point where the costs and risks of attacks far outweigh any potential benefits.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.",You could make more money either mining bitcoin or staking ethereum instead of attacking it.   It's genius.,"I agree, but not every reason for an attack is money related.",Good bot.,"Ill add, on ETH, attackers would need at least 6 months to enter the network with their validators due to the limits. Thats after spending that many billion market buying the ETH needed for the attack. This would be pretty noticeable.","Bitcoin's security budget is the amount paid to miners for securing the network. They need to be compensated for their hardware and electricity costs.  At the moment miners get a total of about [$47M per day from inflation/issuance](https://moneyprinter.info/)  and about [$2M per day from transaction fees](https://cryptofees.info/) so the daily security budget is $49M.  Each 'halvening' the amount of bitcoin issued each day reduces by half, so for the security budget to remain constant the price per bitcoin must at least double.  The current marketcap of bitcoin is about $1T, I'm sure it can easily double with the next halvening to $2T and so the security budget will be fine this year... however it can't keep doubling forever.  After 4 more halvenings (so 2040) the marketcap would need to be $32T in order to have the same security budget as it does today. There is only about $35T in all bank accounts and cash (narrow money) in all fiat currencies combined.  2 more halvenings (2048) and it needs to be at $128T, which is more than all broad money in existence (so 'narrow money' plus money markets, time deposits etc).  The only options I can see for Bitcoin are either to follow BitcoinCash and make bigger blocks (which as we saw in the 'blocksize wars' is likely to be very contentious) so that more transactions and therefore more fees can be collected; or alternatively to abandon the 21M limit and change to a steady issuance that will keep the miners paid... but obviously would upset all the laser-eyed morons who have no idea how the network operates but have just been sold on the easy narrative of 'limited supply = price go up'.",Some men just want to watch the world burn.,How is that a new thing?   Attacks on bitcoin were feasible 12 years ago when price was low and nobody even bothered to start an attack.  that window of Opportuniy is long gone.,"&gt; which is not possible due to microprocessor limitations.  Well, it doesn't have to be new hardware. A resourceful attacker could purchase or confiscate existing mining hardware and use it in their attacks.","I appreciate you sharing your feelings, but this paper was objectively about the cost of a network attack at present. I was speaking about exactly that: the cost and difficulty of an attack at present. If you think it will be irrelevant in 10 years, that’s nice, but your comment doesnt address the topic in any way.  Similarly, we can entertain the idea that bitcoin may disappear in 10 years, it still doesn’t change the fact that it’s expensive to attack today."

The cost of both power and equipment capable of providing significant hashrate is borderline unprofitable as it is already with miners going under during certain periods of a cycle.   Both systems are going to eventually run into the same problem any financial system has which is consolidation of wealth.  It's quite literally unavoidable without government intervention.  A finite supply doesn't change that, nor does a supply that gradually inflates.","Mining sells to be profitable.  Which means surplus.  Which means they are able to sell what they mine and have more than what they put in.  Which means you are able to sell exactly at break even and maintain a positive inflow of BTC.  This isn't rocket science, both POW and POS expend capital to generate more coins.    And if you want to argue that POS doesn't burn capital on electricity so it allows ""accumulating of wealth"", just know percentages don't change.  If person A staked $1000 of ETH and person B staked $10,000 ETH at an annualized rate of 5%, they'll have the exact same percentage of ETH in relation to each other after 20 years.  There was no advantage or consolidation of wealth beyond what was already there to begin with.  The person with more money in both POW and POS will always consolidate wealth because they have more money in fiat.  No mechanism in crypto solves what some people in this thread are complaining about.  If nobody could put any more money into crypto all things stay as they are now and nobody gains an advantage.  But that's not how a financial system works.  There's inflows of fiat.  And people with more fiat will have more of everything.  When there's a crash, the poor sell their assets and the rich hold and buy more.  That's where accumulation of wealth happens.  And it's inevitable and unstoppable.

cryptocurrency,Feb,1ai1j8s,Where will smaller bitcoin miners go after the halving?,"Every time there is a bitcoin halving smaller miners get priced out of mining and go to another chain to try and maintain a profit.   What proof of work chain do you think smaller bitcoin miners will go after this halving?  Litecoin or Dogecoin? Does a bitcoin mining setup translate to these chains? BCH?   I am curious because I believe after the halving and miner migration the prices of the new proof of work chain that miners move to will see a surge in its price.   Although I am not in crypto for a quick buck I am just curious where this is headed, and may invest a small amount and see where it gets me.   I see a future where 2 or 3 proof of work coins will exist.",The halving is going to be extremely hard on miners of all sizes. Mostly it will be hard on miners who pay more for electricity. The small miners who have been finding ways to mine with waste energy will actually be better off than the big miners who can’t lower their electricity prices to $0.00,They might maintain profitability but the reward is getting cut in half. They’ll be worse off until BTC at least doubles in price.,To exactly the same place they were when bitcoin was half the current price 6 months ago...,"True. Waste energy miners are a weird animal though and they tend to be small. They effectively have no operational costs (electricity) and their only cost is capital expenditures up front, which means they don’t have an incentive to shut off when difficulty goes up or the reward goes down. I expect this will become more and more apparent over time. The only big miners that will be able to keep up are utility scale miners that are getting great deals by helping to balance electrical grids","I think electricity rates are more relevant than the size of the mining operation. For instance, if you’re stealing power to mine BTC that halving will reduce your pay but it will still be profitable. Why would they quit? Same goes for miners in areas that have cheap power rates.",Do you know about asic resistant PoW?  Like ergo.,"I was probably in that category, I had my miner automatically turn on at sunrise and it just uses my excess solar which also heats the house in winter. Unfortunately the rewards are so low it’s not even worth the “free” solar now. We still get a grid feedback tariff on solar at like $0.05/kW and the times  when there is cloud cover the high electricity is a killer.","... and miners were closing up shop left and right.  Yes, it'll be exactly back to that.",It's funny how little all of these commentors understand mining. Bitcoin is mined using ASICs. Those ASICs are locked into mining the SHA-256 algorithm. The only real alternative would be BCH/BSV or a low market cap like $SPACE.,"You are saying that the bitcoin price will double within 2 weeks of the halving? History doesn’t show that to be a likely occurrence.   The only other way profits adjust is by the miners who are no longer profitable dropping off and reducing the competition for the reward. Hashprices are going down in the long run, which means profitable energy costs are too. The halving is a shock that accelerates this dynamic."

cryptocurrency,Feb,1ag9inp,Day trading is too stressful and the profit is not worth it despite being profitable.,"it's been a year and a half since I started day trading but man it's become so stressful I can't bear it anymore. I mean I am profitable and all, still losing some days but I do end up with some profit in the end, the point that I am trying to drive home is that throughout this trading journey that I boarded on, I noticed my relationships with most people around me especially family and close friends start to dwindle a lot!t I have almost stopped hanging out with my friends when they ask me to hang out with them just to look at the charts, 90% of the time I would make up an excuse to not go with them and all this is starting to take a toll on me, even my family started to notice my changed behavior.  and to add to that the profit that I am getting out of this is not really compensating for the amount of stress and brain fog that I have developed from it, and that pushed me to start thinking about long-term investing and ending this trading mess that I have started, I mean I see people around me living their lives going to their day jobs getting paid and enjoying their time and not having to worry a bit about the market price and if whether they are in the red or green for that day, I even have some friends that are investing a percentage of their monthly paycheck into crypto waiting for the next bull run, and here I am trading my time looking at the chart of different coins all day following a bunch of indicators, patterns, sketching a bunch of support and resistance lines trying to catch a trend, pullback or reversal.  so to everyone who is reading this let me tell you day trading and scalping you name it is so freaking stressful, and you should really consider that when trying to start a journey in it. because really this stress and level of anxiety that i currently have is so not worth it (for me atleast).  It could be that I am just not cut out for it or wrong about it, either way, I am only hodling from now on, and trying to start another career in something way less stressful than day trading crypto could ever be.  hope the best for you all.",Depends how much money youre playing with.. it requires a lot of money to make mad money.,Sounds more like a gambling addiction.,Becoming a millionaire is super easy if you start with a billion,"you know, now that I look at it I think you are right because although I stopped day trading for 3 days now  I keep having that gut-wrenching feeling of missing out aka FOMO but I will pull through.","day trading is very risky. You win 9 times and lose one time, but that one defeat sweeps away the previous wins. That's what I'm enduring right now and it sent me to depression.   When you keep on winning, it gets over your head and you start to feel undefeated. You see that it's possible to make a million from there. You are unstoppable.   Another thing about day trading is that small capital will get you nowhere. And small capital means you have to frequently trade to see remarkable gains but it only takes one bad trade to reset your game.   When we read about greed, we don't understand its meaning until we experience it ourselves. The reason you trade everyday is because you are greedy but you are not aware of it until you hit rock bottom.   When we win, we feel like we have mastered the market but when we lose, we go quiet.   But one thing about day trading is it teaches you to be resilient and humble.",If you’re winning 9 times and losing 1 time but that one defeat “sweeps away the previous wins” then you’re not using appropriate risk management or risk:reward ratio in your trades.

Fast forward to today, I check my crypto portfolio a couple times a week to see what market sentiment in like, but I’m not really moving anything. Waiting with an exit strategy at key numbers. I will never go back to that obsessive trading mentality.","-Day trading is extremely stressful, especially in an already very volatile and risky asset like crypto, you'll burn yourself out, completely.  -You are getting into serious gambling territory by day trading crypto and you'll become addicted, that will impact your emotional well being and probably create problems on your relationships be it partner, friends, family.  - 99% of people day trading crypto will either lose money or make less profits than strategically placing mid-term and/or long-term entry and exit points.   -As you very well said, even if somehow you belong to some genious minority that consistently makes money by day trading crypto, ""the profit is not worth it"".  I am into crypto since 2016, very successful. More than anything else I've learned 3 things. Firstly people expect the price will move where they want it to move. Rarely happens, trade was based on emotion rather than strategy, huge and more often than not, costly mistake. Secondly the huge majority are gambling rather than investing. Thirdly the really smart people who make money consistently long term have an investing rather than gambling profile.   When we ride a sudden coin pump we all feel like genious traders.

cryptocurrency,Feb,1ameivz,Bank called me to ask about my crypto deposit [CAN/ON],"2 days ago I sent about 5K from my crypto account to my main bank account.  That amount transaction isn't out of the norm for my account but it was the first time It was coming from my crypto account. (im aware and ready for tax implications).   Anyways, this morning I get a call from my bank asking if I had approved that transaction, that it seemed suspicious and my funds are locked for 3-5 business days.   I got their employee number and all that stuff.  They gave me the number to call them back and I verified online while still on the call it was actually the banks fraud department #.   I told them I did approve it and i wanted the funds released. (I also checked online and funds were frozen). They said they have to go over some questions.   What cryptocurrency was that 5k from,  How long did I hold it for,  And then they really pissed me off when they asked for the crypto account info and mainly the address. Thats when I stopped them and said I want to go in for a in person appointment before I give any further details, they were fine with that and said to bring all the documents they asked for. (im guessing they meant txid and wallet info), so now I got an appointment at my local branch on monday.   I dont mind answering their questions even though I feel like its my right not to. But I definitely don't want to be giving them my wallet addresses.   Has this ever happened to anyone before?  If so what was the end result?   Im pretty pissed right now because I don't feel this was a big amount to throw some flags with their fraud department.  They locked a good amount of my money for a crypto deposit.... Keep in mind i've been with them for over 12 years and have multiple withdrawals from my bank to my crypto account over the last 6 years. Never an issue. As soon as money came back its a problem.

The report also highlights the rise of Inscriptions, NFT-like collectibles on the Bitcoin blockchain, which have generated significant transaction fees and could help maintain network security through increased fees.

cryptocurrency,Feb,1ap8eu1,UPDATE: Bank Froze my accounts for a 5K withdrawal from crypto account,"Update: Sorry for the long read... I guess I just needed to vent to some crypto people...   Long story short they unfroze my accounts and I closed the account. No wallet addresses or locations were given other than the one they already knew about which was Kraken  So went in, it was the branch manager and another man who didn't tell me what their position was and I forgot to ask, (im assuming he was part of the fraud department) Btw I only brought a screenshot of the completed sell order that was the 5k I sent to my bank account.   They said it was the system that flagged the transaction and then a agent gets my profile to call me. W.e, fine.   They said there is alot of feaud and scams in crypto bla bla bla so any large amounts get flagged and the accounts frozen because then they aren't sure how much of my money (inbound or out) can be related to crypto activity and possible scam/fraud money.   I asked them to pull up all my EMT to my crypto account. They had to search for it lol... I made a joke ""I thought you guys would have done your homework before I came"".... I was the only one who laughed at that one 😅 They pulled them all up and I asked ""so basically.... You think Im the one doing the scamming right? Because if I was the one BEING scammed you would of flagged these transactions before, ehat if I was being scammed and you just let alllll those emt through"". They didn't have an answer for that and reverted back to their robotic ""we need to ensure all funds are coming from a legitimate source yadda yadda bs"" he asked for the agents info which I had luckily.   Anyways the amount I sent out was way more than the amount I received back. I told them how their agent on the phone sounded clueless and was asking me for my addresses and all and I told them my tax guy said bank cant ask for that.   The fraud guy said ""are you sure they asked that""? As if to say im lying. (at that moment I wished I recorded the call)  But he said we dont require the addresses, balances or location, we just need to be sure the funds aren't from illegal activity.   So I showed them the 1 sell order for 5K the dates lined up. The screenshot wasn't good enough so I showed it to him on my kraken account.  And that was it.  They said they will have my account unlocked in 24-48 hrs.   And this is where I started becoming a dick. I told them im not leaving this branch until its all released right now. They made a bunch of excuses as to why they can't and I just said figure it out il be here.   So I sat in their waiting area, watching 3 of the staff run around juggling phone calls for an hour and a half (I can tell this was the managers first time dealing with something like this because she kept asking the ""fraud"" guy for guidance. Finally they came and said its all released.   I said fantastic....now close it all. (this was my victory moment. I wish I could take a picture of their face 😂.   They said oh why, youve been with us so long yadda yadda. I said doesnt matter. Close it all and give me a cheque.  First they said (😂) ""we cannot give you a large sum of money like that for your own safety""  I laughed and said. The only people doing the robbing here is YOU guys. Il be fine.  So now again another hour of them running around. Doing some computer shit asking me random stuff about how I want the cheques, ""what bank will you switch to"" we can offer you a VIP GIC account for free 1.7%"" they gave me the cheques.   At the end... I asked the guy... So...  You guys are so worried about crypto fraud.   How do you know every EMT or cash withdrawal/deposit isn't being used for a bag of blow, or a hooker, or some underground cock fighting ring 😅 I finally got a laugh out of the robo cop, and he said its just bank policy and its the system who flags the transactions. We dont pick and choose which transactions to freeze.  I said "" you say"" we....we who?  The bank right?.... Who do you think programs the system on what to flag"" and I know he knows this so im baffled why he would give such a dumb response like that.... Its because he doesnt have one!   And that was it.   Almost 3 hrs of nonsense for 5k...  What sucks is I still have a mortgage with them and now. Id love to change that too but im on a 5 years fixed with a low rate. Need to see if it would be worth it to renew somewhere else mid term.

I learn something new everyday and this token is apparently named after the SuperVerse.   Before getting phished, the victim was a top 10 bag holder of SUPER.  This is yet another case of the CREATE2 function getting exploited.

The scammer generates fresh wallet addresses for each malicious signature.    Once the victim falls into the trap, the scammer creates a contract that transfers all of the user's assets, bypassing most security checks.

These look the same in wallet provider interfaces because addresses are too long and get shortened to things like ABCDE ...X02FT, without all the characters in the middle.   Then, through whatever phishing means necessary (often a bait airdrop), they get you to accept a contract from new address B (with no history) because it looks like address A (which will be pre-loaded with fake transactions to make it look like it's doing a giveaway/airdrop whatever). the contract asks for a benign sounding transaction permission consistent with an airdrop or giveaway, but the permission actually grants full control, and the contract drains your account.  Some whale-hunting variants don't require phishing at all - they check your wallet for past transactions and then generate a wallet address that looks like it.

The only thing I don't get it, how do you generate 2 addresses with the same end characters? Is there a method of generating a known string?  Edit: Answered my own question. The address of any smart contract is determined by the creators address and a nonce. As new nonces created from the same address are always sequential, you can know the address of the next contract created by that address providing no other transactions have occurred in the interim.","LPT: if you want to hunt for airdrops, don’t use your main wallet.

The mainstream news has been rather mute on the topic of crypto, probably because it's still deemed as a sore point for many who FOMOed in, lost money, then paper handed back out.  Well I guarantee that even the most crypto-sceptic news sites will be jumping on the opportunity for the clicks that the headline ""BTC hits new all time high price point"" will bring in.  So get ready for the tidal surge of new people in this sub asking how they can invest grandmas re-mortgaged house into 'that internet money.'  Also remember to get your sell plan ready in your mind and don't be swept up in the frenzy that 'line can only go up'.",We will likely correct before breaking ATH so that retail noobs get wiped out .

The company, led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, now holds approximately 190,000 Bitcoins, which is almost 1% of the circulating supply. MicroStrategy began investing in Bitcoin in 2020 and has continued to buy more, with their holdings now worth around $9.1 billion.

cryptocurrency,Feb,1b2b67f,Crypto hasn't even begun to melt faces - A Market Risk Analysis,"FOMO and Greed is slowly creeping up again. Can you feel it? Some Data  I've been looking at suggests this is just the beginning. Let's put this sentiment into context by looking at different Market Risk Indicators. **TL;DR**, we've got ways to go before we reach market risk similar to the last ATH.  **Fear and Greed Index (**[link](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)**)**   https://preview.redd.it/994b1jusxclc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=795071f5a0fb0e9c0d1aa630baa5230a506d09a0  We all know the Fear and Greed index, so no need to explain what it is.     In November of 2020 we were close to touching the old 20k ATH, sitting at about 18k USD. The Fear and Greed Index indicated a market  risk of 88. Today, approaching the old 69k (nice) ATH at currently 61k, the F&amp;G indicates 82 risk. Back then Bitcoin more than tripled in value and the F&amp;G Index stayed in extreme greed territory for almost a whole year. Go figure.     **Alphasquared (**[link](https://alphasquared.io/)**)**   https://preview.redd.it/8idkr7kvxclc1.jpg?width=1868&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cab42eeec7d236d85e2b0f5273a4485762c3bc89  Similar story here. This is an indicator I've been using for the past year to stack during the bottom and it's been unbelievably accurate. I'll use this mainly to DCA out starting at 80 risk.     In November of 2020, risk sat at 56 before breaking the ATH of 20k. Today, we're at 56 Risk too, close to breaking the ATH of 69k.  **Rainbow Chart (**[link](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/)**)**  https://preview.redd.it/xj7hcp83yclc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a4e7868a38cbfd81f079bc08ef1e1e8ac06aa3f  The Rainbow chart overlays a log-trend to the price of Bitcoin.     Same date for the dot in the image. We were close to reach the HODL range (middle, yellow line) at 18k. Now, we're very close to reaching the very same band with ways to go before we reach any of the red bands  we got to the last cycle.     **Pi Cycle Top** ([link](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/pi-cycle-top-indicator/))  The Pi Cycle Top Indicator looks arbitrary to me and I wouldn't put  too much weight onto it, but it shows momentum of the market by looking at the 111DMA and 350DMA. The closer they are, the closer we might be to a top. This is the most arbitrary indicator in this bunch, but I wanted to include it. Same story, the current risk is very close to what is was in 2020 at 18k and we have ways to go before they intersect.     **Verdict**   Looking at these different indicators is telling. We could be entering new ATHs within the next few months and there's plenty in store. The recent movement feels like a lot, but putting it into the  context of data analysis, there's way more to go.",It's interesting to me that BTC is almost at ATH and alts are unphased with many of them still down 80% from 2021 highs.,"I wasn't asked by my relatives how to buy crypto, we still have green candles ahead of us",That's Bitcoin for you. We won't see a true alteason until retail gets bored when BTC consolidates on a new ATH for a while. That's been the kickstarter for the past altseasons.,Happy green dildo day everyone.,Great explanation. Knowing the cycle dynamics during the previous one would have saved me a ton of headache and a lot of losses.,Exactly! We're at the same point we used to be at 18k back in 2020. There's so much room left.,"I've been through enough of these to have an intuitive sense of what's going on sentiment wise.  These markets always have one of these early on. No telling where it stops, but after there's a sizeable retrace. People get excited until the retrace and then they get sad, start calling it a bull trap and that goes on for a little while. Then it happens again, bigger, another retrace, some people saying it's a trap, lots of people saying it's going to a zillion. Slowly sentiment builds to the point people think it's going to continue forever. A little after you start seeing that shit is when it's bear time.","I've seen many times that it takes three btc cycles to ""figure it out"" and make appreciable money","Not buying alts when you know theres an alt season is like actually why lol  You have an empty bag and its about to rain money, all you have to do to collect is open it lol  Throw a dart on a board at any random altcoin and it will go up 2-5x. Just don't be an idiot and hold onto a shitcoin through the bear market (like me).   Easiest way to prevent this just have a 20% stop loss on any alt you buy, with take profits at +50% +100% +150% or whatever u want, with a trailing 20% SL to catch the gains   That's pretty fucking safe imo",Oh altcoins will run this cycle
cryptocurrency,Feb,1aw9y3x,Is it true that reliance on a specific client can pose a threat to the security of the Ethereum network?,"I recently came across an article highlighting a significant concern within the Ethereum ecosystem: the heavy reliance on a single client, Geth, which raises questions about Ethereum's vulnerability to software bugs.   Despite the availability of multiple clients like Nethermind, Besu, Erigon, and others, Geth remains the most popular choice, especially among large staking providers.  This centralization poses a risk not just in terms of security but also for the network's resilience. A bug affecting a widely-used client could disrupt a substantial portion of the network, as was the case in January when an issue took down 8% of Ethereum's validators.  Given the critical role client diversity plays in the ecosystem's health, what are your thoughts on how we, as a community, can encourage more widespread adoption of various clients?   Do you think initiatives like Coinbase's efforts to diversify their infrastructure are enough, or should there be more concerted efforts across the board?   What measures can individual users, developers, and stakeholders take to contribute to this diversity and enhance Ethereum's resilience against potential software bugs?  Articles I Read:    1. [https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/02/21/how-centralization-keeps-ethereum-vulnerable-to-software-bugs/](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/02/21/how-centralization-keeps-ethereum-vulnerable-to-software-bugs/) 2. [https://www.blocknative.com/blog/ethereum-client-diversity](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/ethereum-client-diversity)","Yes, with caveats. There has been a lot of progress since the articles you've shared when:   &gt;""a single execution client is responsible for 78% of the execution client market.""  That number is down to 69% now:  https://clientdiversity.org/  [Obligatory 'nice']  The risk from a supermajority is 66.7%, so we're not quite there yet, but not far off.  It's also worth noting that while this is a particular Ethereum problem, that's only because the vast majority of blockchains only have one client... so if there's a bug in that the network just goes offline. Ethereum is more resilient because there are lots of different clients, written in different programming languages and developed by different teams, however we only get the full benefit of that if we can keep a single client from being too popular. Luckily that seems to be happening now at last!","&gt; this is a particular Ethereum problem, that's only because the vast majority of blockchains only have one client... so if there's a bug in that the network just goes offline  This needs to be highlighted: Ethereum is one of the only protocols even _trying_ to have multiple clients.","Hey, you raise a really good point. I also read those articles about how relying too much on Geth could make Ethereum more vulnerable. It's kinda risky having so many folks use the same client.  I think it'd be smart if more validators and developers started mixing it up and running different clients like Nethermind or Besu. That way, if one client has issues, it won't take down a huge chunk of the network again. More diversity equals more resilience.  But I get that people like sticking with what they know - Geth has been around the longest so it feels tried and true. Still, it couldn't hurt for everyone to branch out a little. Maybe if the Ethereum community and leaders put out some guides on switching clients, that could help smooth the transition?  Smaller players like us can help too just by running alternative clients on our own nodes. Even Coinbase is trying to diversify, so that's a good sign. This is one area where we all need to pitch in for the health of the network. More client diversity = less risk of major disruptions next time there's a bug.",[deleted],"Have you seen what has happened with Cardano and Solana when the one single client they use experiences issues? The entire network gets taken offline.   Compare that to a network that is run on 4-5 clients, each with a good amount of network representation. If there is a bug in one client, all the other ones will continue running and the entire network won't go offline.","Nethermind is super easy to set up too, no problems whatsoever, running on an ARM board (Rock 5b) with Nimbus as the CL.  Try it.","Precisely,     So this is actually a selling point for ETH.    It's a generic problem with ALL Cryptocurrencies and ONLY Ethereum currently has a solution.","Thanks for the Articles, I am unaware about that.","Relying too much on one client for the Ethereum network can be a bit risky. It's kinda like having all your chips on one bet, if something goes wrong with that client, like a bug or a security issue, it could mess things up for the whole network. That's why it's important to have a variety of clients running, it helps spread out the risk and makes sure the network stays strong and secure. That's my idea, but for more tips check Opingo that's the spot, don't miss it",[removed]

At the time of writing, it stands at $57.2K.  The buying fever of financial giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity for Bitcoin explains this upward thrust in the price of Bitcoin, which nothing seems able to stop in the immediate future.  Every day, more BTC units are absorbed by these financial giants.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing from the point of view of the Bitcoin revolution and the fact that it takes us further away from everyday use of Bitcoin as a means of payment and exchange by the general public, we have to admit that it's happening.  BlackRock has just held a private event at which several strong ideas were pushed to institutional investors.  The BlackRock analyst himself explained that a 28% allocation to BTC in a portfolio is ""not unreasonable"".  https://preview.redd.it/2y0bk5t7j9lc1.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d3c30593826b6d9e5ded61abbbd35925b6f659d  The analyst is promoting BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF here, but it should serve as an electroshock to the general public that Bitcoin is now an opportunity not to be missed.  The key here is to get the message across that ownership of Bitcoin only exists when it's done directly by taking possession of the private keys. Not an easy task, but it's the message we need to get across as Bitcoiners.  Even more interesting is the fact that, despite the current price of Bitcoin, the term ""How to buy Bitcoin"" is at a very low level on Google Trends.  https://preview.redd.it/eb8r5sc9j9lc1.png?width=2928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2c12221dec277b12f26e090566aae3b0f62bec6  This is a far cry from the level reached in the summer of 2023, the level reached at the end of 2022 when the FTX scam came to light, and even farther from the level reached at the end of 2017 when the price of Bitcoin practically reached $20K for the first time.  Just imagine what's going to happen to the Bitcoin price when the fourth Bitcoin Halving takes place and retail investors start coming in to buy Bitcoin.  It's going to be massive, and forecasts of a Bitcoin price above $100K by the end of 2024 are gaining momentum in my opinion. [**Tom Lee of Fundstrat even believes that the price of Bitcoin could reach $150K**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/the-4-factors-that-will-push-bitcoins) due to the combination of the first two factors, Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin Halving.  To these two factors, we must add the Fed's monetary policy pivot, which will probably take place in mid-2024.  In short, all factors will converge at the same time to push the price of Bitcoin to heights never seen before.  Throughout this unprecedented bullish surge, the key will be to prevent people from ending up lost in Sh\*tcoins by giving in to greed, as happens in every Bull Market.  To do this, the key will be to remind people again and again of the profound meaning of the Bitcoin revolution, and above all, that the purpose of Bitcoin doesn't change whatever the price of Bitcoin in weak money.

The sentencing, scheduled for March 28, 2024, could potentially result in a lighter verdict due to FTX's plans to repay customers. District Judge Lewis A.

cryptocurrency,Feb,1apnla0,Buying is Easy. Selling is the Hard Part.,"Just a brief post from a seasoned crypto investor.  I saw a lot of people coming out of the last bull market (in the bear market of 2022) regretting they held onto all their coins. They saw huge gains in 2020/21 and didn't sell near the top. Naturally, they wished they took more profits in retrospect. The lesson learned was ""Next time, I'll take profit"".  Obviously, that would be a great play in hindsight. Selling ETH at $4800, BTC at $60K+, or ADA at $3. Most altcoins fell 95%+. BTC/ETH fell 80% from highs. We think to ourselves, ""Damn, I was too greedy. I should have sold more coins.""  Part of this is the benefit of hindsight. At the time some of these coins seemed clearly overpriced. Solana at $200+, doing more than 100X in the bull market. Plenty of 20X+ coins that really had no major usage yet (NEAR, DOT, ADA). Still, at the time, did you really think the prices were that crazy? Probably not, because if it was really that clear that the prices were going to crash soon, you absolutely would have sold them at the time.  Truth is, when you are buying a coin, it's a pretty easy process. Especially in a bear market. If you see a project you like, or even just a project you think will go way up in price in a bull market, you can use historic prices to see it's a good buy. Take ETH for example. ETH was trading as low as $900 in the bear market. Granted, that was during the LUNA collapse which was pretty scary. Still, you had multiple months where you could buy ETH under $1500.  You could also compare ETH to historic ATH's and see it's way down. I mean, it just came off $4800 in 2021. Most people would say ETH/BTC are the bluechips of crypto. That means, they will lead any bull market. Without ETH/BTC appreciating in price, there will not be a bull market. So you can buy them without worrying they will be left behind in the next cycle, something you do need to worry about with alts. Look at DOGE/XRP for example.  Anyways, by looking at historical data you can see ETH was trading way below its 2021 high, and even below its 2018 high. That should indicate that the price is decent. You can buy with confidence knowing you are absolutely not buying the top. Sure, it could go down, but it's already been beat up pretty bad. In every major cycle, the ATH of ETH/BTC have surpassed the previous cycle's ATHs. So the potential profit for ETH if it goes from 1500-&gt;4800+ is more than 3X. Meanwhile, the most you can lose without leverage is 1X, and that's if ETH goes to zero, which is extremely unlikely.  To sum up the above, you can use historical price data to make a smart entry on ETH. But how about selling? We just mentioned that each major cycle should be defined by new and higher ATH's. So how do you sell something trading at ATH? Well, historically it's very hard to say. ETH went from $10-&gt;$1500 in 2017. If you sold at $100, you missed out massively, even though that was 10X the ATH.  Meanwhile, in 2021 we only did \~3X the previous ATH. So, how could you know the price was right? The risk of being wrong is watching a coin you believe in doing another 2X, 3X, 5X, whatever. That is the worst situation possible. There is nothing more painful than watching other people make money on a coin you believe in, while you are sitting in cash. It is PAINFUL to seriously underperform in a bull market.  So people are naturally quite scared to sell. When you break into new ATH territory, it's very hard to know when the music will stop. You don't have much historical precedent. You just need to ""feel"" the market and try to make a guess when enough is enough. Perhaps that links up to your own financial goals. Maybe you set a hard rule that you sell X% at X price. Either way, the idea that you are going to easily time the top and sell with confidence in crypto is a bit absurd. You'll rarely feel good at the time when you sell a coin you believe in. Can you watch from the sidelines as it pumps up higher? If not, you're likely to jump back in at a bad time.  Happy to hear your advice / comments on selling your investments. How do you do it?","My first buy was in January 2018, so basically at ATH. For the next 3 and half year I was dca-ing, constantly in red. Then all of a sudden, gains started piling up. It was all happening so fast, every month I would earn my yearly paycheck. That's when I had a conversation with my wife about the end goal.  We both agreed that we want to erase our mortgage. I knew what the amount had to be, so I would not try to time the market, nor I would feel bad whether the market would keep rising after I cashed out.  Once we hit the number, I started selling, not caring whether the price would go higher. I sold at 62,000 and erased our mortgage. Did I feel bad the market then went to 69,000? Not at all, we had our own roof over the head that nobody could take. I believe completing a goal of that magnitude (could be different for other people, like erasing student loans etc.) helped me a lot with not feeling any fomo or regret of selling too soon.  Of course, with hindsight, it was a great decision to sell when I sold, but back then when everyone was thinking 100,000 was happening 100%, it probably wasn't the best decision.  To sum up - Set yourself a goal you'll be proud to clear this cycle. There'll be other cycles to help you with other goals. When you hit that number, just press that market sell button and be proud you stick to your strategy. You won't feel regret or fomo that you potentially sold too soon.  And of course, nobody's saying you can't keep investing. I've of course continued to DCA over the past three years, deploying any excess capital into the market. I am now sitting on a much bigger pile of money that's ready to be sold when I hit the number I need for this cycle.",This is absolutely the way. Well done dude,"I love this in part because you did well and part because it's nice to hear someone who has a good relationship with his wife and has actual adult conversations with her about financial decisions. As a woman on this sub, I can't tell you how exhausting it is to constantly hear the ""make sure you hide everything from your wife or she'll be your ex-wife"" comments. So good on you dude.","I like to decide a strategy ahead of time and ensure I stick to it. Last cycle I decided after the run had clearly started that I was going to keep crypto at or below x% of net worth, with a weekly rebalance .  This time I am going to do something similar but my finances have significantly changed so my exact strategy is a bit different","Guys, stop believing that crypto cycles are a law of nature. There isn't an infinite supply of people and assets that can be converted to crypto, eventually the market is saturated. In addition these cycles are too great of an opportunity for arbitrage to continue as is. Once tradfi enters the game they will exploit that opportunity until it's gone. There will still be ups and downs, but they will be just as unpredictable as the stock market.  Who made the most in crypto? Those who constantly bought and sold? No, those who bought early and held the longest through the ups and downs. Of course you want to be the one selling at the top in hind sight. But there was no way for you to know. Why did the price climb to 60k? Because people bought BTC at 60k believing it would go higher. Those people aren't any smarter or dumber than those who bought at 40k. Up to that point the chart looked the same: up. Don't get confused by hind sight. Buy, hold, DCA, repeat. And once you need the money, DCA out.","I put 1 btc aside for both of my kids for when they’re 18. One is 5, one almost 9. They’re either set for life or due an interesting bit of digital history.","Yeah you did well mate, good decision all around.  Now you are here for the next run. 👍",I bought NANO in 2017 for 5$/coin and it went up 36$/coin. Now it's worth 1.1$. Don't be like me.,"Set a target selling price that you can be content with, say, 2x, then set a sell order for half of your stack there. Take another quarter, and set staggering sell orders from halfway to that target, which is 1.5x to 2X in this example. Let the other quarter runs as a lottery ticket to prevent FOMO. You can also reiterate the process with that quarter to further mitigate the risk.  You won’t make the max profit but you will have some profit you can live with without FOMO. If it all collapsed before you sold, you still have some profit taken.","Stop trying to time the top. If you manage to catch 80% of a bull market then you're already ahead of everybody else and you should sell.     We're all wired to focus on the \*peak\* of...anything. Mount Everest isn't worth it unless you climb to the top. You lost the marathon unless you came in 1st place. But this is just a psychological phenomenon that all human beings tend to experience - investment is NOT an all-or-nothing game.     Instead, try to progressively pull out %'s of your money as you see progressively higher peaks in the price. If nothing else, this becomes a rule and a habit that you'll follow (because it's MUCH easier to sell a little bit more if you already sold a little bit). If you're feeling anxious and you see more money in your portfolio than you've ever seen in your bank account...that's ok! Maybe that anxiety's telling you some of those gains should go into your bank account :)     If you catch 80% (or 60%...or 40%!) of a bull market, you're ahead of where you would be if you sat on the sidelines! Don't forget this is a long-term game and you'll only have more rounds to play if you keep your money on the table."
cryptocurrency,Feb,1aurk0u,From a Celsius fool who received 27 cents to the dollar back... Don't stake on custodial services!,"While my story thankfully is over, the haircut I took because I ""trusted"" Celsius is about 27 cents to the current dollar. A 70% recovery of the dollar amount established at the depths of BTC this run.  A costly yet valuable lesson and something I'd love to ""pay forward"".  Yes, I can imagine we all want to earn interest on our Bitcoin if nothing else to just have more (we can't have enough).   But the systems just aren't there yet. The lack of any sense of regulatory safety (dirty words, I know) means that coins are simply subject to their own TOS that can change at a whim and does nothing for you as a consumer  No matter the ""military grade"" security or insurances, it doesn't matter when shit truly goes down. An apology and a ""sorry we fucked ya"" is all you will get.  Personally, I would only ever begin to ""trust"" fully regulated organizations and even then, as a far as I can throw 'em.   True, non custodial, true risk free interest bearing assets, imo, as of this moment, are simply not possible, in terms of Bitcoin. (So no, I'm not advocating for Bitcoin ""banks"", just saying that government backed insurance to me still carry a bit more weight, I'm not a total anarchist 😉)  I've seen a few posts mentioning yield and staking on custodial services or CEX's and please, consider the risks.  Take it from someone who fucked around and found out, ultimately, for the relatively small amount of money you'll think you make, it's genuinely not worth the risk.","Sorry you had to go through this.

It will continue to happen because people are greedy and don't take well established advice.,"Yup, I'm still sore about that one.

Like something else is driving this action and I don't trust it. I knew though this was gonna happen after the ETF approval. That's why I put $3k more in. I know the halving is coming.  That being said I don't see any people talking about bitcoin amongst my peer groups or at work. I don't see anyone getting excited like they were back in 2020. Is there an overall fatigue of people with crypto and that's why? Was it done on purpose so the institutions could grab up all the BTC and leave us crying?  I don't know. Maybe I need to get more sleep. But something doesn't feel right so far about this bull run. It's like we haven't ""shed"" the depravity of the crashes of Binance and Luna too long ago.

This is criminal and should not be tolerated on the supposedly regulated exchanges.","No it shouldn’t affect the market.

It is important to note that in a supply crunch, an exchange will use your coins to handle the situation. So in that scenario yes you are preventing supply crunches by holding it with an exchange. This has happened with Dogecoin on many of the biggest exchanges. Users were locked out of trading dogecoin while exchanges used user coins to meet orders until demand settled and the supply shock ended.

If they are continuosly updating their blockchain and follow through with their roadmap, they earn my trust. If they are not, I refuse to invest in them. Why? Because they will most likely face delisting, which usually leads to the death of a coin. WaltonChain is a great example.  3. Ranking on CoinsMarketCap or CoinGecko. I have limited myself to the top 250 projects. My goal is to keep it only to the top 100. This is related to the next one.  4. Volume: Must have high trading volume. Usually if they are top 100, they have high volume. Only reason I made an exception to any coins such as ONT, which is not top 100, is because they have strong backing from Binance. This also includes NEO. If they did not, I would not invest in them.  5. Useage. Are people actually using it? I check their **explorers** to see if people are actually transacting on them. If transactions drop, it means it is dying and no one will use it. What is the point then?"
cryptocurrency,Feb,1avqlgj,A New Take on Bitcoin Halving Cycles,"One thing every crypto OG is aware of is the Bitcoin halving cycle. Typically we see charts and percentage gains calculated from the time of halving. This method anchors Bitcoin price action to dates, rather than price action. In the below chart, we look at the Bitcoin halving cycles, but calculated as of the low price of that cycle. So in the data below, each cycle actually begins BEFORE the halving date.  This method allows us to view Bitcoin's price action THROUGH the halving cycle.  &amp;#x200B;  [SOURCE:  CoinCodex \(price as of \\""close\\""\)](https://preview.redd.it/48ru9iwsosjc1.png?width=866&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=246cf691bbf96811a8c56b8cb32593a8351b13ca)  The chart below shows each halving cycle.  The x-axis represents how many days past the low.  The y-axis represents the % growth from that cycle low.  The dot marker for each line represents the halving date for that cycle.  So using our current 2024 cycle as an example: Day 0 represents November 22, 2022 when Bitcoin crashed to \~$15,780 after FTX collapsed. We are currently 455 days past that low, and Bitcoin's price today is 228% of that low.  &amp;#x200B;  [SOURCE:  CoinCodex \(daily price as of \\""close\\""\)](https://preview.redd.it/eni2hpavosjc1.png?width=1806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d69ccb0465933e190bc2b28f4600c09909da3742)  So what can we see from this chart?  1. **It takes over 1,000 days for each cycle to reach the new All-Time High (ATH)** 2. **Each new ATH has become an increasingly lower % of the low** 3. **Our current 2024 cycle is tracking well to previous cycles**  This data would suggest that we are \~500 days from our next ATH, with the ATH coming in closer to 8-10x of the low ($120-160k).  That being said, obviously this is all bullshit. It's really impossible to observe trends with only a few data points, especially considering the massive economic variables not shown in the chart (10 year bull market, near zero interest rates, Covid, spot ETFs, etc). It is tough not to be excited though when we take a step back and realize Bitcoin is sitting at $52k today, a few months before the halving, with institutional money just beginning to pour in.  **TL;DR** Bitcoin to the moon",Got it.

For the 7ths straight year, I've formed a homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Fund.  The 2024 Top Ten Experiment features **BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, BUSD, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT,** and **LTC.**  **SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 FEB Snapshot).**  **tl;dr**  * **What's this all about?** I AM LEGEND. I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for over 6 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** ***Learn more about the features in the 2024 Top Ten Experiment*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024/)***.*** * **JANUARY Highlights:** 2024 starts off all red. **ETH** (down -6%) best performing, takes early lead. In last place, **DOT** loses a quarter of its value. * The 2024 portfolio is **-14%** so far this year compared to +**11%** from the S&amp;P500. DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 7 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&amp;P 500 over the same time period (+118% vs S&amp;P500's +44% - see below for details). * Repeating last year's friendly competition between Top Ten Portfolio and total market cap token **AMKT.**  Down -5%,  [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**) is out to an early lead.  ## Month One – Down -14%  https://preview.redd.it/j8iv258x5yic1.png?width=966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3d2e4be0d69eda6dbc58dab77c1ee54d595c9db  The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL, XRP, ADA, AVAX, DOGE, DOT.**  January highlights for the 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:  * **All red month** * **ETH** slips the least (-6%)  ## January Ranking and Dropouts  Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2024 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:  https://preview.redd.it/srqjih2z5yic1.png?width=225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b43d8435545b726f22efdee52ff82eca94531b0  **January Winners and Losers**  ***January Winners*** –  None, really. **ETH** turned in the best performance of the group, falling -6% in January.  ***January Losers*** – **DOT** lost nearly a quarter of its value (-24%) this month, underperforming the rest of the Top Ten.  ## Overall Update: All cryptos in the red, slow start to 2024.  In stark contrast to [January 2023](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/), this year is off to a weak start.  Never a good sign when first place for the month is a stablecoin (**USDT**).  **ETH** is out to an early lead, down only -6% in January, followed closely by **BTC** and **BNB**, both -7% so far in 2024.  The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** thirty days ago is worth $94 today.  ## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024:  https://preview.redd.it/zyv6xwb06yic1.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2d40651580c8b5f8e73b4dcdfa57198e7c004c  The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio lost $143 in January.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$857.**   Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:  https://preview.redd.it/z1d21qi16yic1.png?width=213&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0da8ed9caecf4d6f5313c7ffb4f0d9c199f42206  ## 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT).  The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last six years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).  Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    To mirror traditional index fund products, [**AMKT** is also currently providing a 5% APR match](https://amkt.com/), essentially creating its own dividend.  Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  One month into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:   https://preview.redd.it/2wmm6w336yic1.png?width=445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9442d7e0f16232bffd2a985d14f19f05c4959264  **January Performances:**  * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -14%  * **AMKT**: -5%.  The January monthly victory goes to: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**  For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/b4b9tsx46yic1.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da13b8e1520a299a538b0ac83f08e1614c12a8e  ## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -19% (total value $812) * [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-61): up +320% (total value $4,202) * 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +426% (total value $5,257) (***best performing portfolio****)* * 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +112% (total value $2,120) * 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -59% (total value $413) (***worst performing portfolio****)* * 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +47% (total value $1,471) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): down -14% (total value $951)  Taking the seven portfolios together:  **After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$15,226.**   **That’s up +118%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:  https://preview.redd.it/bglr08866yic1.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c7c0e15ea4fa170dfa68f9cfd2f33c0c1ede077  In summary: ***That’s a +118% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.  ## Comparison to S&amp;P 500  I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  https://preview.redd.it/x6208ve76yic1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e45637581052a14089667b0214839bbb9401db  The S&amp;P 500 is up +11% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,110 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  Not a bad start to the year.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,840 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,960 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,520 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,310 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,030 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,280 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,110 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:   **After seven $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $10,050.**  That is up **+44%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+118%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/t7mbkpu86yic1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b49fbb5d0698e76532ee914abe3c5a78b5027da  ## Conclusion:  Not the best start to a year for crypto, but there’s an overwhelmingly positive outlook for the year ahead.  We’ll see what 2024 holds for the Top Ten Portfolio.     To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.   A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  January’s extended report is on the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-61).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-71), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-44), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) reports as well.","I dont understand why everybody keeps adding stables to these tests.  Theres quite literally only downside unless you stake everything which you dont appear to be counting.  In fact, a MUCH better test would to be constantly searching for the best ‘safe’ staking rewards and adding the returns to your valuation.  Hell aome coins the entire value increase is generated from staking (atom) so you have to count the airdrops received in the token price to realise true value.  Anyway, this is all subjective as hell.  But stop adding stables to this experiment….it makes zero sense in the context of what youre testing…","Upvoted. Honest question for you: ""everybody keeps adding stables to these tests"" - who else are running these Experiments?  I thought I was the only one.  Stables: fair point, and I get a lot of this during bull markets - and almost none of this in bears lol if only there was a link explaining the history/rationale behind including stables, maybe in a tl;dr section :)  Spoiler: in a moment of weakness on dark and stormy night in early 2019, I decided to stay true to the Top Ten spirit of this Experiment and include USDT. Now I keep one in every year to allow for an honest/accurate comparison between the portfolios, or at least that is the intent. I certainly didn't foresee the rise of stablecoins, I thought it was a feature of the deep bear we were in.  In retrospect and in a bull, yeah, I wish I didn't include stables.  In 2020, I tried to get fancy with my $100 in stables, that didn't go well lol","Ive seen this experiment done in a couple places on other platforms (always with stables…), but also didnt realise this was you the entire frickin time hehe.  I vaguely remember when you first started doing these posts and I thought ut was so damn clever.  Kind of make sense with all your existing data points now.  Youre not looking at a year in isolation but compared to all your prior years.  Throwing that out by removing stables now kind of invalidates the data.  Aight as you were friend!","I don't get why people are getting mad that stablecoins are on the list. It's your experiment, you can pick whatever criteria you want.  If someone wants to do something else, they're free to do so","thank you ser, carrying on!","Nice update again, tnx.","Market trolling this post, popped off one week later.","Word.  Thank you, ser.  Correct, everyone is free to do their own Experiments!",![img](avatar_exp|78116934|take_my_energy)  It’s here! Looking forward to Februarys recap  Is AMKT yours? How did you find out about it?,"Thank you, ser!"
cryptocurrency,Feb,1alpeh5,The highest paid job in crypto? Self-employed memecoin developer.,[deleted],"Professional scammer, dumper of pumps. 😂","""With the memecoin $PORK, 2 of the top traders never bought any coins, yet they sold coins for over $1 million in profit (AKA: these are the dev’s addresses and he minted his tokens at launch).""  Lol all you need to know about shitcoins","tldr; The article discusses how creating and launching a memecoin has become a highly profitable venture in the cryptocurrency space. With tools like Metadrop, individuals can easily launch their own tokens on the blockchain. Developers can profit through various means such as transaction taxes, selling minted coins, or even rug-pulling, although the latter is not recommended. In a single day, over 400 tokens were launched on Ethereum, generating over $3 million in profits for developers. The ease of token creation and the potential for high returns has led to a surge in self-employed memecoin developers.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.",But there's no fun without rug-pulling,And yet there will never no shortage of professional scammees in this space.,"I know someone who does this.

He tried to make me invest but i feel like hes gonna dump on me too lmao",“although the latter is not recommended” like no shit sherlock. Let’s write about how profitable scamming is and then act like only the rug pulling part is frowned upon.,Part of the local culture.,It’s all bullshit. There are devs selling off minted token but those shown in the images are MeV bots. Different wallets buy and all send the token to the same wallet that only sells,"Can we real talk for a second?  I'm starting to even have a hard time thinking of people who lose money on these rug pulls as having been scammed.  You got exactly what you paid for, the smart contact created x number of tokens, another user created a pool on a Dex with that new meme coin and another actually valuable coin, and you swapped your actually valuable coin for some of their shitty little shit shits.  If the user who created the pool suddenly finds themselves with a huge amount of an actually useful and valuable token then of course they are going to take it all out because it was always their money and always a worthless coin.  You bought the coin because you were being stupid and greedy and you got everything you paid for.   Not that I love the people who make these meme coins or anything but Jesus Christ people just stop buying them.  It's normal to be envious when you see headlines but just throw that smoldering resentment on the bill and don't ruin yourself chasing the dragon."

Retail is currently living paycheck to paycheck at the moment waiting for daddy Powell to start the printer up again.",They will be back but too late as always,"Yeah, you don't need to make new wallets when people buy the ETF.",The printer is the reason they are living paycheck to paycheck.  When it starts again it will only get worse for the majority of Americans. The US government cares not one bit about each and every one of us.,Many reasons for one like not having the responsibility of storing your wallet and losing keys.

Now we have triple A looking + gameplay wise crypto games in playable, but early stages (for example Off the Grid). The developers are making real games, there's even no mention that it's a crypto game. A casual gamer wouldn't even notice playing a crypto game!  2) In 2021 all banks were anti crypto, no institutional investing in crypto.

My take on the current situation is that you don't understand how a start of a bull cycle looks if these are bullish signs :) ... Most assets (eth included) are quite far from the Ath of the last bull, and if you compare the 2 cycles we had, the Ath of the 2017 was the bottom for the 2021 bear.

cryptocurrency,Mar,1b8zo82,You sold everything. remember?

My OG friend buy 3 btc at $2,000 each, only to sell them at $8,000. Can never get to that level again.  Me: Sell my condo with a $550/mortgage and $400 month positive cash flow because I had too much debt, only to see the property +90% since then (2020). Can never get that investment again.  If you are heavy into crypto, you most likely have a longer term time horizon, an idea of delayed gratification, and long term investing. HOWEVER, you are also more likely to see huge gains and wealth at a relatively young age.  I think this is a very difficult thing to deal with (first world problems). However, it is an issue.  I highly encourage you to tell no one about your crypto. NO one. Your wife will want to spend it, your boss will hate that you are wealthier than him (who knows, maybe he panic sold), your friends will envy you. It is the natural course. If you need to tell someone, tell them you have 10% of what you actually have.  I have no problems with Ferraris and rolexes-but please, for the love of God, protect yourself. Get a small house. Get solar. Get a small electric car. You have no car bill, no electric bill, no fuel bill, no house bill. You have unlocked freedom.   In fact, you can now easily invest in crashes because you don't need to be short term oriented.  Keep your W2  job. Even if you work in a crazy, dysfunctional environment.

FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS.  Keep your ego in check. This isn't just relative to crypto. The easiest way to get wealthy is to NOT WASH OUT. I know many men who during most of their life made very, very good incomes but leveraged themselves up. They had to restart their entire financial life after 2008. For those in crypto, I know someone who had to restart their financial life after 2017, then again in April 2020.  please for the love of all that is holy stay away from leveraged trading.  P.S. I know a guy who put $2,500 in to dogecoin and it was worth $750k at the top. I own Doge.

cryptocurrency,Mar,1bh6m8j,BlackRock - The Next Move After the Bitcoin ETF,"As primarily a gold and commodities guy, I've been watching the crypto space for some time with some decent exposure to BTC, and recently have built a small alt coin and meme coin portfolio with the help of my nephew. With that said, when the BlackRock BTC ETF was approved, I was shocked because this is much bigger news than the crypto community here is taking for at face value.   A long time ago I remember saying to my nephew who was involved in crypto ""it's an outright scam"". Over the years my opinion has shifted and with BlackRock arriving, I believe that things are going to become even more legitimate. BlackRock is not here to ""dabble"" in crypto or to stop at just an ETF. They are here to win and I can assure you this as the boomer in this group who has been observing with a BTC investment since 2017.   This company is not going to stop at the ETF. Larry Fink clearly has greater plans and it is important to watch the moves BlackRock makes - Fink is explicit about pushing further into the world of tokenization ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTveRlW7QPo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTveRlW7QPo)).  I have no idea what their next steps are going to be, but I’m certain that there will be something. They have already teamed up with Coinbase as their ETF custodian and Coinbase has a real legal team, which makes them the most obvious continued crypto partner for anything and everything Blackrock will want to do. BlackRock is very smart in this sense because crypto is seen as a risk, as a scam. BlackRock knows this and will use Coinbase as an ally to continue its crypto mission for this very reason.  Now here is where things get interesting. My nephew has been explaining to me how the memecoin market works. Keep in mind he trades them in and out, but I’m more interested in holding the right coins for the rest of the year. Like gold and BTC, something I could hold and not look at for some time. When I first looked at these Memecoins charts I was suspicious, but the great George Soros has taught me that it’s much smarter to be early to a bubble then to avoid it altogether, so I have kept as open of a mind as possible. He also says to rush to join the bubble, and so I think everyone is now doing just that.  This is going somewhere I promise…my nephew was over for a family BBQ today and told me he bought a coin called ""Black Rock"" on Coinbase’s Base chain, but that it’s funny to him because it’s just a Black Rock. He showed me the website and it is just a picture of a rock. But then the lightbulb in my head went off. **If we pay close attention to Blackrock’s plans, and Larry Fink’s interview, then it’s only a matter of time before a headline hits talking about how BlackRock and Coinbase are working on their next great venture together**. When that happens I think the ROCK token that my nephew shared with me has the chance to be ""the big one"" for Base chain.  When I mention that BlackRock is not here to ""dabble"" they are here to win, I mean there strategy is not starting and stopping with an ETF. **The evidence is clear that Coinbase is the best possible partner for BlackRock. The odds that a headline creates immense FOMO in a Black Rock token on Base chain seems very high to me, and in my opinion is an amazing risk/reward that has resulted in me crafting this analysis to share with all of you.** You won’t see me on here much, but hopefully this post ages very well.",Sounds dumb. I am in.,I’m not sure if this post is a joke,bro wants to hold meme coins for a year lmfao,"I ain’t reading that.  Congrats though, or sorry that happened.","OMG , I won't ever get this time added back to my life. If you have nothing to say, write a book about it",I know it’s you Larry,"You got this very wrong. Blackrock has nothing to do with Bitcoin, really. All they do is sell the possibility to get exposure to bitcoin. What is driving the bitcoin price and long-term value is the people. Always has been, always will be. It is the people that buy the coin, hold it, integrate it into society.  Blackrock is cancer that does nothing good for the world except offering people the possiblity to get exposure to real-world assets in an easy manner and getting paid for doing so. Which could be considered an important task, but you need to have a broker, bank account and credibility to get exposure to their ETFs and 25% of people on planet earth dont have this.  Tokenization is essentially rendering blockrock's business model useless, because you can seamlessly transact on a global, permissionless network/blockchain that doesnt require a middle man to get exposure to real-world assets. All blackrock does is try to reap as much money as possible before they become irrelevant. Although, they will probably find a way to stay relevant, e.g., being the ones that ""underwrite"" the tokenization, keeping custody or doing other stuff that will be required.","I stopped reading at meme coin holding.

Here's what i have.   The halving occurs every four years, cutting the reward for mining new blocks in half. The next halving will reduce rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.  Historical Price Impacts:  * 2012 Halving: Bitcoin's price surged approximately 9308% in 13 months. * 2016 Halving: Saw a 2861% increase over 17 months. * 2020 Halving: Resulted in a 620% increase in 11 months.

cryptocurrency,Mar,1bd5wie,Sold all my position and taken profit - Time to reflect,"Thousands of hours spent on DYORing, DCAing over 4 years and carefully keeping myself up to date with all the coins in my watchlist (ca. 50 all in top 200) and opportunistically swapping among some coins to try to anticipate trends. I ended up having invested an abundant double digit % of my net worth in crypto.   I went through the 2021 frenzy with diamond hands and didn’t take any profit. It was my first whole cycle and as many of us I learned the lesson in the hard way.   At the lowest, in Nov 2022, my portfolio was showing a -65%, after all the Luna (in which I was heavily invested…), Gemini, FTX drama Needless to say that red figure was showing every early morning and every late night, feeling like a stone on my belly.  I think the key was just to have a strong conviction and consistency.  At the lowest, I actually put down a large lump sum on a couple of high conviction bets (thanks god INJ, ended up doing my first 25x) and said that I would not have invested more if BTC would have gone below 15k. Luckily, I was hitting exactly the bottom of the cycle.  From that moment on I was patiently waiting and soon that red figure started to become orange, yellow, grey and finally green.  My conviction is that we will go well beyond 70k price in the next months but this time, having learned the lesson and having reached +70% of profits on a large sum, I decided to finally take profit and sell.   After a night spent with 20 cold and hot wallets, carefully moving all my 40+ positions to the exchange (ps. Always do a small test transfer before moving big sums over a chain!), I sold each of them. Today the large fiat withdraw transfer from the exchange hit my bank account and finally it was … real.  I am already suffering seeing that BTC &amp; co are rallying today but I feel I developed a strong sense of belonging into the crypto world and actually feeling happy for you guys that are holding (although a bit jealous, but I guess 100% satisfaction just cannot be achieved, emotions - and greed among them - are too strong).  One day I am sure I will make another bank transfer, towards the exchange, and the story will start again. Maybe with lower amounts.  But for the time being I’ll be on the sidelines and cheer.  Pls guys remember to take profit at some point, particularly if you are new to crypto, that is an important lesson. Play smart.  Ps. Anyone has experienced my same “take profit” bittersweet happiness &amp; sadness? :)",See you in a month,Congrats on your profits! Hope its a life changing amount of money,"I'm in the process of taking profits. Started at $50k BTC, sold 10%   I am selling an additional 10% at each $10k BTC increase.

No easy software patch for it, new chips will have to be designed around it.   Security consultancy company CEO Robert Graham recommends deleting high value crypto wallets from Apple devices.","This is the most important part of the article.  **Attack Vector**  How does an attacker trick the processor? They can do this by slipping malicious code into an application that a user downloads to their computer. The GoFetch attack code they created doesn’t require root access on a machine to work; it can trick the processor into doing this with just the same level of access that any third-party application has on a machine.  It could also be conducted on a cloud server hosting virtual machines used by multiple parties.  “If I’m on Amazon on a cloud server using a virtual machine and there’s another virtual machine using keys there, that’s another example of a case where this could be a problem,” says Green. But he cautions that it’s not an easy attack to pull off.  It’s also theoretically possible for an attacker to pull this off by embedding malicious code into Javascript on a web site so that when a computer with an M-series chip visits the site, the attacker’s malicious code can conduct the attack to grab data from the cache. The researchers didn’t test a web site attack, but Green says the scenario is plausible. It would also be a more concerning attack, he notes, because attackers could scale it to attack thousands of computers quickly.","&gt; It’s also theoretically possible for an attacker to pull this off by embedding malicious code into Javascript on a web site so that when a computer with an M-series chip visits the site, the attacker’s malicious code can conduct the attack to grab data from the cache.

The vulnerability, found during cryptographic operations, could enable the theft of keys used for crypto wallets, secure email, and cloud accounts. The flaw exploits the chips' prefetching feature, which can inadvertently place sensitive key-related material in cache memory, making it accessible through side-channel attacks. The researchers developed a malicious application, GoFetch, demonstrating the attack. Apple has been informed but the issue, being hardware-based, cannot be easily patched through software updates.

cryptocurrency,Mar,1bhsisr,Realised today that I don't like where Ethereum is going,"Background :   I only hold BTC and ETH (70%/30%).   I've been around in the crypto space for a very long time.   The following is my own opinion and this a this a friendly discussion about ETH only. I'm not looking for alternatives, I already know most of them.  Lately, I've been really considering swaping my ETH for BTC (at least for now) for the following reasons:  * Ethereum team pretty much completely gave up on scaling the main chain. they are now solely focused on improving L2s and pushing people toward using them. * I think L2 suck, and that they're not user friendly. some people might argue that bridging tokens is ""easy"", but I think you're missing other important points :   1- whenever i want to get paid in ETH from a business or someone, NO ONE EVER has a withdraw/payment with L2s. same goes with sending money to normal people.   2- This is pretty much how L2 feels to for anyone I've ever talked to : Risky / Complicated / afraid coins will be lost (multiple chains and names confusing) / afraid to use a malicious site / Fuck this, I rather just use another cheap L1 chain.    * This is how I see BTC/ETH :    \-I hold BTC because i believe it's the best store of value (like gold)   \-I hold ETH because i believe it's a cheaper way to move money, while also being safe store of value that's not gonna dump and die in the future.   The thing is now, I'm starting to believe that Ethereum lost the position as a cheap L1 chain and it's never getting it back because they don't care about cheap L1 anymore. (like how Vitalik's gas limit proposition got ignored and sharding on L1 not being a priority anymore).   Your bags aside, how can you possibly think that most people will be using L2s in the future, when you can clearly see that people are having a hard time just wrapping their head around basic crypto stuff ? I just can't see it.","Someone will make a killer app or they won't. If they do, it'll be a phone app that's a wallet, an L2 bridge and a fiat connection all in one, and it'll look like Venmo. End users can store, stake (if it's legal where they are, I suppose) and send back and forth for pennies on the L2, never knowing it's on an L2 or even what the fuck that means (since nobody actually understands that stuff anyway, even mr and mrs arbitrum). That app gets popular and suddenly other apps do it too and boom, you've got ETH for the masses.  Why nobody has done this yet is beyond me, but until they do, ETH is going to be an also-ran. If Sol or someone else does it first, that may be the way to flip Ethereum from #2 to #gone.",Loopring Wallet has pretty much done this.,"then they seriously need to work on their branding, because their website still looks like one of those ""web 3.0"" scammy nft sites. I mean what does ""Ethereum's First zkRollup Layer 2"" have to do with a 15 year old wanting to send money to a friend?  I'm being a little facetious, but the point is that I'm aware that there are wallets that work on my phone. They're nowhere near simple enough. People here will scream about backing up seed phrases and custodial crypto and they'll be kind of right, but nobody cares that BTC is now folded into the very institutions it was created to undermine because their ""bags"" (oh how I hate this trend) are getting fatter. Same will happen with this, if it ever gets made. Acorns, but for ETH. very few buttons, no dire warnings and no fucking ""zkRollups"" for the love of pete.","The ethereum devs, like the bitcoin devs, realised that scaling L1 in a even remotely sufficient manner is not possible without sacrificing decentralization and thereby trustlessness ans security. And even then, you cant scale sufficiently (see solana which took this centralized approach and is currently clogged anyways without any relevant adoption)  Contrary to bitcoin, ethereums L2s work. So if you dislike where ethereum is going you must absolutely loath bitcoin.",You are absolutely right. Crypto is a bit up its own ass with thinking what is applicable to regular humans,LRC is exactly that. Correct.,"L2 are a way to scale Ethereum.  There is no magic solution like ""just make blocks bigger"".  &gt;Your bags aside, how can you possibly think that most people will be using L2s in the future, when you can clearly see that people are having a hard time just wrapping their head around basic crypto stuff ? I just can't see it.  Because it is simpler than you make it how.  Three step process to use an L2  1) Use metamask.  2) Get some ETH and USDC from coinbase but instead of clicking ethereum for network click on Arbitrum. 3) Do whatever you want with 99.9% lower fees","remember when you had to download the entire blockchain and sync it and interact with it using the terminal? And the regular users were all ""duh, n00b, this is easy, just git gud."" and then they got rich when things got a tiny smidgen easier to use?  We're leagues away from those days now, but it's still hilariously too opaque to explain to people. forget getting them to buy in and use crypto rather than, say, Venmo.","I don’t think you understand.   BTC is a store of value. But so is ETH.   Bitcoin is analogous to digital gold.   Ethereum is analogous to the S&amp;P 500.   Investing in ETH is like investing in an index fund, where you trust that the value of the fund will increase based on the value of its many components.   Nothing has a network effect like Ethereum, thanks to being a first mover on smart contracts.   You don’t hold ETH because it’s the best way to move money. There are tons of better projects that do this cheap and fast, XLM is a great example.   Just like bitcoin, you should see it as a way to own digital “real estate,” especially now that it’s a deflationary token.",Here’s a news flash. Crypto in general is not user friendly. Doesn’t matter if we’re talking about L1s or L2s or whatever. This is the biggest issue that needs to be solved and it’s not an Ethereum specific problem. I’m confident that it will be fixed and people will be using applications without even knowing which layer is being used in the background. They might not even know that the app is powered by a blockchain. That’s how easy it needs to be. We’ll get there.

It could be a good strategy if you're a very good trader, but the common joe like me am better off by holding. Why?  First, the bullrun hasnt started yet...there will be at some point.  Second: nobody can exactly sell at a local top and rebuy at the exact local bottom  Third: at some point the market will pump back hard, if one has sold at a loss to rebuy later, you might wait too long to rebuy and 'lost' the total digit amount of coins, when you decide to reenter the market  Ofc, all of this only applies to ""good"" coins that can recover.

It has undergone several network updates, with the most recent being the “London” hard fork in August 2021. Ethereum aims to be a global platform for decentralized applications, offering a censorship-resistant, downtime-resistant, and fraud-resistant environment. It also introduced smart contracts and the ERC-20 compatibility standard for tokens. Despite challenges like high gas fees and low throughput, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the largest blockchain for NFT trading.

cryptocurrency,Mar,1bh2saw,Crypto hasn't even begun to melt faces - A Market Risk Analysis - Part 2,"FOMO and Greed is slowly creeping up again. At the same time, this recent 12% pullback is casting some doubts. In general, it seems like people can't put a finger on where we seem to be in this cycle.   Some Data I've been looking at suggests this is just the beginning. Let's put this sentiment into context by looking at different Market Risk Indicators.  **TL;DR**, we've got ways to go before we reach market risk similar to the last ATH - Part 2  The last time I posted this, people cricitized the rainbow chart (rightly so), so let's not use that one again.  **Weekly RSI (**[link](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITSTAMP%3ABTCUSD)**)**  https://preview.redd.it/xt85kme4bxoc1.png?width=2069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1426b8b9092546a47287c18f746528d9a4910894  Historically, whenever we reached the previous ATH, the RSI went on to have a one-year long period of overvaluation until setting the next ATH. We've just now broken our ATH from 2021 and the RSI is just entering overvaluation. Judging from previous cycles, this run-up looks very similar to what we saw in 2017. We've barely experienced a true bullmarket so far. This might be the beginning of one.  **Alphasquared (**[link](https://alphasquared.io/)**)**  https://preview.redd.it/5xp4ferubxoc1.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6b67f33a2c41eb99728adc726878125fba6998  Now this one is a tool I use specifically for evaluating market risk. Used it for the past year to stack bottom-level BTC and it's been unbelievably accurate. I'll start DCAing out at 80 risk and above.  The last time we broke through our previous 20k ATH in 2020, this indicator showed about 60 risk, which is where we are now. That's when the bull back then really started and sentiment on r/CryptoCurrency was similar to now. It feels eerily similar.  **Fear and Greed Index (**[link](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)**)**  https://preview.redd.it/pnt0wqc7cxoc1.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecff9facadcc4796585f8ce9662206383190910c  We all know the Fear and Greed index, so no need to explain what it is. For this one, we shouldn't evaluate the Index value itself, but rather how long it stays there. Similar to the RSI.  In November of 2020 we were close to touching the old 20k ATH, the Fear and Greed Index indicated a market risk of 88 and it hadn't been there for long. Back then Bitcoin more than tripled in value and the F&amp;G Index stayed in extreme greed territory for almost a whole year. How long have we been in extreme greed this cycle? About a month. History shows, we can keep pumping for so much longer.  **Verdict**  All of these indicators plot a clear picture of early bullrun days and we're nowhere near extreme risk valuations. So when asking yourself if you should take profits, continue to DCA or similar, keep this in mind. Historically speaking, we still have ways to go.",I can put my finger exactly at where we are: 33 days pre halving. That's enough facts for me,The answer is sell your house for meme coins,That's one metric I'll use for the next update!,"As someone who loaded up on Bitcoin at $16k, my face is already melted.",halving is like my comfort blanket right now.   post halving... that's when i'll feel fear creeping in,i can put my finger on my face and feel that it is not yet melted,The question is; should we buy MORE right now?,"Could you imagine selling, let alone 33 days pre halving. lol   &amp;#x200B;  Let's GO","Halving is priced in. It's been what? 3 cycles now of a post halving pump?

But we are definitely due for a correction. Just looking at the overall market sentiment I highly underrated IMO, one can obviously tell we're far from a real ATH even though the price ATH was just a few days ago.   Buckle up folks."

cryptocurrency,Mar,1bdd5dn,Uncharted Territory: How This Halving Cycle Differs,"I've noticed a lot of folks here comparing this cycle to previous ones, assuming it's just another 4-year price action. However, I see several key differences this time around:  1. **BTC hitting all-time highs before the halving:** This marks the first instance in Bitcoin history where the price hit an all-time high before the halving. Two main factors contribute to this: a) The solidification of narratives such as the BTC 4-year cycle and halving, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy, and b) ETF inflows into crypto, a new source of fiat infusion attracting more conservative investors. 2. **ETF inflows:** This new source of fiat infusion attracts a different breed of investor, usually conservative and investing through tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs. This leads to increased BTC dominance, reduced gains for altcoins (except for ETH), and potentially less BTC price volatility over time due to a different investing strategy. 3. **Retail investors:** Despite being retail investors ourselves, the participation during Bitcoin's all-time high lacks the same strength as before. More retail investors might join post-halving, but the rising prices beforehand could diminish returns, making everything seem expensive and risky. 4. **Stablecoins:** Often overlooked, many stablecoin providers are investing their fiat reserves in US bonds, causing concern for the Fed. It attracted Federal Reserve intervention to align the crypto market with its interest to limit capital outflow and market volatility.  In summary, the cryptocurrency market is evolving and the cycle differs significantly from the past three. While Bitcoin price is likely to keep rising, the pace and overall market behavior will likely differ than expectations. .Key implications for BTC and crypto include less volatility, a smaller increase in Bitcoin's post-halving price compared to last cycles, diminished gains from altcoins (excluding ETH with ETF approval), reduced retail investor participation, and an increased influence from governments and traditional finance on crypto and BTC price actions.","Am I correct in thinking that retail does not have money to spend in crypto this cycle?   cost of living increased drastically in the previous 2 years, credit cards are being maxed out, auto loan delinquency increasing, mortgages/rents being delayed.","thanks, chatGPT","Yes, inflation is high globally. Surprisingly, casinos recorded strong profits last year, even amid the heightened inflation. People tend to take riskier bets with their money when they are desperate. Consider 2020 when COVID was at its peak, and everything was shut down – yet crypto started pumping hard right after the halving","Retail buyers and “expensive” coins: I feel like casual participants mostly don’t think about market cap. Therefore, their understanding of value is more based on price per coin.  As in, a $1 coin will get more retail interest than a $100 coin, because the $1 dollar coin is comparably cheaper (even if it is actually more expensive).  I believe this is one of the reasons some dog and frog coins that are a fraction of a penny do so well in alt season, even if the dog coin has 880 gazillion coins in circulation.

Sure, Bitcoin has made headlines and drawn attention, but let's not forget that most people haven't even dipped their toes into it yet. There's still a whole world of potential waiting to be tapped. Just imagine all the companies fomoing into the ETF right when the next rip up will happen.  So, as we gear up for this next halving, let's remember: this is just the beginning.

After an all red [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2), the Top Ten Portfolio and all of crypto bounced nicely in February.  While each crypto in the group was below break even, all of them are now in the green except **XRP** by a few cents.  **DOGE** is out to an early lead, up +53% already in 2024.  **ETH** is the next best performing (+45%) followed by **BTC** (+38%).  The initial $100 invested in first place **DOGE** two months ago is worth $153 today.  ## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024:  https://preview.redd.it/ynrxu25mf4nc1.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcf5cf3a624e57ae99e2475b44d216a3e3814e85  The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio gained $350 in February.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$1,207.**   Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:  https://preview.redd.it/8wkxilinf4nc1.png?width=214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39050661434c97e647623757a5b90f142df91201  ## 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)  The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last six years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).  Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    To mirror traditional index fund products, [**AMKT** is also currently providing a 5% APR match](https://amkt.com/match), essentially creating its own dividend.  Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Two months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:   https://preview.redd.it/t4olev0pf4nc1.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a6cadf4150a4dc8f7628183f4a53b890fac2a9e  **February Performances:**  * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: +41%  * **AMKT**: +54%.  The February monthly victory goes to: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**  **Overall since January 1st, 2024:**   * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** \+21% *  **AMKT:** \+47%  Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**  For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/tgcwwzdqf4nc1.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cf34fd2cc3ec17a4c618a7f8c04b72001c9a1c8  ## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +21% (total value $1,210) * 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +510% (total value $6,098) * [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50) up +658% (total value $7,579) (***best performing portfolio****)* * 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +200% (total value $2,997) * 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -41% (total value $588) (***worst performing portfolio****)* * 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +111% (total value $2,111) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): down +21% (total value $1,207)  Taking the seven portfolios together:  **After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$21,790.**   **That’s up +211%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:  https://preview.redd.it/gr43cdjsf4nc1.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71ca99146e1206d8756c274a1fcd7e819f9645f6  In summary: ***That’s a +211% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.  ## Comparison to S&amp;P 500  I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  https://preview.redd.it/deqt6w1uf4nc1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a16d33d984e5510bbaba9eec0e00f3ffcd58ba58  The S&amp;P 500 is up +8% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,080 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  Not a bad start to the year.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,920 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,050 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,590 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,370 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,080 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,340 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,080 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:   **After seven $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $10,430.**  That is up **+49%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+211%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/p622h4dvf4nc1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f61b3fa2d223367e14bc9a00758f99367f613b1  ## Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.    A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  February’s extended report is on the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-44).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-71), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-61), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) reports as well.","Ah yes, the top 10 crypto index experiment posts.

And, for EVM compatible chains, USDT and USDC had a simple entrance path for those. I guess both companies weren't smart enough to develop Plutus contracts. Now, they have been tricked by USDM.",Excited to see where this goes,"Finally, my five cardano will make me a millionaire.","Some people in this subreddit are spreading hate about how long it took Cardano to launch its first centralized stablecoin, not about the stablecoin itself.",So many people in here care so much about a currency they don’t have. It’s fucking weird.,"@Cointestmod the inaccuracy of the ""Cardano Con Argument"" section on adoption is laughable:  ""*Cardano only has roughly [30 dApps] even a year after the release of smart contracts, and they cumulatively have around $50 million in TVL, making Cardano's market cap to TVL ratio one of the worst among DeFi protocols*.""  30 dApps and $50 million in TVL? Really? 2022 called and they want their stats back.  The actual numbers: 155+ launched dApps, with more than 1,300 in development. TVL had exceeded $420.8 million last I checked, which is substantially under reported due to Cardano's non-custodial liquid staking - factoring in ""non-hostage"" staking, the true TVL of Cardano (at current price) is in excess of $7 billion.",&gt; both companies weren't smart enough to develop Plutus contracts  It's my understanding that it was a legal compliance issue re: USDC and USDT not wanting to issue tokens on a chain where you can't create a blacklist of wallets not allowed to move USDC/USDT/whatever.,"Yes, but there is a reason. It's an obnoxious reason if you don't like Ada for one reason or another, but bear with me here - cardano is too idealistic ,literally. Cardano alts are treated equally with the Ada token, they're called native assets. And because it was built to resist rug pulls, you can't freeze native assets remotely on cardano. This on the other hand means that circle can't comply with the law because they have to freeze your money if the US tells them to. Now, if you actually worked on the problem, I'm sure some smart contract shenanigans would fix the issue, but still. For better or worse, cardano does not let up on ideals. Security is number one."
cryptocurrency,Mar,1bjv3sr,"""I need more capital for this market"" and how this thought is wrecking you. ","This is my 4th bull run and it took me a few tries to realize what went on in my head to come away from each bull market without the the moon I dreamed of.   For me, it's this feeling that I wish I had more capital in the market. You feel it too right?   Markets dipped this week, did anyone else think ""damn I wish I had more to put in""?   This feeling doesn't go away unfortunately.   Here is what happens mentally for me and likely lots of you:  ""Take profits? No way, I need every dollar in this market!""   ""ATH hit and market dips, should I sell? No way, I need every dollar in this market.""   No one knows what the top is in this market but I assure you with this mentality you will feel it could go higher every time until you are holding -80% alts and shilling for them in hopes of exit liquidity.   Anyone else feel this way?","Just remember one of these days, the dip will just keep dipping, and dipping and dipping. Noone will announce to you that the bear market has come.

Damn something is not right then,"I think most people do share this sentiment. ""Oh it is red, I need to put more money in from my savings accounts THIS IS THE MOMENT"". It is part of the FOMO that this market causes because of its volatility.  I changed my ""taking profits"" definition. Any profit I gain is part of my ""play money"" and every part of it that moves to BTC is deemed to be ""burned"". I cannot touch that play money again and BTC is my savings account. The coin, at this point, it stable enough to provide in that role. If I ever do need to move it to fiat it will come from this pool.  When the market is going up significantly, some will move to the BTC pool the rest will be redistributed to other projects or new project or just increasing my stake in a project I believe in.   This strategy moved me all the way up to 1 BTC right now and a lot of positions that are not the marginal 30 dollars in hope of a moonshot. I don't believe in moonshots, if I even do get one I will praise it to be like winning a lottery.  Going after stable returns 30% of per month on a coin is worth so much more than timing pump and dump scheme's or joining the Solana gold rush going on at this moment. This is the way of really earning money through crypto. Making 30% on your investment per month is an absurd amount. People just got greedy and only wanted 1000x.   It might take me a bit longer than the moonshot boys. But it will be at a much lower risk of losing it all.","Are you saying that if you were around then you would have held it since 17 USD?

I don’t blame her for her telling me not to do this as she said that the $500 what ever she made she was going to split it with me, I blame myself for not taking my own risk.  Wanting to know what bags or things you guys have been talked out from buying or selling way too early.",Sold €2k Shiba when it was new and worthless. 2021 hits and my wallet says it would have been worth $9 million. Fuck.,"Every single sell and buy I do is a mistake. If I buy prices go down if I sell prices go up, it's uncanny","Oh boy, do I have a story.   In late November 2017, right before the peak of the 2017-2018 bull run, over the span of a couple weeks I put my entire savings account (around $45k) into cryptocurrency. I made every mistake in the book. Way too many trades, got married to coins that had already pumped, ""almost"" made so many right choices where I would've made it... before second guessing myself and selling something before I went to bed, only to wake up the following morning to find that it mooned. A familiar story for many newbies, no doubt.  At the end of December 2017 - perhaps the greatest opportunity in crypto history - I somehow managed to fuck up that month so monumentally that I remember opening a post one day on my coin of choice's subreddit, which pointed out that it was the *only* coin in the top 100 which somehow didn't end up in the green over the month of December. Keep in mind this is a month where there were multiple coins that literally went 100x in the span of December alone.  Despite that, I did see some temporary gains at first just purely because of how well BTC was doing. I watched as it almost doubled at first, but then... the crash hit. I had to endure an entire year of drops that seemingly never ended. Every time it was looking like the market would turn around and people were getting excited about the market ""finally breaking out of the downtrend"", it just dropped even harder, crushing everyone's hopes and dreams.  I'd taken almost no financial risks in my life so in hindsight it's kind of surprising I did this, but something about crypto gripped me differently. It feels strange to type this out, but I actually took out *two loans*, $20,000 each time, which I used to buy more on the way down throughout 2018, but it all kept dropping.  Eventually my portfolio's value was around 5% of the entire money I'd put into it, including loan money. In December 2018, right as the market was bottoming out, I basically capitulated and said ""I'm already down this much, may as well take some risks"" and ended up trading everything I had to BTC before I lost *everything* in a series of margin trades with leverage. In the end I lost it all, held zero crypto, had very little money left in the bank and had committed to spending the next 2.5 years making loan repayments that I had nothing to show for.  I spent almost 2 years paying off these loans, and the repayments were roughly equal to renting a small apartment. The worst part? The crypto that I took out those loans to buy ended up going 100x from the bottom and is still more than 100x up even today, and I fully intended to buy more of it while it was down, but I couldn't buy anywhere near as much as I liked because I was *still making loan repayments*.  If I'd never taken out those loans and instead just DCA'd at regular intervals while the market was down, which I fully intended to do, I'd be a multi-millionaire now.  How's that for a horror story?",Buying weed around 2012 with Bitcoins 😢,Please keep us informed of your future transactions.

cryptocurrency,Mar,1bbdli5,I suspect Ripple is paying to be mentioned in all crypto news articles ,"Lately almost every crypto article on sites like Forbes CNBC has misleading headlines that claim XRP is also part of the price surges happening with BTC and ETH. Looking at the price history for XRP proves this isn't the case it's basically been crab walking at it's ATL for years and is down 1% YTD.   Seems very shady and illegal, they're misinforming many people that won't even fact check and then recite information, example my coworker asked if I own XRP and asked how much money I made and was at a shock when I told him I'm down because he read that the price surged and urged me to check its value again!  I'm hesitant to hold what I have but I'm already at a loss so might as well see what happens and dump if it gets close to ATH. What is everyone position on XRP? It seems to me that it's reputation is tarnished in the crypto world, what are the chances for actual use/adoption?  I'm also kind of hesitant to see alt coins gain as much momentum as they did in the last bull run, some are rising but not at the same rate as everyone expected, lots of resistance.","They keep pushing the name of XRP in every article without a break.

About 30 seconds later guy calls, and explains I'm involved in a data breach. He says my account was compromised and that I needed to transfer funds to my wallet. I'm so f\*\*cking stupid I fell for it. It took almost a half hour to go through the process, and I was dumb enough to go through the entire transaction before getting suspicious. The got the ETH, nothing else. It wasn't that much, about $300 and change, but that isn't the point. Thank God I didn't have anymore in there, and luckily when they started having me go through the rest of the assets I started to get wise. And of course that's when the call was disconnected. I can say it's losing the money that upsets me, but that isn't it. It's my stupidity and lack of paying attention. I'm 66. I'm old. Probably too old to be messing with this stuff. I'm lucky I haven't been messing with my crypto for quite a while so the funds are just minimal to keep the account active and open. I'm sick to my stomach that I was duped. Just had to share and get this off my chest. It's been years since I've been ripped off for anything, like 20 or more.

cryptocurrency,Apr,1btylbb,"Tether Buys 8,888 Bitcoin For $618 Million, But Why Is Price Down?",,"The sharp move to the downside was due to the “large liquidations on retail-heavy exchanges like Binance, which saw perp funding rates go from as high as 77% to flat.”  This indicates that retail traders were using leverage to bet on Bitcoin's price rising, and when the price dipped, they were forced to liquidate their positions due to margin calls. This selling pressure pushed the price down further, leading to a cascade of liquidations and a drop in price.  Additionally, institutional investors may have been spooked by the drop in price, leading them to delay or cancel their own purchases of Bitcoin. This lack of buying pressure from institutional investors allowed the downward momentum to continue, resulting in a sharp correction in price.","tldr; Tether, the world's largest stablecoin issuer, recently purchased 8,888 Bitcoin for $618 million, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders. Despite expectations that such a significant acquisition would boost Bitcoin's price, the price of Bitcoin actually dropped below $70,000 following the purchase. Factors contributing to the price dip include large liquidations on exchanges like Binance, significant outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs like Grayscale's GBTC, and bearish sentiment in the derivatives market. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,500, marking a decline of over 4% in the last 24 hours.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

I've been through two bull markets seeing BTC rise to a new ATH between $65k~$70k, fall swiftly downwards to the $30k~$40k regions. This time around I've been keeping a close eye on the Fear and Greed Index, and Fear has been starting to creep into the market recently, even with BTC reaching an ATH. I converted 30% of my assets into stable coins a few days ago to make sure I keep some of those profits I've gained this time, and I decided I will hold onto these stable coins until the Fear Greed Index falls to about 25, no matter what.   Too many times I've seen my profits wiped out, and I'm not going to let it happen again. I assume many instructions new to crypto have seen this happen in the past and are cautious as well. They have to be really. It's their job if they're investing on behalf of their company.

Most cheat devs have moved to crypto transactions because cheaters would flood them with credit card charge backs when their accounts inevitably got banned. Due to the ban wave structure (several thousands of bans at the same time every X-amount of months) the charge backs would overwhelm the devs financially. The switch to crypto protects the devs financially but also ensures that all of their customers have crypto access.

Once you sign the contract, your assets now belong to the scammer.  # How to Avoid Malicious NFT Airdrops  Unfortunately, it's very hard to avoid someone sending you unsolicited NFTs. However, there are actions you can take to avoid engaging with any of these malicious NFTs.  1. DO NOT ENGAGE WITH ANY AIRDROPPED NFT 2. NEVER EVER ENTER YOUR SEED PHRASE ANYWHERE 3. To avoid seeing the NFTs in your wallet, right click on the NFT and select Hide NFT Collection 4.

However, I don't like that you mentioned, but later ignored root problem - signing malicious contract. You focused on seed and nft, but that's just bait, not root problem.

Perhaps a lot of people would have been able to avoid scams if their Ledger screen or Metamask would say something like ""you are giving full access to your funds to this 3rd party app, would you like to continue, it could be a scam?""

Many seem to think that the halving date is some sort of magical date where prices shoot up.  The last halving, in may 2020, prices did not rocket to new ATH’s on that date.

I know we already had a new BTC ATH this year before the halving. That’s a new situation that we haven’t seen before.   I don’t have a crystal ball, but all I can say is this:  - The BTC halving itself isn’t cause for a price explosion short term.  - This time it will not be different (look at all the signs and the downward price).  - The halving has merely been a catalyst event for the next year/year and a half.

cryptocurrency,Apr,1c1ago2,Get up to date for Monero's 10 year anniversary on April 18th! A lot of stuff currently going on at the moment...,"#An end and a new beginning Monero is special. It risked being delisted from all major CEX, because it simply does not want to compromise on what the community holds up like no other.   **Your privacy as your human right.**  It's therefore a special birthday party as Monero is almost out from all big centralized exchanges. And it's likely that until end of this year Monero will simply be gone and eradicated from centralized entities.  It's the competition of what Satoshi intended in the first sentence in his whitepaper:  &gt; A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another **without going through a financial institution.**   Monero is delivering where BTC failed. It's the spiritual successor of BTC (which I don't want to hate on as it has found its place as a potential reserve asset for the established financial world).  # So how is a project really faring that has no access to liquidity on CEX? The answer might come as a surprise to many. But it's flourishing.  * Monero has the network with the most reachable nodes even before BTC (22k vs 18k). * After BTC and ETH it has the third most vibrant developer community. * It's at the center of the freedom/privacy tech movement. DEX and atomic swaps, P2P markets are all built around Monero. * Whenever you see any merchant or gift card provider publish any data it ranks #1 or #2 * Successfully took over the darknet markets from Bitcoin where privacy is your only security guarantee  # But what about attacks? * Price suppression might come to a halt soon with CEX volume decreasing massively both through delistings and shift from CEXto smaller insant swap exchanges or DEX/P2P markets. * Network attacks are a common thing (nodes that feed wrong data, or fee attacks), but so far the network just reliably does its job. It runs (little wink to Solana, which ""suggested"" marketcap is x40 Monero). * Attacks on people (downvote bots/upvote bots trying to discredit users of the Monero community) * Media reputation shaming naming it as a coin for criminals   #What happened in the last days?  * Kraken partial delsiting in Ireland, Belgium (and The Netherlands?)  * Long awaited ""Haveno"" fiat &lt;&gt; Monero DEX now on mainnet  * FCMP (full chain membership proofs) coming and by that getting rid of Monero's main weak spot that has been rightfully criticized by a lot of experts.  * Monerorun - Monero's proof of reserve day on 18th of April (birthday)  #Taking part in Monerorun - a public audit of (fractional or not?) reserves of CEX  Monerorun has been an essential part in the Monero community for a couple of years that post FTX debacle influenced the wider crypto ecosystem often referenced as NYKNYC - not your key, not your coins.  Now that Monero delisted almost all CEX, that begs the question of how to proceed with this event.  * Binance still has withdrawals open until May 20th. Tell all your friends to withdraw now. * Kucoin and Gate.io are lately behaving like scams. Get your Monero out if you still can. * HTX and Poloniex are two of Justin Suns projects to manipulae markets, with wash tarding, decoupled prices and fractional reseres. After almost 5 month of closed withdrawals tehy currently opened their gates. Use this opportunity to get your coins from there. * Kraken announced the auto-conversion of XMR into BTC on June 10th.

Back then I already found that naive the assertive vibe lightning would scale Bitcoin.  7 years have passed. Nobody cares about lightning relative to overall volumes. Bitcoin is in vaults. You want cheap transactions you buy some bags of literally any in the top 50 chain tokens and that's it. Those alts may come and go. They may always come and go and that works just fine. Bitcoin one day may go too. And that's fine.  There is a parallel to make with trad currencies. They also have come and gone. Some turned out much stronger than others. Eventually all currency gets replaced. And so what. The only thing that's changed is we may see more than one or two currencies in a lifetime.  I grew up using Francs. They were cool, some coins were made of real silver, eventually all replaced with alloy made chips. Then eventually it was all replaced by Euros. People did freak out, and it took time to get used to the new denomination. And it was a pain for everyone to exchange their old notes, the bank did it but in fact most were trading them with peers and local merchants.   All of these things are just vehicles as we need some common medium of exchange to trade. Who cares about it being lightning, bch, some hyped L2 roll-up.

cryptocurrency,Apr,1by391i,"DOGE trading 10 years ago, when we didn't have exchanges yet.","Just thought you guys might like some OG content.   More than 10 years ago DOGE got popular as the first meme coin. But there were no exchanges yet, or at least no alt-coin exchanges that would simply feature a lot of coins. At that time, you were able to mine a million DOGE coins per day with a simple GPU rig. As the coin got popular, trading started to happen on the forums of the coin's website - see screenshot.  &amp;#x200B;  [Doge Forums more than 10 years ago](https://preview.redd.it/gtmpwedvv1tc1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0ea32c77e9d963308c32da8ed0c803c3d7f4fa3)  Doge was actually the start of a meme coin season back in 2013. If you think about it, not much has changed :) . I did a few trade via the forums and it was an experience to say the least. You would get into contact with a random other person and you trade in increments, to make sure no one got scammed. Of course, people would even scam you for small increments. How we dealt with that was to give people on the forum a 'trust-rating'. So people with a good trust rating could (kind of) be trusted.  However, it was clear that with popularity increasing more trading options were needed. So people started to offer themselves as escrows. This worked fine, but again it was clear that this was all quite the hassle. And that was basically when the first 'meme-coin' exchange was born. Someone programmed an exchanged called 'CoinedUp' where you could trade DOGE. It was very ugly, and looked like the design was done in MSPaint. But it worked! Shortly after, other meme coins came out and were added to CoinedUp. Mind you, these exchanged were buggy as well. Nowadays you cannot imagine that if you quickly want to sell something, you just dump it on the 'market'. Back then, that didn't work and people learned the hard way. If you would sell something for 0, it would actually fill a bid from someone that was buying for literally 0.  It was fun. Shorty after that other exchanges started to pop up, quickly becoming more 'professional'.   For people that joined crypto later and wonder why DOGE has 'value' , well, this is it. It was the first ever meme coin with important history.   &amp;#x200B;",I remember holding my DOGE in a wallet on my computer and the program had to download the entire blockchain to see transactions. That was annoying.,Bought 2.5 million doge back then for ~$200 and sold it a few weeks later for ~$600...felt like a genius for years while it did nothing but now I know I'm an idiot,Why?

I bought my first bitcoins in March 2013 from exchanges that had already been around for a year or more. There were altcoins on those exchanges, Peercoin, Namecoin, Litecoin - but they weren’t “tokens” they were native coins on their own networks.  When doge came along it was traceable on exchanges pretty quick but had very little value because it was not intended to have value.

This is true even though all of this happens automatically and in a decentralized way, unlike traditional companies.   So what is the point of this perspective?   Well, we can analyze the cashflow as one would with any other company and learn things that might not be so intuitive otherwise. For example, simply measuring the revenue gives us a good look at the demand and growth for the blockchain.   Or what about financial sustainability, is the revenue enough to cover the expenses indefinitely? If not, we know that something needs to change, for example that the security budget (mining/staking rewards) has to decrease, or that revenue needs to be raised in other ways, typically by issuing new coins and inflating the supply, the same way a company would issue new stock to raise money.","If there is one thing alt L1 speculators and bitcoin maxis can agree on, it is that they all want ETH to fail despite all the evidence to the contrary.",Anyone looking at the ETHBTC chart.,"ETH is one of the most FUDed coins of all time, since 2017 ive heard the same arguments at $120 and still today at $3400",You know those fees you pay to transact on chain?

cryptocurrency,Apr,1c4lo34,"Crypto taxes (in the US) are a big, fear-inducing barrier to broader adoption","Been doing my own taxes since we still did 'em with paper and pencil. Used TurboTax for a decade+ now. This year my crypto taxes were worse than last. I was careful to limit my transactions all year. After cleaning up transactions directly on Coinbase (because the ""integration"" still fails miserably - just straight up doesn't work), I got the CSV, imported, and was immediately prompted that I needed to review \~150 items. F  Spent a few hours over several days cursing and going through them and doing what I could. The funny thing is that even within the CEX itself, which is a massive publicly traded company mind you, the calcuations are still completely fucked. Coinbase will ""sell"" my asset  a few days later according to the CSV, or sell it in chunks rather than all at once, or have dust sales, all of which end up with goofy things like $0 cost basis. Even the raw data doesn't make sense in a number of places.  Don't get me started on DeFi, that's basically impossible. Places like CoinTracker will charge you based on usage if you have a large number of transactions. If you have a well diversified portfolio where you regularly perform swaps, you can just forget it. You will be asked to pay thousands just for a tax aggregator.  I did the best I could. IRS has \~100 pages of transactions they can sort through if they want. Decided to upgrade to MAX protection for the first time ever just because I don't want to hear about it. I'm not a CPA, but at this point I might as well be.  The problem is that crypto is built to be different than our current worldwide financial system from the ground up, so the tax laws just don't fit from the ground up.  We're still early fam. Way, way early. John Smith is NOT ready for this.","#The only fear is the fear of the IRS that you start using Monero for your trades.  If you have fear. You are doing it wrong,","I'm glad this post is about doing taxes and not just paying tax. Because you're right.  I bought some tokens on Coinbase, sent it to a wallet, and then later sent it back to Coinbase to sell. Had to manually insert every purchase price one by one to get the right tax burden to show up (otherwise was saying 100% was profit when in reality I was realizing a massive loss). The irony was Coinbase had my purchase history with that very same token, but it didn't even pull it up to prompt me if they were the same or not.  One exchange, both buy and sell orders, and no way to connect the two at all purely because I moved them off the exchange. I get the hesitancy, but also, come on.  I trust that companies will get better, but everyone will do well to create a log of every purchase they made, the token, the price at the time of purchase, the total purchase price, etc. Then also be set on what your accounting system will be like (first in first out, highest in first out, etc.) and go from there. Unless you are keeping tokens 100% on an exchange, it will get messy. Even there, it will be messy.","After talking to my tax guy I'm not even worried.

cryptocurrency,Apr,1c5yw0y,South Korean Won Surpasses US Dollar in Crypto Trading Volume for Q1 2024,,$456 billion in transactions. Did not know S Korea was so huge.,Koreans esp young generations are deeply into alt coins because life is tough and everyone wants to get rich quick,I bet they're getting liquidated left and right,"Hello Reddit.  5 hours after this was posted, I will now tell you the main reason for this:  It's difficult to get coins off the Korean exchanges nowadays, onto the blockchains.  They need you to 'register' receiving wallets (that you withdraw from the exchange to) and deposit wallets (that you send to the exchange from).  The exchange site needs to 'connect' to the blockchain wallet, and it's not going to accept anything mildly out of the ordinary.  It's not going to connect with SolFlare, it'll only do Phantom wallet.  You can't use it with Brave, only Chrome.  You can't do it in a VM.  Turn your adblocker off.  Don't use a VPN or they won't let you interact with the blockchain until you send them many months of financial records.  There are of course monetary limits on how much you can deposit and withdraw too.  So most people nowadays don't bother, and just keep it on Upbit or wherever.  Those CEXs are focused on KRW pairs.  So Koreans are trading with KRW mainly.","Makes sense, considering they have a healthy gambling problem","Considering the long work hours Korean have and long school hours Korean students have, it is definitely more difficult than say US or 1st World European countries.  Source: am korean",Damn. They more degen than Americans? Wow,"tldr; The South Korean Won has surpassed the US Dollar in cryptocurrency trading volume in Q1 2024, reaching $456 billion. This surge is attributed to intense competition among South Korean crypto exchanges and strategic fee reductions. Despite financial challenges, such as a 60% profit drop for Bithumb due to zero-fee policies, the competitive strategies have significantly boosted market activity, making the Won the top fiat currency in global crypto trading.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Every Top Ten crypto but one is in positive territory so far this year: **XRP** is the exception, down -4% so far in 2024.  **DOGE,** up +124% already in 2024, has taken a commanding lead.  **BNB** is the next best performing (+86%) followed by **SOL** (+77%).  The initial $100 invested in first place **DOGE** three months ago is worth $224 today.  ## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2024  https://preview.redd.it/ru898dfjdgvc1.png?width=333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13447939383fc8819de3f2761cc27d00aa691472  The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio gained $213 in March.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2024 is now worth **$1,420.**   Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:  https://preview.redd.it/6hyatkwkdgvc1.png?width=169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1267fe0fa19fb61ffd8214a9955dbc6ff5bea6bf  ## 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)   The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last six years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).  Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    To mirror traditional index fund products, [**AMKT** is also currently providing a 5% APR match](https://amkt.com/match), essentially creating its own dividend.    Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Three months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:   https://preview.redd.it/krvg2e5mdgvc1.png?width=354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f291506d677cb77f96704627e6c3111508af1d9b  **March Performances:**  * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: +18%  * **AMKT**: +8%.  The March monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**  **Overall since January 1st, 2024:**   * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** \+42% *  **AMKT:** \+58%  Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**  For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/2ihwbd3odgvc1.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=006fdb0775c08f85057a97924d3da61ea77e6993  ## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +28% (total value $1,282) * 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +549% (total value $6,492) * 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +822% (total value $9,222) (***best performing portfolio****)* * [2021 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39) up +250% (total value $3,500) * 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -32% (total value $678) (***worst performing portfolio****)* * 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +129% (total value $2,293) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): down +42% (total value $1,420)  Taking the seven portfolios together:  **After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$24,887.**   **That’s up +256%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:  https://preview.redd.it/2posp1gpdgvc1.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f8773415338b80284865282df853694b8d6c275  In summary: ***That's a +256% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.  ## Comparison to S&amp;P 500  I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  The S&amp;P 500 is up +10% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,100 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  Not a bad start to the year.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,960 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,090 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,620 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,400 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,100 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,370 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,100 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:   https://preview.redd.it/jsvlxumrdgvc1.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a6006c810672fcbb0ce66781a594f6861b108b1  **After seven $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $10,640.**  That is up **+52%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+256%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/ic3b16wsdgvc1.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2542c9cd6eeaa15fe6fb6d0bdb391e3ad1c87fa  ## Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.   A reporting note: I'll focus on 2024 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports from me per month.  March’s extended report is on the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39).  You can check out the latest [2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-71), [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-61), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50), [2022 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12), and [2023 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12) reports as well.","Always love reading how this experimental portfolio is doing, provides an excellent historical overview, with usable data.

Two years ago I gave him some funds for investing, while I took the same amount to play with in crypto, he knew it was a challenge.  Today I’m so far ahead we don’t talk about it anymore, he always asks about the crypto though.   January he converted some funds to BTC-ETF, ARKB, of course it’s doing best in that small portfolio.

cryptocurrency,Apr,1c73psb,I believe in decentralized messaging. Don’t you?,"There is no doubt that privacy and security have become paramount. Yet, most of us rely on centralized platforms like Telegram/WhatsApp for daily communications. While convenient, these platforms pose significant risks regarding data privacy and censorship. Centralized entities can potentially monitor conversations, share data with third parties, or even block access, all of which threaten user autonomy.  I realized that decentralized messaging platforms built on blockchain technology offer a compelling alternative. Googling “blockchain messenger” I found a solution that caught my attention: ADAMANT Messenger. It operates entirely on blockchain, ensuring that no single entity controls the network. This design inherently protects against censorship and enhances privacy. For those interested in exploring this alternative, you can download apps at https://adamant(dot)im/#adm-apps.  &amp;#x200B;  What are your thoughts on the future of messaging? Does blockchain technology offer the security and privacy enough to make you switch from your current messaging apps?     https://preview.redd.it/syjjals8s8vc1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56ab58652c6dfe61808e40d485d8798c76f84eed","#Simplex and Session  Those are the gold standard, when it comes to private messaging.",I believe the blockchain should be used to store things that need to be permanently accessible.   Do those messages need to be stored by 1000 nodes centuries from now?  Yes: Put them on the blockchain  No: Keep them off the blockchain,"Blockchain is a distributed ledger.  Messages don't need a ledger, just a sender and a recipient.  Peer-to-peer networks and end-to-end encryption have existed for decades now.",Private message is a definite nogo! Even the best encryption today will break at some point in the future. Having these encrypted messages on 1000 of machines is just a stupid idea.  Public communication is a totally different topic though.,"You have no fucking idea how impossible is to maintain such thing, if 1% of WhatsApp user base starts to use some blockchain message app, it would have hours off delay for each message.  Discord had more than 1 trillion messages last year. Descentralizes databases can’t handle this. And should they? Like would I care about the a good morning sent to my mom remains forever immutable in a blockchain? Did you know the computational (and of course electrical) cost of maintaining something in a blockchain?  There is 0% chance that a blockchain message app became popular.","Signal is better than any alternatives at this point. In terms of blockchain, the scary thing is the “collect now, decrypt later” with quantum computing advancements breaking existing cryptography. Even if a chain adopts a quantum proof algorithm (and it delivers), everything before the point of the switch can still be compromised.","Agreed. I think the best use is for a digital cert on real world assets, or digital I guess. Like having a deed on the blockchain would be dope or having a certificate for a collectible.",I feel like OPs two benefits are at odds with each other here. Protecting against censorship generally means making things more publicly accessible and less private,"Yes: wiki, world news, press releases, official statements to the public, scientific research  No: Personal and/or private communication, social media, advertisements of any kind","A messaging service where every single communication is stored forever in un-deletable, un-alterable form, and can be accessed from any device in the world using a simple security key, is such an absurdly bad product I feel like it was created by an authoritarian government just to see if it will catch on."

He suggests that crypto regulation should be more tailored to the industry, similar to other sectors, and hints that the crypto community's vote could be influential in the election.

cryptocurrency,May,1chpuk2,"People who have been in crypto for more than one cycle, probably saw this drop coming from a mile away. It was textbook crypto volatility.

We always see these big dips, even during a bullrun. And after steep volatile rallies, you get equally volatile corrections.

Even in a best case scenario, you're looking at at least a 20% correction, and testing something a little below $60K at around $58K. If you believe the market is too bullish to drop that much lower.   In a market this volatile, not many large traders are gonna settle for just 16%. They may not even settle for 20%.   They want to start accumulating at the volatility level they are betting on in this market.   If you're a big player, would you just start accumulating at a low percentage, or take advantage of any news in the market, even if it's old news that's not even that negative like the CZ sentencing, to dump on the market when there's a tiny inkling of doubt, and wait to accumulate at a better volatility level?  &amp;#x200B;  # Worried about this dip?

cryptocurrency,May,1d4aeyy,My 2021 Crypto Story ,"(33f) In 2021 I made 250k off of dogecoin, as well as some on shib, gme and amc. I put in $6k.  Right when they hit highs, I experienced a high of my own. I experienced my first ever, serious manic episode. It lasted for 6 months.   I had never experienced a manic episode before and it was essentially like being blacked out while simultaneously thinking I was invincible… among other things. Nobody around me knew what was happening and neither did I. I was absolutely insane. Posting on social media, gaining over 20k simply bc of the crazy shit I was doing.   Where did that money go you ask?  You’d think I would have gotten some nice things. Jewelry, bags, clothes, shoes. Nope.   $5,000 on art supplies and toys to donate to kid’s schools (they never got donated). Toys were also left on the stoops of apartments in Brooklyn bc I thought I was Santa clause. I handed out Barbies  to little girls on the street.   $12,000 up front for 6 months of rent   $3,000 - I bought every single food item, bottled drink, Starbucks cups, bags etc in my neighborhood Starbucks. I also left this stuff on the stoops of multiple apartments.   $3,000 for 11 tattoos on my left arm that I would have otherwise NEVER GOTTEN. Probably one of my biggest regrets out of everything. Just chop off my arm please. I was never a tattoo person. Guess I am now.  $7,000 on mushrooms, weed and ketamine   $2,000 on new phones? I gave one away.   $2,000 divided up and passed out to people on the streets   $800 adoption fee for a dog I later had to give up  $3,000 on ez pass. Why? I have no fcking idea.   $1,500 on crystals  $2,000 on tye dye clothes that I’ll never wear again   $4,000 on new furniture that I ended up putting on the side of the street.   Honestly, there were so many things. A lot I can’t remember and I’ve been too horrified to look at bank statements, pictures and videos. Blacked out from mania and shrooms/ket. But the biggest?  I spent THOUUUUSANDS on touring with Dead and co for 2 months. I went to 12 shows and I was front row for each one. I also thought John Mayer would fall in love with me if I did so. Pit tickets, flights and hotels all over the country…   Oh and I forgot to mention that I also found my way on to a couple of well-known reality shows (not main cast) due to how insane I was acting. Some of my friends at that time were main cast; I can’t say which because that’s way too specific and I’m already giving up too much detail in this post 😂🙈. Let’s just say I don’t think we’re friends anymore…  I eventually lost my job, my apartment, my car, my reputation, family and friends. But what did I gain? 38k left over in tax debt after being audited (that’s after paying what I thought I owed). I did MY OWN taxes while manic too. WTF?  The irs owns my ass and now I’m on a payment plan.   My family put me in the hospital for a month, I was diagnosed with bipolar and placed (hopefully temporarily) on disability. Now I’m back living w mom and dad at 33. I had an amazing job and life in nyc for 10 years — it all crumbled.   So, I’ve been hiding since. Haven’t touched social and I’ve deleted most of my insta feed. Deleted Facebook. I worked in pr and a lot of my job was social, and now I’ve disappeared 🤷🏻‍♀️  I’m pretty sure people think I stalk John Mayer after posting him 14836x at so many shows front row. High school friends, college friends, work friends, family… they’ve all distanced themselves and I’ve lost almost everyone aside from a few who I am SO grateful for. The tea was HOT that year, and being the talk of your hometown is never good.   Like I said there’s a lot more to it. But you know what? In 2022 when I got out of the hospital, I took the $4000 I had left and bought more.   And I’m not fucking selling.      Wow that was cathartic. Anyway, love you.

Heywood, who invested $740,000 with Pleterski, has been charged with kidnapping, conspiring to kidnap, and confining Pleterski. The bankruptcy trustee has been cooperating with the police investigation.

The video shows Pleterski explaining what happened to the money he was given and apologizing to investors. Heywood resigned as an inspector in the bankruptcy proceedings and is one of five men facing charges related to Pleterski's alleged kidnapping. Pleterski's father previously reported that his son was beaten and tortured during the kidnapping.

If congestion occurs, traffic picks up, or Solana price increase these values will exponentially grow.  The key takeway besides the changing of monetary they are voting for themselves, there is an exposed with having 0% burn fee where the validators will collide to stuff blocks with worthless transactions or copy pasta dozen of ore scripts to manipulate priority fees for profit with no risk.  Just thought people should be aware of thus high level centralization and what a lot to consider theft and a bait and switch to steal from investors after traffic and priority fees increased to nearly 90% of all fees on Solana. The level of greed from these validators should be shunned by every solana holder.

OP is bullshitting that this only benefits validators.  **The main purpose is to fix a prisoner's dilemma situation, and avoid off-chain side-deals.**  The problem with Solana is that it doesn't use a public mempool and doesn't have a strong separation between block builders and proposers. And it hasn't solved MEV.  Any rational Solana user would purposely pay less fees by side-dealing with the validators directly. And that's a huge issue after the recent 1.18.11 and related updates.  Of course, there are probably better solutions for fixing the economic incentives through other means. I see this as a temporary workaround for a broken situation.",Most people don't really care. The narrative has been lost for a while now and it's just a big money grab thing.    For people coming from ETH the fees are still pretty low.  For average user they couldn't care less about validators or tokenomics or fees as well since most of them are just there to gamble.

This can differ from the amount displayed in the interface, due to how fast prices can change with low cap coins, and due to how transactions are ordered in a block. There are also tokens that will tax transactions, so for those you need to set slippage to higher percentages than usual.   Bots can take advantage of this mechanism by looking at transactions (tx) that are pending to be included in the next block. If they have a higher than needed slippage, that margin can be exploited. The bots will send a bundle transaction including your own. One buy tx before your tx, your tx, and one sell tx. The buy tx changes the price/token ratio in a calculated way so that your tx will get you the minimum possible amount of tokens allowed by your slippage. In the final sell tx, the bot will have made some profit. This amount can vary between a few cents or a few million, depending on how big your transaction was and how much you messed up with slippage.

cryptocurrency,May,1cmb1x4,Here are 3 onchain indicators that can show you how overheated the market is without looking at the price,"Hey,     ever noticed how BTC at $63k can feel totally different from one week to the next?  Now you might wonder why.  Sure, market sentiment is a big factor, but there’s more to it.  Think about this: When BTC was at $16k in 2017, everyone was euphoric.  Fast-forward to 2022, and BTC hits $16k again, and suddenly, everyone's in despair.  Even though the price was the same, the onchain metrics painted a vastly different picture.  In 2017 they were overheated and in 2022 they were oversold.  The biggest mistake most investors make is that they never look at onchain metrics.  **That’s why I will share my top 3 on-chain metrics with you so that you can identify the best time to sell near the peak.**  The three metrics can help you time the market without needing to look at the price of BTC are:  - **MVRV** - **NUPL** - **Puell Multiple**  ## Let’s start with MVRV  **1️⃣ MVRV (Market value realized value)**  This metric measures whether Bitcoin is overvalued compared to its historical average.  If MVRV exceeds 2, it indicates that the current price is much higher than what most holders paid, suggesting that we are moving towards the peak.  However, keep in mind the MVRV has exceeded 4.0 in 2021 which shows it can go much higher than expected.  You can look at the current BTC MVRV value [here](#).  ## 2️⃣ NUPL (Net unrealized profits and loss)  NUPL identifies the overall market sentiment by showing the proportion of Bitcoin holdings in profit or loss.  A NUPL value in the ""greed"" zone (above 0.7) is very strongly correlated with market tops.  The higher it goes the stronger the sell signal.  You can look at the current NUPL value [here](#).  ## 3️⃣ Puell Multiple  This onchain metric compares the daily earnings of Bitcoin miners against the average over the past year.   View the Puell Multiple chart [here](#).  **Here’s how to use the Puell Multiple:**  Puell Multiple &gt; 2.5 = You should sell up to 25%+ of your BTC/alts on upward moves. This will give you a lot of capital to buy back during capitulation events.  Puell Multiple &gt; 5 = You should be selling 75%+ of your BTC portfolio. Furthermore, you must set sell orders for your altcoins, as they often pump after BTC pumps.

cryptocurrency,May,1cstsox,How am I this bad at crypto.,"How am I this bad…   I’m so disappointed rn :(  I’ve been buying crypto on Coinbase since may 2021..  I just added up the Coinbase deposits from my bank..   I invested $15,000 over the past 3 years. As of Right now my portfolio is worth only $17,500.  I didn’t realize I was this close to being in the negative…  (I might actually be negative bc I lost 1k or 2k in the last bull market on Robinhood bc I was a noob)  A lot of it has to do with the fact that when Bitcoin was bottomed at 16k in November 22 I didn’t have a job and I was pretty broke... still bought what I could tho  I could’ve bought a whole Bitcoin if I just got a job a few month earlier, and I probably would have too...  I started my job in March 2023 after it already pumped. And got rekt bc I kept waiting for a dip to go all in - but it never did  I got played so hard… after November 22 Bitcoin basically went up and never dipped.  I also bought the wrong coins, I put 5k into xrp at 60 cents last summer, the biggest mistake. Can’t believe it’s .50c rn.  I never sell, only buy. My hands are pure diamonds but my brain is dirt and worms.  I could’ve sold some crazy pumps but chose not to bc I didn’t feel like dealing with taxes…  I just bought all losing coins.

With AML legislation, KYC legislation, the availability of tracking software etc, the governments have more or less full control over what you do with it. As soon as you go to sell it they can see where you got it, where you stored it, where you bring it etc. The regulations set for exchanges mean that as soon as you send it, if it doesn’t meet the government regulations for that area they will simply freeze it and put it out of reach.   In these cases (again other than p2p), what benefit would someone fleeing Palestine, Ukraine etc with a trezor loaded with 2 bitcoins have when they arrive at their destination? Let’s say the person needs food as soon as they arrive in the US with nothing other than a passport, the clothes on their back and trezor. How is their trezor loaded with bitcoin going to help? They still need an exchange / bank account or ATM in order to transfer the bitcoin into fiat currency.   It has developed massively over the last decade but with that comes even more significant restrictions and regulations.

About 10 months ago, the victim approved a malicious signature and 37K in crypto assets was drained. Among the assets stolen were USDT and PRE tokens.  Instead of revoking token access or using a fresh wallet, the victim refunded the wallet losing another 51K in USDT.  Below is an image of the movements from the victim's wallet to the scammer wallets.   [Above is a look inside the victim wallet of 0x6B099633b4b4F0eec2721f706B7F2a3b6D6c6a8F.](https://preview.redd.it/bhhsoj38m8zc1.png?width=2232&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdca22372dd4c06273d7da7f46df1d57217c8a7c)  It sucks to lose funds once to a phishing scam.

The victim could of been scammed from a phishing website promising rewards, a fake airdrop or through other means. The point is, the victim gave approval to the scammer for token transfers.  Permit2 approvals allow scammers to spend an unlimited amount of your tokens. In this case, Inferno Drainer was used on the backend to do the dirty work of draining the victim's wallet of 31.3K of USDT and 5.5K PRE tokens.  [Above is the Etherscan transaction receipt. The victim gave Unlimited Approval of USDT from his wallet of 0x6B099633b4b4F0eec2721f706B7F2a3b6D6c6a8F to the malicious contract of 0x0000553F880fFA3728b290e04E819053A3590000 \(Inferno Drainer\).](https://preview.redd.it/o0xy63nwh8zc1.png?width=2696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d9ed76e6e59bfd9b196ceb8835b9f60df07d0ab)  # How Permit2 Works  Permit2 is a versatile smart contract designed for managing approvals in an intuitive way. Once users give it an unlimited approval, Permit2 opens up the possibility for further delegating permissions to other smart contracts.   I've talked about the downsides of Permit2 in previous posts. The upside is it provides less friction for the end user. The user doesn't need to send separate token approvals and Permit2 enables gas free signatures for the tokens.  Scammers can abuse this function because most users don't know what they are approving. Additionally, phishing websites can trick victims into giving scammers approval to multiple tokens at once through Permit2.  # Drained a 2nd Time  Without revoking approval access, the scammer can go back for a 2nd helping of your crypto. I can see on-chain the victim sent 51.5K in USDT from his clean wallet to the phished wallet. About 3 days later, that 51.5K now belongs to the scammer.

I'll post in the comments below.  # How to Revoke All Token Approvals  The easiest and simplest way is to use **revoke.cash**. It's good practice to periodically check the permissions you allow on your wallet every few months.  Phishing scammers can be extremely sophisticated and expert tricksters. It's very easy to interact with a malicious contract without understanding the risks.  If you believe you've engaged with a malicious smart contract, you're going to want to immediately revoke all approvals.  Below are the steps:  1. Go to **revoke.cash** 2. Connect your wallet (Please make sure it's the actual revoke.cash!) 3. Give authorization 4.

The only reason the CFTC has been largely unscathed in the eye of the public with regards to its regulations is that most people aren’t trading oil futures, corn derivatives, etc.   CFTC regulations are the most convoluted piece of shits ever. Do you want to have all offering materials go through 5 levels of CFTC review contradicting themselves each time?   The SEC gets a ton of flak and rightfully so with their gunslinger attitude and inconsistency under Gensler especially with respect to digital assets.   You don’t like the SEC? You DEFINITELY will abhor the CFTC.   Modernization unfortunately needs to happen at the congressional level but until we get a large change in the age make-up of Congress we’re going to be stuck in digital asset no man’s land for a while.","This is stupid. If you do that, all the US startups can then go public early via ICOs and make the SEC meaningless. Plenty of shady enterprises and Wall Street funds would find a good loophole against the SEC regulations by moving to “crypto”."

cryptocurrency,May,1cof3vk,Seeing all this HYPE surrounding Trump's apparent support for crypto inspired me to provide some insight,"Trump spent his presidency making promises of what he was going to deliver to us citizens in his term. He is willing to do and say anything to advance his aspirations of power.  In his term:   He promised jobs - never delivered  He promised infrastructure - never delivered  He promised Healthcare - never delivered  He promised middle class tax cuts - never delivered (gave tax cuts to the rich instead)   He was not pro-crypto during his term either and just flip flopped now that he thinks it can garner him some swing votes.  Surely he will deliver this time, though. Surely.   Trump has also been found guilty of defrauding the people of New York to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Do you think he has your best interests in mind when it comes to your coin? Or is it just another empty promise to help him get what he wants?   Even if you are a single issue voter, you can't (in his conscience/good faith) take his word on anything.   I don't care for either candidate but to simply take Trump's word at face value, just because it sounds good, is the reason we have so many clowns running the show on both sides of the isle right now.   Also, let's not forget that the government is never going to be a friend to bitcoin. Bitcoin is a mechanism of attaining self-sovereignty, amongst many other pro's. The established power structure only cares about one thing: staying in power at all costs.   Keep government out of crypto.   *Debate is encouraged, but provide counter-points*",He'll say anything he can think of to get out of his current predicament,"I mean, he was so clearly pandering.

He did, however, state he was in favor of the US dollar and the US dollar exclusively when asked about crypto and didn't see crypto backed by anything other than thin air.  His opinion has since changed, and it changed well before this most recent statement. Trump began selling NFTs in 2022.  Trump has also stated he owns crypto. He allegedly has over 60 different tokens in his portfolio and is said to be valued over $5.6Million *as of 3 days ago*.  In March of this year, Donald Trump suggested that if he were elected president again, his administration would not crack down on the use of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies through regulatory authority.  I believe that. Because during his term, the SEC wasn't *launching an all out attack* against crypto like they have been since Biden placed Gary Gensler at the head of the SEC in April 2021.    I **strongly** recommend people educate themselves further than one issue and not just vote with one issue in mind, however, *if you are a one issue voter*, I think it's quite straightforward and obvious on which candidate you would choose. Anyone arguing that is trying to convince you to vote for *their guy*","Biden/Warren and a lot of democrats have been trying to strangle it. E.g.

cryptocurrency,Jun,1dku9g1,Lost 100 000$ in a scam.,"It happened to me. Something I though would never happened. Especially like this.  I received a call from the support department of a hardware wallet company (that I will not mention) saying that there was an attempt to connect to my dashboard (of that company). Which right here doesnt make sense. His name was Thierry. He asked me to open the dashboard and upgrade it to the latest version. After it was upgraded, still in the dashboard, he asked me to click a link that redirect to the official website of the hardware wallet company. A couple a minute on that website, and of course, something was wrong. I had to enter manually another website and update my hardware wallet. That website was a fake of course and I add to enter my seed phrase to ''upgrade'' it. And by know you probably know the rest... I have a hard time writing it (because I'm ashamed and I feel stupid) as I write this post but yes, I did write my seed phrase on the website. Something you should never do of course.  1 minute after the call I contacted the hardware wallet company and they told me that they don't call their customer (you probably can guess why) and that it was a scam. I've sent them the website that ''upgrades shit'' and they confirmed that its was a scam. By that time my money was already gone.     My knowledge level in crypto is above average and I would never invest in something that I know nothing of. My point here is that I thought I was above scam and that would never happen to me. Especially after reading stories like mine on this sub, I was sure that I wasnt gullible enough to get scammed. And yet, here we are... I know now that there was at least 42 red flags in this call. I was suspicious the whole time of the call. Here's some stuff that confused/trow me off. They had my physical address (I'm pretty sure how they got it now that I know its a scam), they sent me an e-mail with a ''legit'' email address (not like scamangel@gmail.com) to confirm that the ''attempt to connect to my dashboard'' was cleared. Thierry spoke my native language, which is not English. The call/scam took around 35 minutes.   I'm still unsure how I managed to write my seed phrase somewhere else than in a book. Like if I'd receive another call (while I was entering my seed phrase on the fake website) saying ''you are entering your seed phrase on a website'', I would've probably paused and think for a second. But Thierry was a good mf and I guess I believed him.  And just fyi, this was crypto that I bought way back then, some 6 years ago. I was in the 20x/2000%, like in a fucking dream. This money wasnt need for my short term survival in society and I will not attempt anything on myself or something, so don't worry on that front. But I was hoping to live an early retirement in a paid house or something. Not that it matter in the end...  The lesson here, and there is one in each good post of stories like mine, is not ''not your key not your coin'' or ''dont say to other people that you own crypto'' or something cliché like that. The lesson here is ''KNOW YOUR FUCKING SHIT''. When the guy called and said that he was working for the company, I should've known that it was a scam and hang up. When I contacted the company after the facts, this is the first thing they told me: we dont call or contact people.    Also, I've reported the scam to the company and the police. And I know I'm not going to get this money back.  And, just to be clear, its not the blockchain or my phone or my pc or my hardware wallet or any part of the ''blockchain system/ecosystem'' that failed me... I failed/fuck myself.   I'll stop rambling...  If you want to leave a nice comment and cheer me up, you can. But I'd like you to do me a better one and spend some of your coins and have a good time or give a good time to someone else....even if you're in the red...  And hey! I can now answer my dm's!

If the price of Bitcoin doesn't keep doubling then this means the security budget will reduce over time.  There are 28 more halvings left to go, that means that unless the marketcap of BTC reaches $338,228,674,560,000,000,000 (in 2024 dollars) the security of the network will be lower than it is today. Do you think a marketcap of $338 Quintillion is likely...  And before you claim that transaction fees will just make up the difference... at that price a transaction fee would be about 200 million times more expensive than it is today, so around $460 million to send BTC, or even more for some poor sucker trying to set up a non-custodial lightning wallet...

The court considered imposing up to seven years in prison for Wright's lies under the Perjury Act 1911. The proceedings highlighted the chilling effect of Wright's actions on crypto development and the need for injunctive relief to prevent him from further disseminating false claims.

Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.   Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term lazy crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, AMKT is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: would I have been better off with $1,000 of **AMKT** instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 **AMKT**.  Five  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:   https://preview.redd.it/rejsiyr8gj6d1.png?width=457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a1e72b240857e84c85a95e55ff19a8dc50852d6  May Performances:  * The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio: +13%  * **AMKT:** +15%.  The May monthly victory goes to: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**)  Overall since January 1st, 2024:   * The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio: +24% *  **AMKT**: +48%  Overall lead: The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (**AMKT**), with exactly double the ROI of the Top Ten Portfolio.  For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/6mem28nagj6d1.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a45c2d10848a349d45d60288b88ac7d34dc7696a  # Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +23% (total value $1,234) * 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +526% (total value $6,263) * 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +813% (total value $9,130) (best performing portfolio) * 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +230% (total value $3,287) * 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -39% (total value $615) (worst performing portfolio) * [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +101% (total value $2,014) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4): up +24% (total value $1,237)  Taking the seven portfolios together:  After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, the combined portfolios are worth $23,780.   That’s up +240% on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [November 2021’s all time high](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of +533%.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:  https://preview.redd.it/ktjznjwbgj6d1.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf82a56bd34a7b2c3fb46e4e8c318a108120bea7  In summary: That’s a +240% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years.  # Comparison to S&amp;P 500  I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  https://preview.redd.it/lmckqardgj6d1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f83b154347afc02cf87c8a444c98e24c7e292644  The S&amp;P 500 is up +11% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,110 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,970 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,110 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,630 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,410 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,110 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,370 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,110 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:   After seven $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $10,710.  That is up +53% [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a +240% gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/onkecv4fgj6d1.png?width=1370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c420543e93e7b9fcdcda0d210ad4b09575897eca  # Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long.

cryptocurrency,Jun,1df0f4q,Wake Me Up When September Ends,"Some of you need to hear this....  I keep seeing people all hyped up about upcoming rate cuts, like somehow this is going to spur a massive bull run.  What you need to understand is that after a period of the Feds increasing interest rates, economic/financial instability arrives on the back end during or shortly after rate cuts. I won't use the word recession because it also seems to be triggering here.  September seems to be lining up as the first rate cut and historically September is also a very bad month for the stock market. I'm banking on it being a bloodbath.  The only thing that could possibly hold this off is the November election. The current government has been hiring part time workers at an alarming rate, the full-time worker numbers are dismal and once the government slows down and starts laying off these part-time workers the true jobs numbers will be impossible to ignore.  Either way the end of 2024 isn't going to be some Golden Bull Run, it's going to be pain, and BTC is still behaving like a risk on asset at the moment.  If you are speculating and don't plan to hold for 5+ years you should re-evaluate your position. The HODL crew should be okay, I don't expect BTC to go anywhere you just might be waiting a bit longer to see the coveted $100k.  TLDR: Rate cuts in the fall do not equal a massive bull run. Rate cuts that come on the tail end of rapidly increased rates end in pain. Just google Fed Interest Rates, expand the chart out to Max. The grey are recessions.

This explains the current soft dump + crabbing well.   We can take this as a buying opportunity before small miners capitulate and the bull run start, 3 months after this.","tldr; Bitcoin miners are increasing their selling activity due to declining revenues following the recent halving event, which has led to a drop in transaction fees and miner earnings. Over the past week, Bitcoin's price fell by 4.5%, reaching a monthly low of $65,000, partly due to this increased selling. CryptoQuant's report highlights a two-month high in BTC transfers from miners to exchanges, with significant sales from large mining companies like Marathon Digital. Daily miner revenues have decreased by 55% since March, and the high network hashrate is adding financial pressure on miners, demanding more resources for transaction validation and block addition.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.","Alright, you convinced me. I'll double DCA amount this week","All this rethoric about miners etc is mostly bullshit. Yes, miners are now earning half the bitcoin reward than in the previous epoch. So? Look at btc price. Btc was 30k in October of 2023. At that time miners had the same total reward than right now. (Half the btc reward but double the price per coin). So any miners in trouble now would be ones that were already in trouble then. All miners know that the halving is coming. That’s the only certain thing about btc. So if you’re a miner in trouble now you’re not a very good miner.","Well, the algorithm is more difficult now, so takes more computing power thus an increased cost for electricity/cooling/hardware upgrades etc.   So you're not making the same money really, particularly if total hashrate has increased.",Zoom out  We are are still ahead.,Over the last week most miner share prices jumped up while Bitcoin itself went down.,Capitulate? Centralize?  Won't this keep happening til it becomes extremely centralized?  I'm all for hard money and Bitcoin but I don't see how it works long term. Each halving needs price to skyrocket or have fees go way up. Either way it centralizes the network and also prices out small buyers because they can't afford the fees. No one wants to pay $10+ to transfer $50 of BTC.  Yes there is lightning but that still has on chain fees.  I would love to see what the prices need to be and estimated fees to sustain Bitcoin long term after each halving.,"Yes, bitcoin will make new highs either soon or within the next 18 months.  My post is about bitcoin surviving in its current form in the next 4-12 years, which I don't think is possible, nor do I have faith in the community to resolve without civil wars and multiple forks similar to what happened a few years ago.  Personally, I think bitcoin (first gen tech) has run its course.  However, I freely admit the market has NOT come to the same conclusion.  But if you look at the narrowing the bitcoin's use cases from global currency, to expensive, slow payments, to now 'digital gold' (e.g., buy it, it does nothing, sell it later for more fiat), it starts to appear closer to classic [Greater Fool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) scenario.    Meanwhile, you have ETH (to includes its entire ecosystem), which is programmable money with its multiple intact use-cases (including bitcoin's sole use-case), continuing to be misunderstood by the market despite capturing the vast bulk of TVL, developer interest, dapp deployment, all while successfully deploy major upgrades without service interruptions.    Or you can as sum all that up in one statistics:  Ethereum is the only L1 that is profitable.    Not even bitcoin can make that claim.    In short, bitcoin can still be profitable in the next 4-12 years, but Ethereum has a bigger short term upside, much better fundamentals, and a rosier outlook in the long term.    If your time horizon is short-term, bitcoin is still a legitimate play.  If you timeline is medium or long-term, I'd look to ETH or even traditional markets for safer plays.","I have been asking/wondering about this question for a long time now and this post is kind of what I assumed but everyone seemed to disagree. Cutting the value of a currency or the amount you receive of that currency in half every four years doesn't seem like a great way to ensure long term survival. That only makes sense if there is an underlying assumption of intrinsic value.   I am long BTC so I am not betting against it, but setting a cap and then cutting the amount you can access in half only causes scarcity not value. People still need to believe it has value."
cryptocurrency,Jun,1djw70b,Kraken claims it is being 'extorted' as white hat hacker demands reward after $3M theft ,,Ya you see white hats regularly get a 5 or 10k reward for discovering an exploit that would have allowed them to take millions.   Doesn't exactly incentivize the best to work on it.,There was an article on here when some whitehat didn’t steal the money but made the company aware of a few M$ vulnerability and was given some measly reward for pointing that out to the company without exploiting it,Why not disclose that it’s Certik the audit firm that is causing the drama,[deleted],I think you mean a black hat,"tldr; Kraken, a US-based crypto exchange, reported being extorted by a security researcher who exploited a bug to steal $3 million in digital assets. The researcher, after using the bug to withdraw funds, demanded a reward for returning the stolen assets. Kraken's Chief Security Officer, Nick Percoco, stated that this act of demanding a reward after exploiting a vulnerability constitutes extortion, not white-hat hacking. The stolen cryptocurrency came from Kraken's treasury, ensuring no user funds were at risk. The incident underscores the increasing threat of crypto hacks and exploits.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.",Gotta be like Wormhole with their sweet $10M bounty reward.,Yeah every legit whitehat knows you don't just steal the funds (unless it is something that is actively being exploited already and done to rescue some percentage of assets and in that case you don't demand a reward payment to send them back....),Why do that? They could just 3 million instead of 200K. It's illegal either way.,"He's the good guy, its protection money."
cryptocurrency,Jun,1douyqu,Cardano Unfazed By Failed DDoS Attack Targeting Staked ADA,,Cardano: Good luck next time hackers.,"Not a vulnerability, it's mitigated by the protocol design 😏","It was not targeting staked ADA.  As usual we see a negative spin on any Cardano news, even positive news.  The attack used scripts that didn't do anything, but that each node had to deserialise and read to confirm.  Because the scripts had no execution steps and we're not signed, they were cheap and many could be put into an L1 transaction.  Piling 194 scripts into a TX and then flooding the mempool, made nodes work a bit harder and slowed block propagation a bit, and took space from regular transactions.  But everything remained well within safety limits.  I was actually using Cardano at the time, and I didn't notice any problems.  In fact the attacker wasn't censored, because the scripts were using an unsigned stake address (which made them smaller/cheaper) the 2ADA staking registration fee wasn't locked, meaning anyone could remove the 2 ADA x 194 scripts. Essentially the attack transactions went from costing 1ADA each to 389ADA each.  The attacker gave away lots of ADA and transaction fees, and achieved a very minor impact.","The attacker also wasn't targeting staked funds. It's a DDoS attack, which stands for denial of service. They were trying to make network resources unavailable by spamming the network. They weren't trying to steal anything. Come on Coindesk, it's not that difficult to Google or ask ChatGPT what a DDoS is.  Some Cardano developers came together on a call and found one way to mess with the attacker and used a protocol feature to their advantage to make it even more expensive for the attacker. The attacker was listening in on the call, but was still too late and ended up paying to a Cardano developer working for Anastasia Labs, a firm developing an L2 for Cardano. The developer said the funds will go towards their development of Midgard. During the attack, the community was minting a DDoS meme token and an [NFT memento](https://x.com/nmkr_io/status/1805668309024506152). An [SPO ](https://x.com/PoolShamrock/status/1805723336665604192)also managed to trace the transactions back to the attacker's CEX account.","No no, don't give them any luck. My ADA bag doesn't need a successful attack!","The article and this summary are incorrect, staked ADA was not targeted, and the attacker paid a high price for a failed attack.",Just tanking it like a champ,People now see the real power of Cardano. Glad to see.,"That may be true if they were routing their swaps through Minswap v1 which takes long even without a ddos attack, but Sundae v3 swaps were still only taking a few minutes for me during the attack.     There's a [change](https://x.com/intertreeJK/status/1805652581252800673) which is included in the next Chang upgrade that addresses this type attack. You can also make these type of attacks more expensive and less impactful by increasing throughput and adding different tx routes with upgrades like Leios, tiered pricing, and other changes down the pipeline.","tldr; The Cardano blockchain successfully defended against a DDoS attack aimed at stealing staked tokens, with no significant impact on its operations. The attack involved transactions that executed numerous smart contracts, but was quickly mitigated after a vulnerability was exposed by a Cardano developer, leading to the attacker's funds being seized. The network continued to function normally throughout the incident.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR."

It supports eight networks initially and offers features like asset and identity management, and NFTs.

Imagine the scenario, you have an app that requires a wallet in order to use it. Most classic web apps just use email and password authentication to generate a token, and that token lets you access the APIs and services of the web app.  But in web3, you must have a wallet in order to interact with smart contracts on Ethereum. If you’re a layman who doesn’t know what a wallet is, smart wallets let developers create and host wallets on behalf of a user, tying the keys to a standard user authentication flow. So now you can access web3 apps and get an in-app wallet that lets your users interact with smart contracts, without them really even knowing. They just sign in with an email and password, and the wallet is connected automatically in the backend.  It’s a great way to onboard people into web3, and it’s fantastic that more options are becoming available too as Magic and ThirdWeb are the current major players.   It’s a developer and user experience feature. Something I’ve been working with for the past year to build an e-commerce platform for mavericksplaylist.com"

The upside is not about a 2.25% annual yield. They are up more than 1100% in 4 years.   Buying MSTR is like buying a leveraged Bitcoin ETF instead of a spot Bitcoin ETF...  By borrowing against their BTC holdings Mocrostrategy can acquire more BTC per share of MSTR. Thus, when BTC goes up, MSTR goes up more because they keep buying more Bitcoin per share. And because they are buying with long-term convertible debt (more than 4 years) they can coast through bear cycles with pretty much zero liquidation risk. It's pretty ingenious and very, very profitable. This is precisely what makes Saylor such a badass.   If you are a long-term BTC investor and BTC believer, you would be crazy not to buy and hold some MSTR. Especially in a tax-free retirement account."

Members of the vice-president’s team have contacted people close to crypto companies about meeting in recent days, said four people with knowledge of the matter. Those include leading exchange Coinbase, stablecoin company Circle and blockchain payments group Ripple Labs, two of the people said.  The vice-president’s office and the Harris campaign declined to comment. Ripple and Coinbase declined to comment. Circle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Harris’s overture to crypto companies comes as Trump enjoys strong levels of support from the sector. The former president — once a vocal crypto sceptic — has thrown his weight behind the industry and is delivering the keynote speech at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville on Saturday.  Crypto groups will probably be an important source of funding for candidates in the election: pro-crypto super Pac Fairshake has raised more than $200mn from backers including Coinbase, Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz, according to filings.  People advising the Harris campaign on business matters said the decision to reconnect with the crypto industry had little to do with attracting new electoral contributions. They said the objective was instead to build a constructive relationship that would ultimately set a smart regulatory framework that would help the growth of the entire asset class.  The outside advisers to the campaign said Harris wanted to change the perception among many top executives America that the Democrats were anti-business. One person said her campaign was using the change of leadership on the Democratic ticket as an opportunity to reset relations with the tech industry, which had felt targeted by the Biden administration, particularly on antitrust matters.  The underlying message Harris wants to strike is that the Democrats are “pro-business, responsible business”, said one person close to her campaign.  Harris is aiming to win back those in the tech community, many of them in her home state of California, who have turned away from the party in protest at the threat of new taxes or regulation of their industry.  This month, venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz announced they would back Trump in the election, having previously supported several Democratic candidates. Their firm, Andreessen Horowitz, claims to be the largest crypto investor in the world and raised about $8bn to invest in the sector.  When they announced their support for Trump, the two venture capitalists railed against Joe Biden’s White House and Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission. “They have just fought us every step of the way, and using very nefarious means,” Horowitz said at the time. “They are nuking the industry.”  Some crypto companies are hopeful Harris will be more sympathetic to them. “The fact that she’s willing to listen is a big deal. With Biden you couldn’t even get a meeting . . . It has left people with such a bad view of the Biden administration,” one crypto company executive said.","Naw, my Daughter deserves rights, I'm going to pass on Trump."

The shell company, the highest level I am able to get without any granted powers, is luck7.inc. This is a company based in South East Asia, operating in at least Shanghai, Ho Chi Min City &amp; Manila.   This company, is the registrar organisation and currently the highest owner (I am able to find) of multiple scam websites, all with the same appearance. Websites such as Oexbake.top/oexbake.com/oexgeek.xyz/ordioex.com/oexgeek.online/ordioex.top/ordioex.xyz  These are just a few that I have found. There are more, some operated so long they expired.   This company, primarily operates, but not exclusively, Romance Pig Butchering Scams. They are using paid actresses who will act like they are in a relationship with the victim. These actress are used in photos, videos, voice notes, phone calls &amp; video calls. The actress will even try and convince you use the website, or invest more whilst on these calls, so they know fully well what is going on, even if they are not fully involved. My scammer was “western” not just the usual usage of “Asian” women. My scammer was called Emily Campbell, she pretended to be from Australia and living in Perth, Scotland. She actually lives in Southampton, because she took a video of her apartment, that I asked for when after I realised was being scammed, but before she knew I had realised. The address was ascertained from a screenshot. While I know she wasn’t the one person I was most probably talking to, the phone calls and video calls with references to our messages and the investing, meant she is involved enough to know the morale repercussions of what she is choosing to do.   When I first asked about oexbake.top, weeks ago now on another website, so showed me the post. Extremely upset - she did not know it was mine, and I pretended it wasn’t. This confirmed the scam, as they have operators lurking in r / cryptoscams.   I have reported everything, to all appropriate authorities, who have called it an international cyber risk.   I hope this post, will stay live, and allow multiple people avoid these scams in the future. Regardless of what the organisation decide or try to do.

After the scammer gained access to my uncle's PC via AnyDesk, he instructed my uncle to ""go check the modem to see if the lights are blinking for activity.""

The scammer also withdrew all BTC.

After draining the entire account, the scammer instructed my uncle to log into his bank accounts. At this point, he finally called me. I instructed him to stop talking to the scammers and shutdown his PCs immediately.  We contacted Coinbase support, and they sent us a link to file a police report with the FBI [here](https://www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx/), which we already did.

The Court found that Dr Wright “lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly” in his evidence and that he attempted to create a false narrative by forging documents “on a grand scale” and presenting them in evidence. Overall, “all his lies and forged documents were in support of his biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.” In advancing his false claim to be Satoshi through multiple legal actions, Dr Wright committed “a most serious abuse” of the process of the courts of the UK, Norway and the USA. The High Court formally declared as follows:  First, that Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper.  Second, Dr Wright is not the owner of the copyright in the Bitcoin White Paper.  Third, Dr Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period between 2008 and 2011.  Fourth, Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin system.  Fifth, Dr Wright is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin Software.  The full judgment, and its appendix detailing various forged documents created by Dr Wright, is accessible at the following URL: [https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/copa-v-wright/](https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/copa-v-wright/).

Nowadays I’m sad to see that US political indoctrination has invaded this sub hugely. It’s not about crypto anymore, it’s about Trump or Harris of Biden. Of course it has always been inevitable that politics would interfere. But as a crypto community let’s not be another ‘red’ vs ‘blue’.

This shift in user preference towards Monero, known for its privacy features, reflects a broader trend observed in both darknet and Clearnet markets. Despite Bitcoin validating more transactions overall, Monero processes more transactions relative to its market value, indicating a growing popularity for payments. This increase in demand for XMR could potentially impact its price, which has seen a significant recovery since Binance's delisting.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

I was the guy that saw everyone disappear when the prices crashed. I was the guy who made crypto friends. I was the guy that people think is mentally ill (they probably have a valid point).As a side note, this is not my first ride. I got very lucky in real estate.  many of you have or will jump socio-economic levels. For some, that means having a few months of savings. For others, it's having a reliable car. For others, it's going from a little to having millions.     I started my career in 2007. I met a guy who had 10+ houses and lost all of them. I met a guy who spent 600k (today's value 1+ mill) on a backyard remodel-and then lost the house.  I met a guy who making $300k in his 20s (today value 700k when factoring in taxes) and walked away from that job because he thought he new everything. I met a guy who had a ferrari and 3 condos at 34 and at 42 has a 2 bedroom condo. The guy who got me into crypto bought at $2,000 and can never rebuy his position. EVER.

You now have no electric bill, a house bill that Is easy, and no ""gas"" bill. you are protected for at least 10 years.   Give something to someone that matters.

A for profit company that is trying to get banks and central banks to adopt its currency. Banks and central banks will be the last to adopt crypto and will only adopt something that the masses use.  This company only has a billion dollars in cash, has 1100 employees, and the rest of its assets, purportedly 25 billion, is in mostly ripple.  So essentially anytime the price goes up they are incentivized to sell Ripple from the balance sheet to help cover cost.

Do any other big crypto companies/ organisations do the same?,Gotta love a question like this on a sub where a good number of members are quick to buy the latest coin based on it having a cool name alone.  Most of them not even bothered to produce a white paper anymore.,"A ponzi scheme tries to find new investors to pay off the previous investors because the previous investor's assets were used to pay off someone else up the chain. The entire premise is essentially a comingling of funds situation. At a certain point, if enough investors down the road come calling, there will be no money left because the assets were not held in custody for the actual person who deposited it.  A true crypto ponzi scheme would be more like if an exchange wasn't actually holding your coins, and relied on new investors to add in coins to the exchange that are used behind the scenes to pay off earlier accounts whose coins they used to pay off someone previous to that.   As long as 1 XRP = 1 XRP and you have full custody, it is not a Ponzi. It doesn't matter that Ripple holds a huge amount in escrow. They still own their coins and you own yours. No one's coins are being used to pay someone else's that were misplaced/mishandled earlier on.  Now, whether or not half the supply not being released can have bigger issues down the road, that is a completely different question. But everyone knows exactly how much Ripple is held by them, how much can be (and is) released, and so on. There is nothing hidden about that. If you choose to invest in XRP, you should know that is a thing that is happening. But this is happening very, very publicly.  Yes, I hold XRP. But yes, I also recognize that is an issue. But that doesn't make it a Ponzi."

The country's transaction volume reached approximately $85.4 billion by July 2023. Unlike other investors, Argentinians primarily purchase stablecoins like USDT, seeking stability rather than speculative gains. The high inflation and weakening currency have pushed Argentinians towards cryptocurrencies as an alternative to the unstable Peso and inaccessible dollar.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Remember that guy who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars for a party in the Metaverse and nobody showed up or something,It’s a boring video game .  Spending so much money to buy virtual land where you can’t physically go and where no one cares about because there are already plenty other games .  You can easily buy GTA 5 for 20$ and buy virtual property with in game money and the world there is actually fun plus you can also play it online and there are bounties and other fun things to do.  No need for useless crypto and especially no need to spend 200k or whatever for virtual goods when you can have much better experience with much better graphics for almost no money   Every single crypto based game will have the same ending as new games comes out all the time and crypto isn’t needed and doesn’t fix any problems besides making the game unfun as people only buy them because they think they will get rich   Hell you can just install Minecraft and build your own property and invite your friends for a b day party and if you want a lot of other players around you could get an MMORPG like WoW and actually meet people in game,Almost beats the nft ape party that used medical decontamination lights and gave a bunch of people snow blindness/eye damage.,This is funny,"Metaverse is stupid, VR gaming tho?

When you fast travel, when you open menus, when you alt-tab out of the game.   It likes to just freeze. So you log in, have the OTP sent, copy it from your email/phone to your desktop, and respawn at the default area. So now you have to remember where you were and how to get there. So you open travel menu, and whoops froze again. Login, OTP, etc. It's actually more convenient to pick a spot and just not leave there. Just like the 5 other people in the game.

I guess that froze too.","I mean the funny thing is we've seen actual ""metaverse"" come to fruition like what epic has done with fortnite, basically making it Roblox v2.    The problem with the crypto metaverses is like building a product without an established audience/use case, hoping to find it a long the way. Chicken and egg type thing. I forgot which but it had pretty good tech for world/assets/game building, and all those assets could be bought from the asset makers for game makers to use. So had an ecosystem too......but not the userbase from a player standpoint to actually validate the systems.  Could build the best social media platform ever but if no one uses it, it's worthless.   &gt;Every single crypto based game will have the same ending as new games comes out all the time and crypto isn’t needed and doesn’t fix any problems besides making the game unfun as people only buy them because they think they will get rich   You're thinking of the classic, veiled gambling /roll a dice crypto games with a nice UI/theme smacked on top that wasn't much of a game, with their own token and tradeable assets that only exist/have purpose in that game so once it started flopping would just free fall. And you weren't playing for fun because there is no real fun in 5 mins of gameplay.   The intention for these metaverses lands was to have a platform more akin to Roblox and now fortnite.   I've never played their various games, only seen kids play em. And... without kids I don't think it's very sustainable, giving the lack of depth any of those games have compared to any of the ones you mentioned."

cryptocurrency,Jul,1e4znej,Why BTC will keep going up as long as people keep predicting a crash ,"The last time BTC had an exponential move to the upside was during the last election year. This is partially because the halvening cycle and the election cycle are currently in sync every 4 years, but there’s further reasons as to why we’ll likely see much higher prices sooner rather than later.   1.) We’ve obviously been in a 5 month range. Usually, a long time of price consolidation, results in a massive move. Any move above the 70ks will be swift and large   2.) The ETH ETF approval is coming up thus further legitimizing crypto in general and allowing for even more people to easily invest   3.) Given the largely negative sentiment merely two weeks ago, there are still tons of shorts trapped. The funding rates for most derivative contracts on BTC are still very low indicating that the overall futures market is not very bullish yet despite a 10% move. This almost always indicates further upside   4.) Most of the chatter online is expecting a long boring summer and fall. BTC loves to go up after long periods of boredom and when people least expect it  But last, and most importantly, just look around you even on this sub. You’ll see comments along the lines of:  “Sounds like you’re coping and bought the top” “Let’s be real this is going back to the 40ks” “BTC is a dead asset” “If you seriously think 64k is a good price to buy BTC, you’re deluded”   Most of this sub was calling for 40ks just two weeks ago. See you in the 80s.",I wanna believe like August 2017.,"Like always, I think it will go up, down, or sideways.","Now everyone is predicting BTC to moon, so by OP’s logic are we going to crash ??",There is 9b  longs to liquidate if Btc crash to 53k vs 3b shorts if it go to 72,"I'm 100% long crypto but I'm telling you now so listen, if you base it off weird home made theories of why price is going up you're not gonna be the guy that gets off at 200k before 20k, you're gonna sell that shit at 20 WITHOUT doubt. Buy low sell high my dude, all your ""ideas"" are 100% bullshit.",BTC ETFs did fuck all? Are you kidding me? The run from 20k and onwards was purely driven from the ETF hype,"Yeah it seems that OP is making arguments based on Hopium TA rather than neutral TA, his 3rd point was saying how there are still lots of shorts to liquidate but in reality there’s a lot more longs to liquidate","One of the last bear cases for Bitcoin was that it couldn’t survive a low liquidity and high(er) Fed funds rate. Guess what, it survived and thrived.   Global liquidity is coming with 80% of central banks expected to cut rates, and a fed rate cut on the horizon.",The comments are very regarded. Any 10% upside is seen as nothing is happening. And any 10% downside is the end of the world.,I thought there was no way we broke BTC ATH prior to Nov 24' essentially due to the pattern we've seen over and over again.

I'd expect more and more altcoins to fail over time, with very few winners relative to market sectors—and conversely most tokens never reaching ATH again.   In 2017 there were far far few tokens (approx 1k total), and it was much easier to justify liquidity entering into the marginal ones as upside 'binary' bets. But fast forward to 2024 and there are (literally) 20k tokens with 66 (still an insane number imo) each being valued over 1 billion in MC.   The market is saturated and its time for most tokens to 'prove it'. Most won't imo, and you'll see a continued consolidation of the market towards the (very) few winners.","Going to bitcoin's sub and talking about alts is like walking into a kebab shop and asking for a vegan meal, lol"

After 15 years of intense research, horoscope readings, and probably a few consultations with a psychic, sadiq finally decided to YOLO his life savings into Bitcoin at its all-time high of $69K. Because who needs common sense when you’ve got FOMO, right?  For years, sadiq watched Bitcoin's wild rollercoaster, patiently telling himself, “Not yet, not yet.” He ignored the dips, the rises, and all those pesky ""Buy the dip!"" voices. Then, when the market was screaming ATH (All-Time High) at $69K, sadiq decided it was the perfect time to jump in — just as the rocket was running out of fuel.  As expected, the market crashed faster than a Tesla on autopilot, with Bitcoin plunging to a cool $15K. Naturally, sadiq did what any self-proclaimed financial guru would do: he panic-sold everything, securing those sweet -78% returns. His diamond hands? They turned to paper so fast that even origami artists were impressed.  Nowadays, sadiq's portfolio is as barren as his Tinder matches, but his life isn't without excitement. He's become a motivational speaker — unintentionally. Friends invite him to parties just to tell his story as a cautionary tale. He's also started a YouTube channel titled ""Sadiq's Financial Follies,"" where he reviews get-rich-quick schemes while sipping boxed wine.","He sold his BTC on the first 10% pump in 2013, he got rich in the last few years shilling 💩 coins with that Moon Carl guy lol.

I've paid \~$8,000 in interest so far and currently have a \~$45,000 remaining balance.   The average price I paid is \~$29,550 per Bitcoin which brings my cost basis to \~$133,000. The current value of the Bitcoin as of today, August 16th, is \~$265,000 which comes to a 99% profit or \~$132,500 in dollar terms.   I have no plans to sell any of it. Just buy and hold. I service the debt with earned income from my job. I can easily afford the payments. I should have it all paid off by summer of 2025… so long as I don’t take out even more loans to buy more Bitcoin!  I’ve made updates every 6 months. Feel free to view my post history to learn more about my strategy.    Two of the most Frequently Asked Questions I get.  1. **Why take out loans when I could just buy Bitcoin from earned income?**    I do that as well, but if I only did that, then I would not have been able to buy nearly as much Bitcoin as I did at the lowest prices. Back in 2022, I knew we were in a bear market. I also knew that it wouldn’t last more than a year or two.   So think of it like a reverse DCA. I pay the loans each month instead of DCA. This allowed me to buy a lot more Bitcoin than I otherwise would have been able to buy. I can easily afford the monthly payments to service the debt.    **2. This is too risky. You’re insane. You’re gambling. Never take out loans to buy Bitcoin!**  Not at all… I have a thesis an a strategy!   My thesis is simple: due to reckless fiscal and monetary policy (money printing) by our government, the US dollar will continue to depreciate in value, i.e. inflation.   My strategy: take out loans in USD and buy hard assets like BTC which will appreciate in value against the USD.   The strategy is basically a speculative attack on the US dollar. Wall Street traders do the same thing all the time. Have you hear of the Yen Carry Trade? I’m doing the same thing except with USD and BTC.  Taking out loans to buy assets is fine, so long as you can afford to service them. Just don’t take out loans to buy liabilities!!!  ✌🏻","Wish I had the balls you you've had, congrats","Balls, or being well off enough to be able to service 125K on disposable income?

I did a 2min research and learned that it was created by a developer named Gavin Andresen.

cryptocurrency,Aug,1emm0vg,SEC vs Ripple case ends: Ripple must pay 125 million dollars,"Judge Torres has made her final ruling in the SEC vs Ripple case, with a judgement that Ripple must pay fines/ penalties of just over 125 million dollars.

Before starting, I ask for your respect since my mental health is in a really volatile state.  What I hope to achieve with this post is to move on, clarify what happened (as far as I understood) and also be an example for other people so everybody can learn about this traumatic event.  # Who is Kirtash93?  As you may or not know, I have been contributing to a wide range of Reddit Crypto Communities like r/cryptocurrency, r/ethtrader, r/coneheads, etc. for a long time. Some of them since 2021 and others since 2023. During that time, I achieved to accumulate 149,743.212 MOON and 604,761 DONUT. Recently I started a journey as Reddit Community Avatars artist creating my own NFT avatars for Reddit Shop.  # 10/08/2024: Preamble  That Saturday, a Telegram account with special membership contacted me and started talking about my NFTs, etc. After some chat he talked me about a project he was working on and telling me that they were recruiting NFT creators. I was quite hesitant during that time but I dont know why on Sunday I decided to change my mind and try it. To know how kind of art I needed to create he suggested me to download the game and play it a bit.  This was the game **(DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT)**  https://preview.redd.it/9rcxunj2fkjd1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d79db103bf8281af654ceba112f110c27bba88be  # 12/08/2024:The Beginning of my Worst Nightmare  That Monday I decided to wake up and start looking into this because I was on my real life job vacations for a week. So I decided to download the application, I got zero warnings from my Windows Defender and decided to install it.  During the installation which didn't took so long I noticed something was off due to a different layer colors or something so I quickly decided to uninstall it and check my computer with Malwarebytes which detected that the file was a Trojan. I quickly sent it to quarantine and removed it. After deleting the Trojan I decided to wipe all my computer.  **Hell**  Just  in that moment, I saw a notification in my phone that my Coinbase wallet SOL was moved. In this moment anxiety went to the roof, I couldn't almost think or breathe but I managed to keep trying as fast as I could and my laptop could. I was literally freaking out.

After I collected all this information and still with panic attacks and in shock I decided to go to the police to fill a complaint about what happened so they can investigate it deeper.  In parallel to this process, I tried to recover my Google account with all the 2FA existing methods but it was impossible due to a really bad Google Customer Support (non existent) and because the hacker achieved to make Google believe that he was me. I contacted also multiple customers supports, all of them better than Google ones and I have been slowly recovering all my accounts (It took a week... and still waiting for some).  # 13/08/2024: Second police complaint  I filled another complaint in another type of police with the same information.  **Advice:** When filling a complaint, write everything that happened in a file or paper with as much as details and crypto terms as possible because the person that will attend you will know shit about fuck and it will be hard to fill a good report that the specialist will understand easier.  # 13/08/2024 -16/08/2024: Accounts recoveries and security increase  First of all, I have to say that I use Bitwarden as password manager and I believe he didn't got access to it. However I decided to reset everything from scratch and start using those unique generated passwords.  During this week, I have been recovering my accounts everywhere (a pain in the ass to demonstrate that the account belongs to you) and refreshing my password security measures.  Furthermore, I decided to use only crypto in my not personal laptop that will only have access to Internet when I really need it.  # 16/08/2024 - Cockroaches Everywhere  Some of you will think that after losing a lot and being hacked life will give you a break, well, you are wrong.  Some days after I got hacked a good exRedditor zoomer made and shared an analysis about the hack in Twitter. You can read it here (https://x.com/ZoomerXBT/status/1823438152394055994), I really suggest you to do it.  Well, after that post and saying it was me some accounts, suggested me to contact a crypto recovery expert. At that moment I was bored so I decided to play along. Well as you can imagine in less than 30 minutes they recovered all my coins /S  Anyway, something funny I noticed during that joke and make them lose time process is that even thought I was 100% sure that they were trying to scam me, my brain was intrusively sending me thoughts about ""What if you dont know enough about crypto and they can?"". Crazy right? Well, just a hint. If they could, whole crypto would worth 0 xD  # Personal Opinions and Feelings  **Hack**  Regarding the hack, as you may imagine, I have been trying to understand everything but I still dont know how he managed to get each of the passwords because my wallets app were closed. Those passwords had a pattern but they were different so somehow he managed to get one and deducted the rest. I still don't know how because as far as I know I didn't have any of them saved in the browser or in the computer. Big mystery that I will never know and that I am trying to not think about for my own mental health.  **Feelings**  I don't know from where start. I cant barely remember the hack day and the following days. I have been in a roller coaster of emotions that I wouldn't wish even to my worst enemy. I tried to analyze multiple times my own feelings, why and categorize them and this is what I take in clear from it:  * **Insecurity and fear:** After losing my Google account, crypto, etc. I feel insanely insecure and with a lot of fear. Whatever delayed email notification about configuration changes triggers my anxiety to the roof. * **FOMO:** I feel that I have lost my one in a life time opportunity that I had in my own hands, so close, but now so far. My brain still sends me signals to degen into it, this is where FOMO comes in. * **Zombie:** The whole week I have been feeling like a zombie, wondering, trying to find out what to do next. Still trying to find out my next roadmap but already being built. * **\[Insert whatever bad feeling comes to your mind\]**  Regarding my current state, well, I have developed some sort of PTSD that I am working on and will work with my psychologist. Now I am stable most of the times but I suddenly cry with no apparent reason and also sometimes some words or things triggers my feelings regarding the hack too. Can't say much, first time experiencing something that is pushing me out of my known limits.  **Advice**  * Use a password manager like Bitwarden and use one different password per site. * Dont use the Sign in with Google feature in some sites. Depending how they are developed you will have no way to recover that account because you have no access due to no password. * Enable every 2FA measures as possible. * Have emails for everything. Some only for CEXs, others for social, other for shops, etc. I also suggest having a recovery Google account for example that will only get recovery emails and also be linked to other Google Drive for example. I say this because I have lost some important data but if you share all those files with other account you still have access and download it in case someone really steals your Google account. * Configure a device for only crypto use and never use crypto in your personal devices. Maybe only with another layer of hot wallets. * Ask for help, before it is too late.  # Acknowledgments  I have to thank all those people who have helped me both to gather information and to try to encourage me. We all know that words can't help and fix much but just the gesture of checking on someone if he is doing fine after a really traumatic event can really help. Every ""penny"" counts right?

I've been in the crypto space for years, starting as a Bitcoin maximalist during the Ethereum ICO when I was still a student. Now, I'm all in on Ethereum.  Over the past few years, I've made what I'd call life-changing money - about $2.3 million. That's an insane amount compared to the average salary in my country. Currently, 99% of it is still in crypto, specifically ETH.  Here's my issue: Despite this wealth, I've been living a stressful, penny-pinching life because I'm so focused on delayed gratification. I seriously struggle to spend anything over $100 without thinking, ""If I invest this instead, it could double in a few years."" This mindset is especially strong given the current high inflation.  Recently, I've been considering buying a house that would significantly improve my quality of life. It costs around $700k. Since I don't have a regular job, this means I'd need to sell some of my crypto. I've been waiting for the ""next bull run"" so ETH can get back to its all-time high before buying.  When the Bitcoin ETF happened and BTC surpassed its all-time high, I thought Ethereum would follow suit. But that hasn't happened, and now I'm back to waiting for the next catalyst. Some say it'll come by the end of the year, others think it might take several years.

Kaspa will overtake it in time and do everything it does for a much lower price with more security. Bitcoin is a safer long-term solution because it is considered a store of value by a lot of people, whereas Eth's value is based on its utility, and it will plummet when it gets usurped.  It feels like there is some balance between spending your gains and keeping them to grow. Whatever you choose, if you keep choose to keep them, please don't keep them in Eth.  Is it possible you can buy a cheaper house for the interim? That way you can keep your savings in crypto (not Eth please). You'll have a decent place to live while the rest accumulates?  Also, in normal countries trading one crypto for another will incur capital gains tax. Not sure if yours does.  Honestly for me personally it depends how old you are, and what your target is. I would take a small amount out to live comfortably and put the rest in Kaspa personally.

cryptocurrency,Aug,1eqjzka,10 things they don't want people to know or post about about Solana,"1. Bots constantly extract and **front-run users that have slippage.**   2. Transactions fail if you don't have enough slippage, and **users still have to pay for the failures.**   3. The blockchain has at least **12 major outages so far.**   4. Companies that run RPC endpoints can front-run you.   5. Solana has been **officially in beta 4.5 years so far.**   6. To become a **validator** you **need to be extremely wealthy.**   7. Their **TPS is marketed wrong**, it's not 3000 TPS, they include voting and failed transactions in this marketing to fool you, **it's actually about \~250 TPS.**   8. Solana **circulating supply increased by 59.09 million** over the last year which means **they printed $8.5 billion.**   9. Recently there was **a vote passed for validators (the rich) to get 100% of high priority transactions.**   10. **$7.5 billion SOL, is continued to be sold-off by FTX, a major unlock occurs in March 2025, and continued unlocks every month up till 2028.**  TL;DR: I added a comedy flair for ""comedy"" purposes because if someone told you that this is one of the major crypto networks you'd indeed think that crypto is a scam...  Source: Dave on X","1. Front-running is a common issue on many chains, not just Solana. [There are improvements being worked on](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-mev-an-introduction#reducing-the-mev-surface-area), but mostly you can mitigate this just by setting slippage low. I'd be curious to see the numbers, but clearly OP did not feel like including any actual data sources. Here is what I found for Ethereum: https://eigenphi.io/mev/ethereum/sandwich  2. [Most users do not deal with many failed transactions, 8% is the theorized failure rate for normal users](https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1781148253284929589) (a user manual transacting) and includes user error, like setting slippage to tight or trying to interact with an invalid contract. Additionally paying for a failed transaction would be a negligible amount. [The average fee in general on Solana is 0.000005855983167446366 which is 2 cents, the median fee is 0.000005855983167446366 which would be a tiny fraction of a penny.](https://dune.com/queries/3783516) Even a real user making 5000 transactions a year, failing at the expected rate(400 failures), would only spend 8 dollars on failed txns using the average, and using the median fee it would be only **34 cents**.   3. 4 hours in Feb 24, 19 hours in Feb 23, 8 hours in Sep 23 (overnight to Oct 1st), 4 hours Jun 22, 8 hours in Apr 22 (overnight to May 1st), 17 hours in Sep 21. That is every ""Major Outage"" from https://status.solana.com/uptime . That equals  60 hours since mainnet launched in March 2020, so that averages to an uptime of **99.9984%**. (60 hours = 3600 minutes -&gt; 3600/(53 months worth of hours of uptime)= .00155% downtime / 99.9984% uptime). Also keep in mind that downtime has become far more infrequent recently with only 4 hours over the last year, which would be **99.9995%**  4. I can't tell if this is just a rehash of point 1 or if they think this is an actual issue or if they conflated something else. Never heard of any RPC endpoints frontrunning, in fact it's generally the opposite, RPC endpoints that save you from front-running. It was briefly reference in the first link about MEV: https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-mev-an-introduction#reducing-the-mev-surface-area  5. ok? It's a label that is arbitrary to most people because it only really applies to the software aspect and plenty of things in crypto that haven't been labeled beta have been far more beta-like. This reads more like a ""Did You Know?"" than a FUD piece, maybe Dave should sell some of his ADA for an editor and he could avoid this in future FUD tweets.  6. Not really. You need a decent chunk of money especially for the SOL itself but [Solana has had no trouble getting a globally distributed and decentralized validator set](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/63857484f91d71181b02f971/d7405223-b2b7-4790-8356-e80636e1b5f9/image5.png?format=2500w). Hardware requirements are coming down as the software gets optimized. Being a block-producing validator is likely not going to be a realistic proposition for most individuals whether it be on Solana or Ethereum, most chains are trending towards scaling with centralized block production and decentralized data validation.  7. You could easily check this on any of the wonderful Solana explorers to see they were lying. This was by far the easiest lie of the post to fact check, because if you know crypto at all, you should know how to find this on any chain and it's available straight from the chain in a multitude of places. There are no good excuses for believing this bit of FUD, you're either a typical /r/cryptocurrency subscriber who took it hook, line, and sinker, or you know it's false and are knowingly spreading a lie. Current TPS is around 700, which is quite nice.   8. That's literally just the inflation rate and some minor unlocks, which is publicly available information. Maybe this is shocking to some very uninformed people who don't realize that every blockchain is paying millions for economic security. Inflation is constantly lowering until it hits 1.5% and most unlocks are done. https://messari.io/project/solana/charts/supply https://solanacompass.com/tokenomics  9. This was done because their was misaligned incentives and unsurprisingly it's far less cut and dry than you suggest here. In fact much of the support behind it was because it actually helped smaller validators. Feel free to read the discussion here: https://forum.solana.com/t/proposal-for-enabling-the-reward-full-priority-fee-to-validator-on-solana-mainnet-beta/1456  10.

While you are playing, the game states will be streamed into a Hydra head, which uses Cardano smart contracts to validate the game transition for every frame, in real time. It’s a passion project put together by a small team, including Sundae Labs, Adam Dean, and a few folks from IOG, in a short amount of time. All the code is fully open sourced.      Hydra Doom is intended as a light-hearted tech demo and is not a commercial product.

cryptocurrency,Aug,1embjmc,"Kraken restricted my account, request to see ALL my bank transactions","Over one week ago, on **July 29**, Kraken restricted my account. The only things I can still do is earn (from staking) and withdrawing.  A little info what is going on: I am a german customer, and they requested me to do another KYC months ago. I didn't hesitate and did it in time, and they also received it in time.  For months, nothing happened, no one even replied to me, I didn't get any update about it. And then, when the first deadline was met, my account got restricted. I reached out to them, and it turned out they didn't accept my proof of income. It was a bank statement, just as listed [here](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000383383-What-is-proof-of-sources-of-funds-POSOF-) as a valid proof. But it didn't include my address, which wasn't mentioned anywhere.  https://preview.redd.it/my1fpoxel8hd1.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc1f1f4f23506f310b4d2588e4b7d5865aa34e5d  Well, okay. I checked my bank and I saw there is no option to get a statement for a single transaction that includes my address. Also none other proof I could provide does this by the way, not even my employment contract. The only thing that does, is my full monthly bank statement, this documents is 8 pages long for last month and includes all my private transactions of that time. Literally everything I bought with fiat, even over services like Paypal.  So I censored all private transactions except the income, which should be pretty reasonable. I obviously didn't touch any relevant information about my person (like address, bank account number, and so on)  On **July 31**, this was the response I got:  https://preview.redd.it/1e8zyo78l8hd1.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63030a5efdd5beb4a72f6adad1d0af695dbdd98c  I contacted support and explained them how I have no single statement for the income which includes the full name and address. They were very understanding and promised me to escalate the case and quickly take care of it. **No new document was requested from me. No one was able to tell me what I could do to resolve the issue otherwise.**     Today, **August 7** (one week later), still no response. I contacted support again, and this is what I was told:    https://preview.redd.it/8k1pvm7om8hd1.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=409111207fef199db8ab14aa1b69430319b026cf  So yes, Kraken wants to see all my bank transactions and save them on their servers to reverify my account. This is freaking insane, and there is no way I will do something like this.  After a long conversation, I was allowed to talk to  a supervisor and someone from the onboarding team. Again, they were very understanding. They promised again someone would look into it again after I explained them the situation again.    **A few hours later, I got a support email urging me to reverify my account. If I click the link, it says the process is pending. I kinda feel like this is a joke by now.**    The next deadline is **August 19**, and if I don't reverify until then, they will suspend withdrawals. Yes, they threaten to steal my remaining funds if **they** don't verify my account in time. So either I have to get the fuck out, or show them all my private transactions.       Kraken used to have the best support of all crypto exchanges. And now, they are below average. Far below. Their support documents are incomplete, they don't communicate ongoing issues in time, they rather restrict accounts out of nowhere. Their support agents have no idea what a customer has to provide, and they can't make any clear statements what I can do to resolve the issue.

And before people jump in and say ""bLaMe yOuR gOvRrnMeNt"" : I opened a stock broker account a few months ago.

Especially influencers always try to come up with an explanations about the market moves. They need to validate themselves in the eyes of their followers. They are wrong about their predictions most of the time but will always advertise a few of their alpha calls on twitter, telegram groups etc. Crypto's total mcap is too low compared to other markets and price actions are too volatile to be able to make healthy assumptions in short terms.  You've heard the popular phrase about crypto: never invest more than you are ok to lose. It is correct. Anything can happen in the blink of an eye. So only thing you can do is to have a strategy and goal about your investment. If you've hit your goal, or feel bearish, just leave the market asap. If you are bullish yeah it is time to accumulate more and hold. Up or down, both way is possible. At the end we all just make a bet. However there are good strategies to manage your positions, for example it is possible to dca out or dca in.  OR  You can open margin trade positions with high leverage and wait for market makers to decide it is time to liquidate your position.  Stay safe.","The market is red because I bought.

With liquidity thinning out and the lack of any immediate bullish catalysts like ETF approvals or central bank dovishness, the big players saw an opportunity to trigger a cascading sell-off, effectively shaking out weak hands.  Additionally, there was a notable absence of fresh retail inflows, leaving most of the market momentum to be dictated by institutional traders who were already sitting on significant profits. The lack of new bullish news—no imminent halvening, no unexpected interest rate cuts from the Fed—meant that the sentiment shifted to bearish, pushing whales to unload their bags and lock in gains before the next potential accumulation phase.  In short, with most of the bullish news priced in and no further upward catalysts on the horizon, the whales found it an opportune moment to orchestrate a dump, resetting the market for another potential cycle. The sudden surge in selling pressure caught many overleveraged traders off guard, leading to widespread liquidations and further downward pressure.

Traditional financial markets were willing to play along in 2023 and 2024 because corporate profits were holding in there (some even booming from AI) and the consumer and labor markets were still strong (in USA at least) and thus credit spreads were well contained.   Well times have changed and the financial markets are telling the Fed they are woefully behind the curve. The consumer is strapped and lots of people think AI is a bubble (not me but thats besides the point) Perhaps markets are overreacting to 1 bad (not horrible) Non Farm Payrolls job report but the confluence of signals from the low end consumer, to more recent spike in VIX and credit spreads is leading to a contagion.

BTC is not a peer to peer currency. And forcing it on people is a bad idea.,"It takes more than years, it takes some actual incentive to adopt it. Crypto still has way too many downsides compared to credit cards or cash for it to see any real use as a currency as opposed to a speculative asset.  Just to name a few:  * Higher transaction fees * Volatile value compared to anything but the most hyper-inflating currencies * Requires a stable internet connection and specialized software to use * Prone to scams, digital theft, etc compared to credit cards and bank accounts  Even in places with some limited adoption, like El Salvador or Venezuela, it's mostly used for its ability to immediately convert into USD, which is far more stable to hold, and more valued by society at large.","Everyone should have knows that this won't be too easy, especially in a country where many people do not prioritize digital advancements.  So not bad in any way for Crypto that this is taking long. Let's just hope he educates the people properly for Bitcoin instead of rushing it.","&gt; The average credit card fee is 1.5%-3.5% (source: Nerdwallet).  This is almost always eaten by the merchant as a cost of doing business and in exchange for the fraud protection provided by credit cards. The few cases where there is a price difference compared to paying with cash are almost always things where paying with a bank transfer is safe and incurrs no fee, such as payments to government, rent, and utilities.  &gt; If you look at the vast majority of the top 100 cryptos, you have far more options that are cheaper than that, many that even offer fractions of a penny to near $0 transactions.  Which only benefits the business side of the payment equation. The problem for businesses then is that in the time between accepting the Crypto and converting it into actual money they can pay taxes and employees with the price can change and errase the tiny benefit Crypto might provide. While it's possible for the price to increase as well, this isn't enough to cancel out the potential for a substantial drop to put the business itself at risk if a substantial portion of payments were made in Crypto.  Crypto also introduces potential additional tax liabilities, depending on how it's treated in the relevant tax jurisdiction (and in the best case it's still going to eat some of your potential gains from price increases between payment and sale).  &gt; You also need an internet connection and merchant software to use a credit card. And it's much more convoluted and expensive, and typically less secure, compared to crypto.  Fun fact, you actually don't, it *is* possible to take credit card payments without an active connection to the internet. Search ""Offline credit card processing"" for more information.  Also as noted above it's not actually more expensive for the consumer, and the risk for the business from price fluctuations and potential tax liabilities makes the small savings they could realize through Crypto not worthwhile. Especially when the most common way of accepting Crypto while getting around these issues involved a third party service which charges a fee...  &gt; There's actually far more credit card and banking scams and theft...by a very large margin. It's not even in the same league. Look at the numbers. But to be fair, there's also far more credit card use.  The key point for the consumer is that credit cards, at least in every developed nation I'm aware of the policies or laws for, are protected from fraud. In the US the maximum fraud liability for the card holder is capped at $50 by law, and frequently the card issuers reduce it to $0.  Also scams or hacking targetting bank accounts directly is far less common than credit card fraud. This is because bank transactions are closely monitored, and it's fairly easy for modern banks to stop suspicious transactions before they can be completed. There's also generally a waiting period where the transaction can still be rolled back by the sending bank.  Scams can still affect all of these cases, but again Credit Cards provide the potential for a charge back, where as with Crypto there is no hope of getting your funds back once they've been sent."

The more advanced move (if you have access to lobbyists and both parties on Capitol Hill send you Christmas cards) would be to pump up the value of bitcoin, and then change the laws that regulate how you can use bitcoin- such as:  * Adding a huge tax to anyone cashing out their Bitcoin, with legal penalties for evading the tax. This lets them scare people into keeping their money locked up in the value of Bitcoin, while the banks develop ways to use that value without actually selling the coin.   * Letting certified institutions (i.e. investment banks and not any of the lowly “retail investors”) use Bitcoin as part of complex financial instruments. Instead of garbage coins, they’ll make garbage financial bonds backed by cryptocurrency values that look legitimate unless they implode- it’ll be the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis all over again.  * Creating tax breaks for the service fees associated with Bitcoin transactions, provided the claimant adheres to KYC laws designed to eliminate anonymity. For major companies, a higher value in bitcoin would allow them generate tax credits practically at whim- with other people’s money doing the work for them.  Cryptocurrency was meant to get away from the shady practices of banks and governments. When an institution like Blackrock is buying Bitcoin, it’s like Fox buying a starter kit for a chicken farm.",This seems spot on.,need a confirmation cramer,BTC is ready to replace gold.

Followed by the second.    Replaced by other predictions.  I suppose if you make enough one might be right by chance.  I feel like the problem with using past data is that the past shows overwhelming upward trends from a time when there was a gold rush.  No model trained on this will consider that the price could actually go down.  The market will change when bitcoin is supporting millions of retirees all selling 1000s a month to live on.  We just haven't seen that dynamic before so past data is useless.  When someone who bought 100s a month becomes someone who sells for 1000s a month it's a big swing.  It's one less buyer and a seller wanting to pull out at 10x the rate he put in.    How does the model factor that in?    You have to have a rate of new bitcoin buyers.  A rate of retirement.  How much can the buyers afford?  How much will the sellers need to sell each month once they retire.  How many will exit in a big bang (Lambo!).  How much will a work be able to put aside for bitcoin in the future?  Probably less than us (due to rising cost of living , energy, rent, food) which compounds the issue further.  That's what you actually need to model.  But no one does.    For one obvious reason....    You can quickly see that it only needs a small percentage , eg  &lt;10% of buyers, wanting 10x out what remaining buyers can afford to put in for the market dynamic to be put under a completely different sort of pressure.  If you modelled this, you won't like the results.    The lack of any real world model that considers buyers, sellers and their activities is very amateurish.

This decrease in fees followed the Dencun upgrade, which introduced blobs and proto-danksharding technology, enhancing layer-2 (L2) network capabilities and reducing congestion on Ethereum's main layer. The lower fees have incentivized increased use of Ethereum, marking a bullish development for the blockchain and decentralized finance. Additionally, the introduction of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has attracted Wall Street's attention, with over $2 billion traded in spot Ether ETFs by the end of August.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

cryptocurrency,Sep,1fhe8i1,There is no 1.4 trillion dollar stimulus headed to bitcoin from China.,"So, let's use a bit of common sense as we move into this topic. A speculative Forbes article says, ""Maybe china is going to give its people 1000 USD each to go out and spend to get the economy moving again.""                 Okay. Let's break that down. 1000 USD / Person in China. Do you know how difficult it is to put that money into bitcoin if you live anywhere besides Hong Kong?                 Not to sound like a psy-op or a puppet from a foreign state, but it's necessary to name some reminders about China and digital assets:               1. Ownership is prohibited.                   2. Manufacturing of mining devices (ASICs) is prohibited (bitmain makes them in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia).               3. Mining is illegal.                   4. Using any payment method (wechat pay, alipay, bank transfer, etc.) to buy crypto is illegal.                     Now, the above points will not stop everyone from buying crypto in China, but even before ""crypto-prohibition"" in China became a thing in 2021, crypto-ownership in China was lower per capita than America or Europe. A sober perspective is to say that maybe a billion or two USD will enter the crypto markets, largely through OTC trades - which are still very punishable and can get anyone's wechatpay / bank / alipay accounts suspended or restricted.                 So, in other words, at best, a few drops in the bucket will enter the market.",China doesn’t give stimmy to consumers. It gives it to producers to lower the cost of their production. The whole premise is thru an American understanding that doesn’t exist in China,"Not to mention, even if it were easy and legal for everyone in China to use their $1000 stimulus money to buy Bitcoin, how many would actually do that?

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:  https://preview.redd.it/iszaq0tqy5od1.png?width=187&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1735863b0ea81a2609df6809c57a7108372a332  # 2024 Top Ten Portfolio vs. The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)  The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market, similar to the “lazy” approach of the Bogleheads in traditional markets.*** Much has changed over the last 6.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2024)).  Like last year, I’m running a friendly competition between The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio and [The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https://amkt.com/) (**AMKT**).  **AMKT** is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of 15 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index and completely onchain.  Similar to the Boglehead Community, a Do Nothing Club has emerged encouraging a long-term “lazy” crypto investing approach.  Since the index represents approximately 95% of the value within crypto, **AMKT** is an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.    Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***  On 1 January 2024, $1000 was equal to 7.2 AMKT.  Eight  months into the Experiment, here’s the **AMKT** snapshot:   https://preview.redd.it/izxh5m8ty5od1.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92574fcc54b7e91ba146701d6051e0fee13e135a  **August Performances:**  * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio**: -14%  * **AMKT**: -18%.  The August monthly victory goes to: **The 2024 Top Ten Crypto Experiment**  **Overall since January 1st, 2024:**   * **The 2024 Top Ten Portfolio:** -5% *  **AMKT:** +7%  Overall lead: **The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token (AMKT)**.  For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **AMKT** competition this year:  https://preview.redd.it/d5s7z05vy5od1.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74ac9fd14c951946a6d997896c0e4cf452d0ee97  # Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios   So, where do we stand if we combine seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?  * [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-78): down -7% (total value $927) * [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-67): up +400% (total value $5,001) * [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-56): up +617% (total value $7,172) (***best performing portfolio****)* * [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-39): up +165% (total value $2,650) * [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-28): down -51% (total value $488) (***worst performing portfolio****)* * [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +54% (total value $1,539) * [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up -5% (total value $946)  Taking the seven portfolios together:  **After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$18,722**  **That’s up +167%** on the combined portfolio, the lowest level since [January 2024](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:  https://preview.redd.it/cjb73jbxy5od1.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddbadf0addedbe13bc3aca8c409a0b8105184dd5  In summary: ***That’s a +167% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.  # Comparison to S&amp;P 500  I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.  https://preview.redd.it/j66ublz2z5od1.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9c24e32ff2b61320982158a863acd6480eebb94  The S&amp;P 500 is up +18% so far in 2024, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,180 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.  Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:  * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,110 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,250 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,750 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,500 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,190 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,470 today * $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,180 today  Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:   **After seven $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $11,460.**  That is up **+64%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+167%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.    The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:   https://preview.redd.it/wb9vc2a4z5od1.png?width=1370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8086a62642ba07b5504e3c8d71e34a62d8fd8b8e  # Conclusion:  To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long.

Now I keep one in every year to allow for an honest/accurate comparison between the portfolios, or at least that is the intent. I certainly didn't foresee the rise of stablecoins, I thought it was a feature of the deep bear we were in. In retrospect, yeah, I wish I didn't include stables.

The ICO era was the worst managed era in US crypto history, and that entirely falls on Trumps team. America was not ready for the 2018 boom, and basically threatened to kill crypto if it could. They tried to declare that, not just every ICO was a security, but mining is a dividend yield and therefore Bitcoin/Litecoin/Dogecoin were securities as well. They just generalized the entire industry, demonized it, and acted like we were all criminals.  The savings grace of that era was that it was all bark, no bite. They destroyed the entrepreneurial side of US web3 at the time, but when there threats were seen as hollow, it did come back. But it was a scary, terribly managed time.  No administration has been nice to crypto, but let's not pretend like Bidens team was worse than Trumps team, or that Obamas was necessarily nicer than Trumps either. When Obama was in charge, it was small enough to ignore, so it's hard to judge. When Trump was in charge, it was ballooning and they wayyy over-corrected with their knee-jerk reaction, and with Biden in charge, it's been a bunch of legal battles that were handled terribly, but at least they were picking on a few projects at a time to set their precedent rather than try to ban the entire industry like they threatened under Trump.  Now, what matters who would be in charge moving forward. Are Biden and Kamala actually the same, or are you just assuming that?  If we go from advisors, you are half-right and half-wrong. Biden had 1 pro-crypto advisor representing the camp, a Ripple board member. Kamala has two, she is also bringing him on, but also a Binance board member. By comparison, Trump has no pro-crypto advisors, and has cited his son as who would be guiding him when asked.   From a SEC standpoint, she may or may not differ. It's too early to know if she's going to appoint someone new or not. The rumour mill is yes, there are three people her team is debating on replacing Gensler with, with Chris Brummer leading the rumour mill. However, we won't know the answer to that just yet."

No chance.” … “It doesn’t appeal to business customers because it doesn’t have a keyboard, which makes it not a very good email machine.” — Steve Ballmer  Stylometry shows that they are the same person. In 2007, he pointed out that the lack of a keyboard was a flaw (which was actually the main innovation). Then in 2010, he argued that using energy to prove work (mining Bitcoin) was another flaw (but it turned out to be one of the century’s main inventions).   The irony is hard to miss. In 2007, Steve Ballmer saw the iPhone’s lack of a keyboard as a fatal flaw. He couldn’t fathom that people might actually enjoy tapping on a screen, as if millions were yearning for the click-clack of Blackberry keys. Yet, what he dismissed as a glaring oversight turned out to be the main attraction—the touchscreen was the revolution, not just a quirky alternative. The world was ready to trade cramped keyboards for swipe and pinch, while Ballmer was left clutching his stylus.  Fast forward to 2010, and “TimeAwayFromHome” (apparently Ballmer’s online persona) was back with another hot take: Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining process was a pointless waste. To be fair, it was a bold stance—criticizing a brand-new technology that most people hadn’t even heard of yet. It’s almost as if he believed that using energy to secure a global, decentralized, tamper-proof currency was a silly inconvenience, as though millions were waiting for Bitcoin to apologize and start running on goodwill alone.  Of course, in both cases, these “flaws” turned out to be defining features. The touchscreen became the blueprint for modern smartphones, and proof-of-work mining created the foundation for the most significant shift in finance since the invention of the credit card. What seemed like design blunders were actually strokes of genius, missed entirely by the same person, twice. It’s almost as if the tech world should start paying attention to whatever Ballmer dislikes—it might just be the next big thing.",yeah but no way you would have held until today,"I was around back then too.

I see it everyday with people buying up shitcoins and everyone in those ""communities"" claiming they're all going to go 4x their previous ATH ""once the bullbrun starts.""  News flash. This is the bullrun. Previously, people would take BTC profits and pump up larger cap alts, take those profits and go to small caps and finally micro caps. More people are holding onto their BTC. Look at the charts, theres far fewer flash crashes. All metrics suggest this including BTC in cold storage and more inactive wallets than ever. This BTC progression in previous cycles saw the alt coin market going nuts. At this point, You could do a 4x on any random binance pair. The fomo was crazy. There's none of that now. Just bleeding alts to BTC.  Furthermore, people are skipping out on the larger cap speculation for the meme coin defi market.

I don't care how many transactions it can do or the speed of finality or what company is rumored to have plans to use it. Its the same meme coin hype shit, just a smaller scale.  Yes, some projects will pump in the next year. Yes, some projects are genuinely good with great developers making amazing tech. But most of the alts you're buying and holding with the expectation of past price action will not return to ATHs. Price aside, whatever goals on your teams roadmap mean fuck all. There's not that many problems a speculative token fueled blockchain can fix that some traditional network can't do better, faster and cheaper. No major publicly sold company cares about how decentralized something is.  Downvote me all you want. I know you really care about whatever ETH killer youve been stacking and holding. Some of you will get lucky and I hope you do. But for most, its not happening.  The reason why meme coins are so popular is because it's the streamlined, super fast paced version of the entire crypto market. It's the final format.

cryptocurrency,Oct,1fwztvv,"Spent $1600 and 2 months doing CopyTrading, these are the results:","Hey everyone!  So a couple months ago I had some money laying around and I decided I wanted to try new things to see if I could earn some extra bucks. As background, I knew I could risk this money since I have a good joob and I didn't need it to survive, and I like crypto (bad combination some would say).  That's when I remembered Binance has this feature where you can copy trade people and share the profits. So I bought some USDT and sent it to my Binance account to get started.    # Initial Strategy  I have some experience with trading, but nothing too crazy. And I'm very familiar with the crypto world, I joined in 2019. But despite that, I never tried copy trading in general, let alone using Binance platform, so I wasn't really sure of what strategy to follow.  After some thought, I decided I didn't want to put all the eggs in a single basket, and decided I wanted to ""test"" the traders before giving them more money. Especially because I was going to use futures instead of spot trading.  I started testing the traders with an initial balance of 50 USDT, and I'd increase it on a monthly basis depending on their results.  I didn't know what to expect, so I chose the traders mainly on PnL/ROI, but that was pretty much it.    # First revisions  As you may expect already, choosing traders based on PnL/ROI was kind of a mistake. Some of the traders were super aggressive and used high amounts of leverage (one of them was using x125 lol), meaning that they were getting crazy returns when they won, but also losing pretty much everything when they lost.  After the first month I realized this and started searching for traders that matched a specific criteria, traders must have the following:  * Decent amount of days in the platform (+100 ideally) * Low amount of previosuly closed wallets (less than 3 ideally) * Decent returns but not crazy in the last 90 days (10/-50% range) * Steady PnL/ROI chart upwards * Low MDD (around 20% max) * Decent sharpe ratio  As you can see, I became more selective with the traders that I choose (and I will probably continue adjusting this based on the results), and I stopped expecting quick crazy returns.    # Results  In total I copied 20 different traders and as a way to share the results, I created a spreadsheet where you can better visualize the results that I got divided by each trader:  https://preview.redd.it/92p6w4pxvzsd1.jpg?width=985&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9fe6bd569ed0f56b4912c66d57c0a52fe3c85c8  *NOTE: PnL for traders currently open include PnL for open positions, and does not include profit sharing (usually 10%).*  As you can see, most of the traders that I started copying during first month are now closed. Main reason is that I didn't like their strategy/risk management and I didn't feel comfortable copying them, or they directly lost everything.  Luckily, second batch of traders I chose using the adjusted strategy seem to be doing good. But it's still early to jump into conclusions since I started copying them less than a month ago. I wait at least a month before deciding to give them more capital as I mentioned before.    # Final Numbers  In order to better visualize the results, I created this simple summary:  https://preview.redd.it/wp3ktlbexzsd1.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6100b5e625863349cdc2348da3d97407058d36e  As you can see, despite all the loses, I still managed to earn 129USDT, close to 8% return in 2 months. Mainly thanks to a single trader that I deployed more capital to and did extremely good. 🙏    # Conclusions &amp; How to continue  I think that the adjustment in the strategy was a good choice that will help me to reduce the risks when choosing traders to copy, so I will continue adjusting and improving it as I gather more data.  Also, since I wanted to have multiple options, I tested a ton of traders, but as I continue adjusting the strategy, I will start reducing the amount of new traders that I give an opportunity to so I can focus on giving more capital to the ones that I already have and that are doing good.  The idea is to stabilize the returns by having different traders with different strategies (but always inside a certain range) and start to slowly deploy more capital so I can increase the $$ returns.    # Thank you!

cryptocurrency,Oct,1g2wgko,There is a new SCAM method you should be wary of,"Someone in a Telegram group for a token I currently hold contacted me and asked how to launch a token on the blockchain, along with a few other questions. After some back and forth, he offered to pay me upfront for my help.  At this point, I was certain he was a scammer, but I was curious about how he planned to scam me if he was offering to send money first. So, I decided to continue the conversation casually.  He then explained that he couldn't send the money to my wallet address because he'd been scammed before by trusting people too quickly. Instead, he asked me to create a *new* wallet and send him the *new recovery phrase*, promising to load it with funds.  As we all know, the recovery phrase is private and should never be shared, so I confronted him directly and asked him to stop lying and explain how the scam works. Surprisingly, he was cooperative and told me the details.  It turns out that when you create a new recovery phrase on your wallet app (like Phantom, MetaMask, or others), scammers can use that phrase to access not only the new wallet but also all other wallets your have in your application, allowing them to steal your funds.  I really hope this post helps others avoid falling for scams like this.","You or they are misunderstanding something here.   One seed phrase has no connection to another seed phrase even when generated by the same wallet in consecutive order. This is just not a thing.   The scammer wants you to make a new “Wallet” not a new seed.  Then send the Seed for the new wallet which is also the seed for your other wallets.    This is a low effort, low sophistication scam","Think of how e.g. a hardware wallet or other multichain wallet, with only one seed phrase, can generate addresses for nearly every blockchain, and how it generates multiple addresses for each. The master seed can be used to derive practically unlimited internal private keys. It's a legacy feature of BIP32 originating with Bitcoin. It would be wildly impractical if this *weren't* possible.  https://river.com/learn/terms/d/derivation-path/  The scam is assuming that, rather than setting up a truly fresh address with a fresh master seed, you'll generate a new address from within your existing wallet, meaning that the new address would be derived from the same master seed as your other addresses. So it's totally avoidable in the sense that you could use a fresh master key and the scammers would have no access to your other addresses, but it exploits the easy/obvious thing most people would do.","I'd call it a ""sleigh of hand"" type of scam, simple but effective.... easily to get confused/or confuse someone by focusing attention to the wallet. A new seed phrase that you generate for the new wallet is also the new seed phrase for all wallets in your metamask.","I don't get how it is possible to use one seed phrase, a new one, for another wallet.","If someone contacts you on telegram about crypto it’s a scam, flat out done deal. No other reason. Literally zero reason to interact with anyone on telegram over crypto.",*sleight* of hand.,"I guess you can create a new wallet address, but the seed phrase will still be the same, and the scammer hopes you don’t know your seed phrase when creating a „new“ one.",They can't. The whole scam involves tricking you into handing over your seed phrase.,My mind is blown on how you can think giving away a seed phrase is a new scam method.,"I'd call it a shitty wallet UX that doesn't make it clear that new accounts use the same seed, just a different derivation path.  Even if it's understood by people who know how BIP-32/BIP-48 work, most users have no clue about this and don't memorize words that they (hopefully) backup so they don't recognize the existing seed.  A simple ""do not share your seed, it is the same as your other accounts"" warning would be the least you should do when you design a wallet. In addition to never share a seed with anyone, use multi-signature schemes if you need multiple people to own funds."

Set your expectations to smaller gains, especially if you've jumped on this in the past month or 2.  DO NOT connect your wallet to anything. If you do, make sure your wallet is empty.

Since November 2022, the country has been purchasing one Bitcoin daily at an average price below $42,000.

cryptocurrency,Nov,1h2vzcp,I hope people can see whats happening with US based cryptos and Bitcoin,"Crypto investor since 2017, made good money, enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things I want with my life. Doesnt mean I know anything.  It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%  Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.  This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.  And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.  With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.  I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 2022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.  I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.",Dude just put the fries in the bag,I agree and you're absolutely right when you say you don't know anything.,You hear about the 1-2% of people who make big gains with memecoins. You don't hear about the 95-98% of people who don't.  The more you know ✨,TLDR OP got lucky once and now thinks theyre an expert,Man people are calling HBAR and ADA and freaking ALGORAND dinosaur coins now? That shit is young as hell. The whole crypto space is barely 10-12 years old lmao. What about feathercoin and peercoin.

It was all going pretty well until May 2022. Then the LUNA implosion happened. My **UST** is now worth $2.24, down -98%.

Despite this achievement, Bitcoin's market cap remains significantly lower than gold's $17.594 trillion.

cryptocurrency,Nov,1gurjbg,"MicroStrategy buys nearly 80,000 BTC in November, outpacing US Bitcoin ETF purchases",,MicroStrategy is on mission to the Mars.,"The guy took a huge risk and not only is it paying off, it makes him look like a fucking genius in hindsight. For all the people who say, “why would you buy shares of MSTR when you can straight up buy Bitcoin,” and there are several reasons..   Certain financial instruments like 401k’s, IRAs, Retirement / Pension funds don’t make it easy for you to buy Bitcoin directly. If you opt for Bitcoin ETFs you pay management fees which compound into your gain potential.   MicroStrategy offers a unique way to amplify exposure to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin itself is the ultimate scarce asset, MSTR leverages strategies like issuing stock or convertible bonds at ultra-low interest rates (0.6-0.8%) to buy more BTC. This allows the company to effectively leverage Bitcoin’s growth potential without traditional operating expenses diluting shareholder value.  Unlike other companies that dilute shares for inventory, R&amp;D, or other costs, Microstrategy directly converts raised capital into Bitcoin, increasing its BTC holdings and enhancing its balance sheet. This creates a leveraged play on Bitcoin, offering 2-3x returns compared to Bitcoin’s direct performance, given the compounding effect of debt-financed BTC acquisition.  Also, Microstrategy’s ability to “print” shares strategically amplifies Bitcoin’s scarcity while benefiting shareholders. If MicroStrategy begins distributing dividends in BTC in the future, it would further strengthen its appeal as a stock-backed Bitcoin proxy. There’s also many other products in the works as well.   Basically, MSTR is ideal for those looking for a leveraged way to benefit from Bitcoin’s upside, with Saylor’s vision and strategy aligning to maximize BTC exposure. You get leveraged benefits of BTC, all while the buisness intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based services side of the company is still profitable itself.",Saylor so damn btc-hungry  he wants to rule the new world,I got no idea what you're talking about but I love it.,My friend bout shares of Super Micro Computer thinking it was Microstartegy.

I'm getting on in years and have seen a lot of unthinkable things happen through the decades, and boy, let me tell you... when popular opinion is that something is supposed to be ""too big to fail"" what the actual reality often ends up being is ""the bigger they are, the harder they fall"".

cryptocurrency,Dec,1hboz55,"You always hear about the guy who made $100K by betting $100. You never hear about those who risked thousands and are left with nothing. Out of 40,000+ coins analyzed over the past 10 years, only 1.7% delivered a 100x return!","Here’s the hard truth about investing:  *You always hear about the guy who made $100K by betting $100. You never hear about those who put in thousands and are left with nothing.*  All of us have at least once wished we had made a similar play to the one that [turned $17 into \~6M](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21076574/he-invested-17-in-shiba-inu-now-he-has-almost-6m)[.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/millennial-dogecoin-millionaire-on-being-paid-in-dogecoin.html) More than 2.1 million people right now are trying to find the next crypto moonshot. Even the CEO of Coinbase is touting how if someone had bought $100 Bitcoin when Coinbase was founded, it would be worth $1.5 million today.  With all that’s going on, what’s the actual probability of getting a 100x return on your investment in the crypto world?  # What are the odds that you will lose 100% of your investment?  Of the more than 40,000 coins that traded in an exchange at least once in the last 10 years, only 38% are still alive. So forget about making a profit — the probability that the coin you buy will survive over the long run is only \~ 1 in 3.  [Total number of coins: 40,399 | Source: Market Sentiment Research, CoinGecko](https://preview.redd.it/3den43lgi66e1.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f13079314237019897f6099b094b53cc56c4425d)  # What about 100’xing your investment?  While there are probably hundreds *(even thousands)* of coins that might have 100’xed in value during their brief existence *(like the Hawk Tuah coin)*, it’s unrealistic to expect to find them and invest in them before someone rug pulls them out of existence.  To get a more realistic scenario, we kept a minimum market cap limit of $10 Million and required the coin to be present in the top 100 coins based on market cap.  The backtest is simple — At the beginning of every month *(starting in 2014)*, we check what the top 100 most popular coins were and the probability that you would have 100’xed your investment if you held on to that coin *(*[data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-3jqju58bfewDd2GxfH0jd0woO2kSKYEodFYkf6JB0/edit?usp=sharing)*).*  In the last 10 years, there were a total of 9,502 coins that fit our criteria. Out of these, only 442 *(4.6%)* grew more than 100x. This assumes that you sold at the very top. If you had held on to these coins to date, the number drops to 160.  **So, over the holding period, the chance that you 100’xed your investment on a coin is only 1.7%.**  If you remove the duplicates *(as the same coin can come up in our filter in different months),* of the 460 cryptocurrencies that made it into the list, only 38 *(8%)* grew more than 100x. If you held on till 2024, only 8 coins *(1.7%)* provided you with a 100x return.  &gt;  If you are calculating the expected value and think that you will come out ahead *(given you have a \~2% chance of 100x returns)*, you must read [our research on Kelly Criterion.](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/the-problem-with-averages)  For those who are determined to try to win, here are a few things to consider:  1. **Be aware of the odds** — The chance of you hitting a 100x return on your meme coin investment is less than 1 in 50. To put this in perspective, it’s like picking a specific card out of a shuffled deck of cards on your first try! 2. **Spread your bets —** The best way to improve your odds of winning is to survive. You can reduce your risk and improve your returns by [diversifying and making smart bet sizes.](https://www.marketsentiment.co/p/shannons-demon)",1.7% delivering 100x returns is actually a lot higher than I would’ve expected,"It is guaranteed win, not bad.","TBH 1.7% chance of a 100x is still profitable.  That's how casino odds work, betting on red is 50% chance, x2s your money.   Betting on a row is 33% chance -&gt; x3  In that analogy, something with a 1% chance gives 100x  Conclusion, crypto gives better odds than a casino, with a 1.7% to 100x  Conclusion 2 : your warning is only making me want to bet even more",So youre telling me theres a chance,"If the numbers here can be taken at face value, it suggests that if you split your investment across a large number of different coins, then you can expect an almost guaranteed positive ROI.  If you could, hypothetically, invest $1 each in 1000 coins, spending $1000, and you could expect to later sell 17 of those coins (1.7%) for $100, then you will have made back $1700. That's a gain of $700. This plus whatever you'd get from selling all the other coins that didn't make it to x100.  These numbers probably shouldn't be taken at face value, though. I think this seems much too good to be true.","You need to tell me the chances of doing 5x or 10x too.   1.7% of doing 100x even with 98.3% of losing it all, makes the investment worth it, +70% expected returns.

For pretty much the entire existence of crypto so far, US users have had to self report crypto gains on their taxes (many didn't, or simply underreport).

Especially noteworthy: If you have coins that you've held for a long time (e.g. from this year or before) and you sell them next year, the IRS will see that you have **$0 cost basis**. And you will have to show them when you acquired your coins. For example, if you held DOGE from 2020 and your cost basis is $0.002 (and DOGE is now $0.40), you'll have to provide the 2020 transaction where you bought DOGE for $0.002 and pay all the capital gains on the difference.  **TL;DR**: you have about 2 weeks to tidy up your books, lock in your gains, and make sure you have crypto and USD exactly where you want them to be when January 1st rolls around.",There's gonna be so many judgy faces when they see the type of coins people buy. lol.,"Oh shit, I had no idea about this.

Crypto, stocks and basically everything that is not real estate, is taxed through the roof.   The reason is political. The majority of Danes have expensive mortgages, so politicians can easily favour the popular vote by appealing to home owners. Because of this, we have made a narrative in Denmark that taxing the top 20% of salaries and taxing everything except real estate by a lot, is the propper strategy to make the economy fair and equal.   In truth, real estate in Denmark is insane. You get your profits from real estate tax free as long as you lived in it for atleast 2 years. To offset this, they tax properties each month but in reality you indirectly pay this real estate tax regardless of whether you rent or buy, because the landlord of a rented apartment will place the monthly expense on the rent to cover the tax, yet renters dont benefit from the taxfree profits when the landlord sells. Because of this, Copenhagen real estate is one of the most profitable investments in Denmark, making people millions in tax free bonuses for simply buying an apartment 5 years ago and selling now.   Denmark wont change this because politically suggesting any change is suicide as the popular vote is dominated by Danes wanting to profit from this insane system.","42% tax on crypto that's called theft, not tax.",All taxes are legal theft,even 28% is too much lol,28% is still shit in a country where everyone earns garbage minimum salary and has no jobs.,"Yep.

People will be conditioned to load up and they will load up the whole way down wondering when the dip will come back. You can mess around with some numbers and see exactly how it would go.

I remember discovering Dogecoin back in early 2014 when $500 would buy you a million, and my friend tried to explain to me (patiently) how that was just a fad and if i really wanted to be a millionaire one day I needed to read some 'Boglehead books' and learn about ETFs and mutual funds.    When i tried to tell my coworkers about bitcoin they all patiently explained to me (how an adult might explain to a child) that Bitcoin wasn't actually worth anything and it wasn't ""backed by anything"".    I was excited to meet my girlfriend's friend's boyfriend once because i heard he was into finance.  He basically spent the entire dinner cracking jokes at my expense and explaining how little i understood money.    When i tried to tell my investment buddy about Monero, and begged him to get into it at 30 cents, he thought it was stupid and said he thought Visa was a better investment for money.  Then when Monero went to $2 each and i continued to rant to him his reaction was ""nice, you sold it all right?"".  Then when it went to $12 each he legit got mad at me that I wouldn't sell it.  By the time it was $50 each he stopped talking to me.    If you've been in crypto for more than 10 years, it's been an exhausting and frustrating experience.    And no, I'm not even close to rich.

The news is even sadly littered with stories of “lucky” people who were murdered for their winnings.  This is not meant to say you can’t help people. Of course you can. Do it quietly if you have to, but don’t say where the money came from. Just say you saved up or had a good year and “loan” them that $500 for the car or whatever, but don’t expect it to come back.
