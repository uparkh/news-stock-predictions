cryptocurrency,Jan,193inem,Bitcoin spot ETF finally approved,,The document is gone now. You can't make that shit up.,aaaaand it's gone,"We're sorry, but sec.gov website acces was compromised. K thx bye",The archived version : https://web.archive.org/web/20240110204508/https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2024/fg-89shlq.pdf,It appeared again,I wait till it gets officially confirmed by the SEC Twitter account.,Hope no one hacked SEC website this time ðŸ˜‚,Looking forward to the press conference with Gensler where he denies he called a press conference.,The SEC are truly trolling us at this point.

cryptocurrency,Jan,19fn11w,"I Took Out $94,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Crypto: 19 Month Update","Not financial advice. Greetings All,  This is my 19 month update since I first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find my previous updates in my post history. The first is from June 2022. A lot has happened since my last update, so Iâ€™ll get right to itâ€¦&amp;#x200B;First off, I managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000! Work has been better than usual and I had a big job in December that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance.Next I decided to buy even more Bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome Credit Card Balance Transfer offers that appeared in August/Septemberâ€¦Two of my credit cards were offering 0% APR for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. I also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. That combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential. Balance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. Also, Iâ€™m only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy. I ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$26,500. This brings my total amount of Bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 Bitcoin!!!!**With the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \~$800.** I can easily afford this. In fact, Iâ€™m putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so I donâ€™t end up paying a lot of interest when itâ€™s all said and done. I plan to have everything paid off in less than two years. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***As of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers I have a total remaining balance of \~$56,000.**It works out like this:$21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan.$35,000 from new balance transfer loans. This brings the total amount of loans that Iâ€™ve taken out so far to $94,000. Iâ€™ve paid a total of \~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \~$98,500 as of January 24th, 2024.**I have acquired a total of 4 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.** **As of today, January 25th, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is \~$40,000.****This brings the total value of the Bitcoin I acquired from loans to $160,000.****This represents an unrealized USD profit of \~$61,500.** The math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500Lastly, Iâ€™m officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. I have a nice round number of Bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which Iâ€™ve been slowly adding to from earned income. Now itâ€™s time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes. Let me know if you have any questions. Not financial advice. ",OP is about to inspire some huge mistakes from lesser smart ppl.,Balls of steel.,"ChatGPT'd this for lazy folk like myself.  Here are the basics.* Total amount of loans taken out: $94,000* Total interest paid to date: ~$4,500* Total cost basis of these loans as of January 24th, 2024: ~$98,500* Total Bitcoin acquired: 4 Bitcoin (~$24,625 per coin)* Current price of Bitcoin as of January 25th, 2024: ~$40,000 per coin* Total value of the Bitcoin acquired from loans: $160,000Glad it worked out.",Loan sharks love him,Fucking balls of titanium ðŸ¤£,Pay off your loans and ride on the profits!,I just didnâ€™t file a tax return that year. Itâ€™s a little trick I picked up over the years.,Many people do this and end up in another world..,If you pay it off quickly then you should be happy long term. $24k average is solid for starting in 2022,My anxiety level is out of control just reading the post.
cryptocurrency,Jan,192qh06,Bitcoin Pumps and then dumps after the SEC Twitter account is compromised and posts a fake announcement saying a spot ETF was approved.,"Something wild just happened. THE SEC posted a tweet saying that the Spot ETF was approved. https://preview.redd.it/emtjx2i1hhbc1.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d2ed8968320684440ce28cc5ea5af5fd3305c69Bitcoin Spiked and then dumped, normal sell the news - market volatility right? https://preview.redd.it/zzzh7es6hhbc1.png?width=1001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccf15d1077653b4b6ec2287962aab4ea03ac8ef8Nope apparently the ETF was never approved a follow up tweet by Gary Gensler said the SEC twitter account was compromised and that it was an unauthorized Tweet. https://preview.redd.it/ly4qyay9hhbc1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=defaf4cc64e3145ab70cb1be761d9edcb87edd7fThe SEC announcement post is now deleted.\-------------I have a feeling whoever made that fake announcement likely made huge money on that pump and now dump, as the market struggles to figure out how to react. Regardless of what happens on the supposed announcement later this week, this is going to be a stain on the inevitable news. ","Itâ€™s either insider trading, market manipulation, piss poor security or sheer incompetence that led to this tweet being made. Either way itâ€™s not good enough from the people who are supposedly deciding whatâ€™s safe to do with our money.Fuck the SEC.",It's been confirmed they didn't have 2FA on their X account lol they want to regulate crypto but can't secure their own X account,Shorts rektLong rektHolders survive ðŸ’ª,So whoâ€™s going to investigate them for market manipulation?,I wanna go back to being a child where I was convinced adults had everything under control. We live in a clown world.,"Just wanted to say thank you for this post. For a long time, big news events were just a race for people to post the link the fastest in the moon economy. Posts like this are what I love about Reddit. A dedicated original thread about a topic someone took their time to make, include media and sources, and a big comment section about it. Really refreshing to see. Cheers ðŸ«‚",Scheduled tweet that went out on the wrong day.,"The dump happened 5 minutes in, 10 minutes before Gary posted about the account being compromised. Why is nobody talking about this?",They got their account back awfully fast....,The SEC used legislation and became confused. It hurt itself in the confusion. SEC fainted.
cryptocurrency,Jan,1acb8hq,Been buying bitcoin every month for 76 months now,"Started in October 2017 with the goal of 'enough bitcoin to retire'. Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&amp;P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month. So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --&gt; buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! And whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, I'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended. Enjoy reading!Ps. doesn't work with shitcoins[https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-36-january-2024/](https://er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-36-january-2024/)","I remember you ! I was wondering what happened to you. Glad to see youre alive and well.I was asking before and I will try again, how did you do the graph that shows BTC total stack and fiat stack","Hey OP - Congrats and keep up the good workâ€¦ do not become a writer when you retire.  Bullet Points for the people in the rafters:OP invests 500â‚¬ of his monthly pay His most recent purchase was at 39,100 â‚¬ / BTC (or ~.013 BTC), giving him ~4.47 BTC total as of today.The total amount invested after 6+ years is ~40k. 500â‚¬ one month at a time. This strategy has thus far yielded a profit of ~330%, whereas the S&amp;P strategy would have given me a profit of 42% for the same amount after 6+ years","Ah to be able to buy at  2017 priced again would be a dream.It's funny you mention you got the idea from FIRE as they absolutely hate crypto, but congrats to you on succeeding!",I admire your discipline and conviction to ride through the ups and downs.,"The PS made me curious and I like spreadsheets so (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wxndMg3mdFlzqhILdtsPI18ipDNDU2LsivLryemdL_M/edit?usp=sharing)[I ran some #s].  If you did this with Ether... * 1 ETH today = â‚¬2094.74* Total ETH = 106.55* Total value = â‚¬223191.87* A little bit over 29% more vs 4.47 BTC valued around â‚¬172,597.83I pulled the historical price data in $ from CoinGecko and got historical USD to EURO rates from a Google function built-in to sheets.",They would really hate this post,Spreadsheet converted with any sort of visual tool probably.,Ya and whatâ€™s your social security and pin code,It hurts knowing I bought almost as much BTC (4) in 2015 or something for like $750. Forgot what I even spent it on tbhâ€¦,this was a very helpful and not snarky comment. thank you.
