wallstreetbets,Jan,1935frs,Is it insider trading if I bought Boeing puts while I am inside the wrecked airplane?,"Purely hypothetical of cause:  Imagine sitting in an airplane when suddenly the fucking door blows out.   Now, while everyone is screaming and grasping for air, you instead turn on your noise-cancelling head-phones to ignore that crying baby next to you, calmly open your robin-hood app (or whatever broker you prefer, idc), and load up on Boeing puts.   There is no way the market couldve already priced that in, it is literally just happening.  Would that be considered insider trading? I mean you are literally inside that wreck of an airplane...  On the other hand, one could argue that you are also outside the airplane, given that the door just blew off...  ",Just imagine being on a plane going down and the mother fucker beside you opens Robin hood and Yolos his life savings on Boeing puts. Do you tell him you're in an Airbus or not?,"This is top content, I am here for.","It's like minority report, the crash was priced in.before it even happened. Sorry, bro, but you'll die for my puts.","Is his phone still in ""airplane mode""","purely hypothetical, but what if OP was the one who unscrewed that nut so that he could buy puts ?Or he could just screw deez nuts idc",Not insider trading at all.  The general public is in that plane.,"But he's trading boeing inside a boeing, so insider trading. Report to SEC","Imagine what happens when you then die and your wife who has no idea how puts work, finds out that they automatically exercised for being in the money and before she covers the short position (at a profit) due to lack of knowledge she waits and the stock price rebounds and now you left your family broke.",I think this would be “uploading to the cloud”,Luckily my wife's boyfriend knows what to do in that case
