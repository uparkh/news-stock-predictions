The Uber wealthy don‚Äôt pay much taxes as a percentage of income or wealth cause their wealth comes from long term capital appreciation and dividends which are taxed at a much lower rate.

I'd rather we reduce public spending by making the government more efficient first and foremost though priority wise, one of those is also scaling back defense spending but that is (unpopularly) also implying we should be scaling back bases in other parts of the world which means those countries in those parts of the world need to step up and spend a larger % of their GDP (looking at you Europe).","I take home about 70% of my paycheck. Then if I want to use that money, I have to pay taxes on those products or services. So the real tax rate is much higher.    Example, I make $50. After taxes and other deductibles, I take home $35. Then I want to go get $35 in Gas (in NJ), sign says $3 a gallon. 33 cents of that is gas tax. So the gas really costs $2.67. So I fill up $35 worth but really only get $31 worth of gas. The other $4 is more taxes. So end of the day, I  have spending power of $31 from my $50 earned.    Meanwhile, billionaires' personal tax in the United States is estimated to be close to 0.5%.","Every year the wealthy becomes wealthier relative to everyone else so they can clearly afford to. So, yes.","I would say pay more fair share of the tax.      Often times, rich has ways to dodge the tax, and many of them end up are paying $0 tax.","Hypocrisy at it's best.

In December I reached out to my recruiter and asked to decline. I signed the paper work and had it returned to them the next day (12/7, paper work was due before 12/13). Just woke up today to an extra $3200.   My question is, how should I got handling this? I don‚Äôt want to stay the whole 18 months.

I‚Äôm looking for suggestions on where to invest this money now. I‚Äôm very new to this type of investment and would appreciate any help that this community can provide.   The picture is just of some options available, but there are lots to choose from.   Is it generally better to go with funds with 1,3 or 5 year returns? I looked at 1 year returns an and they are showing 20% or more where as a lot of 3 and 5 year are showing below 5% or a little over.   I‚Äôm also unsure of the difference of the three options. What are the benefits of choosing 1,3, or 5 year returns.   What‚Äôs a good gross expense/net expense ratio to aim for when looking through funds as well?  Like I said I‚Äôm new to this and no one ever explained this kind of stuff to me, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm just missing some key knowledge.   Any recommended articles or books I can read would be helpful too.   Thanks and happy new year!","Yea those target date funds did well for some reason last year, but generally they lag behind the market by a good bit.

The houses that are left available are the new cookie cutter homes that other investment companies have put up for sale. Buyers who want more than just a small yard can't find anything...

Discover card has too much good will to be purchased by a shitty company like Capital One.,"Discover has low interest rates on their credit card, they tend to be easier for people to get a card who never had one, they have rotating 5% cash back categories on charges, and their banking section has an excellent cash back debit card and high yield savings.",I don't like Warren much but I'm glad she's saying this. We can't keep allowing these corporations to merge. We need to keep these companies separate so they have an incentive to compete for our business and offer better terms than their competitors.,Discover is my favorite card.  This will suck if it goes through.,Discover has great customer service. Capital One does not. Discover will not after the acquisition.,They also have excellent customer service.,Dumb question‚Ä¶ whats great about Discover? I‚Äôve never used them and never thought much about it lol,"Exactly. Usually if someone says ""I don't like this person but"",¬† it might be relevant if the action of the person is going against type, but this is in Warren's wheelhouse.

finance,Feb,1aqsh2q,The Brutal Reality of Plunging Office Values Is Here,,"Good. Rezone to residential, increase housing supply, reduce housing costs.","The way these buildings are designed this is unfortunately not possible. Any building over about 8 floors would need a complete redesign to accommodate the plumbing alone. Your typical office building floor has zero full kitchens and only two bathrooms per floor, also zero showers, and your HVAC is designed to handle 4-5 offices, not 12-15 individual units. It would work for a few of the small buildings, but the ""skyscrapers"" would all have to be torn down and rebuilt. Or we could just say the apartments on any floor above 9 or so needs to just deal with zero water pressure and ask that no more than half the building turns on their AC at a time..","The thing I haven‚Äôt heard anyone mention is how this is going to effect other real estate classes. Take for example a downtown apartment in say Atlanta, GA. 5 years ago it was in the middle of a sprawling downtown that was filled with workers everyday. Because of this lots of restaurants and other shops were able to open and survive off foot traffic. Now that has slowed down, but what happens if more and more of these buildings go bust. Well A) there goes the remaining foot traffic to some of these areas so shops start to close and then B) the person renting an apartment/ buying a condo downtown everytime they walk outside their door they see less and less of the area they wanted to live in and more of what resembles a run down, less than desirable part of town. Are they going to continue to pay elevated prices to live in that area? Probably not so they start to move out faster, leading to apartments having to cut rents to try and entice people to stay/move there. Now these places are under more strain as they would be bringing in less and less revenue each month. Property value of the condos/apartments take a hit because what made them attractive in the first place was being centrally located next to offices/restaurants/shops has gone away. Point being this isn‚Äôt going to stop at Commercial Real Estate. It‚Äôs going to have a big effect on all property values in cities, because who the hell wants to pay a lot of money to live next to a bunch of empty, unused buildings that will just start getting run down.","I can‚Äôt read the article, but it‚Äôs amazing to me how slowly this has happened, it‚Äôs now 4 years after office occupancy first plummeted.","I have no problem writing this on this account, because I use another one for my moving research/communications, but... As a poor, I am moving to a new city soon to try to improve my circumstances, but I have absolutely considered renting an office, working a night job so I'm in the ""office"" during the day, and using a gym for showers.  It's absolutely not ideal but it's about $500 less than an apt. I just need somewhere safe to sleep and keep a few things. It's better than a storage unit.","Commercial leases are often 5-10 years, so a lot of business were stuck waiting for their lease to expire.","On the one hand, a rapid collapse in value of commercial RE would trigger loan write downs that would likely have contagion effect in global credit markets. That is something we should try to avoid if at all possible.  On the other hand, these are not good assets if there is truly a long term shift away from the need for office space. Propping up these assets and the debt they collateralize delays the flow of capital into better and more productive uses.  Maybe the Fed will cut rates more aggressively than they have been signalling and we will escape the reckoning in commercial RE (for now), but I'm not holding my breath. It will be difficult to thread the needle of avoiding a credit crisis while also avoiding zombie office towers.",It can be done but it does require massive re-investment.,"&gt;these are not good assets  Some of them are decent, in good locations, they are just over priced like crazy because the owners overpaid. Let'em default and get back on the market at a reasonable price and they'll get tenants. Local property taxes will take a hit but many are still useful buildings if priced right.",The Fed kept adding liquidity.  Really the amazing thing is just how much liquidity the world‚Äôs central banks have added to the economies and how long it‚Äôs taken for all of the liquidity to get drained.

In fact, he only confessed to his wife because he realized he was screwed: &gt;In late March 2023, FINRA requested a deal chronology from BP, including the names of individuals who were ""in the know"" prior to BP's acquisition of TA. A former BP employee, who had worked on the TA acquisition, reached out to Loudon's wife complaining that BP's lawyers had demanded her home address and other personal information. Loudon's wife shared this conversation with Loudon, who asked if current employees would receive the  same scrutiny. Loudon's wife responded that they would.",What was she supposed to do according to BP? Isn‚Äôt reporting to the SEC the right thing to do?,"seriously. the mega-rich are doing way shitter illegal things, and their insider trading is systematic and widespread. no reason for her to report a measly 1.7 million, no one would even blink an eye at that",Also I thought the SEC gives money to people who come forward with evidence of fraud.,"I thought the issue here was that she didn't keep highly confidential information private enough in the first place.   WFH obviously messed with this a lot, but her husband should not have been in the same room as her while she was having these conversations, and she would have absolutely known that.","&gt; He liquidated every single position he owned in his brokerage and retirement accounts to purchase the stock two months before the acquisition news.

It‚Äôs easy to grow your company 30% if it‚Äôs worth $5 million, but when you‚Äôre sitting at $905 billion, growth is a bit harder.  The real ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù here though, is to hopefully make shareholders less fearful of his passing.  If Berkshire has a bad year this year, then it had a bad year, but everything will be ok because Buffet is at the helm.  If it has a bad year post-Buffet, then his successors are complete failures who aren‚Äôt up to the task, and we need to replace them and/or watch the stock price plummet.",Apple is doing the heavy lifting.,"Quantitative funds are not Berkshire's competitors. They are simply not even in the same field. Those investing billions of dollars in infrastructure, people and data are trying to take advantage of minuscule short-term price discrepancies, something not remotely meaningful to a company like Berkshire. I would argue that the ones that have hindered Berkshire's investments the most have been private equity firms like Blackstone, Apollo Global and KKR.¬†   Even Jim Simmons, founder of Renaissance Technologies, the most successful hedge fund in history says there will always be a place for Warren Buffett-style fundamental investing and that they are not related to anything he does.","Berkshire was also founded well before algorithmic trading.

Banks would always go to an agency that they knew would rate them highly, even if wrong. A bank isn‚Äôt going to complain about rating agencies giving out incorrect ratings if those ratings help them.   Like is said in the big short, if a rating agency doesn‚Äôt give a bank the rating it was (ie the top rating), they will just go to one of there competitors who will. This is crazy. Surely rating agencies must be run by the government and without commission, so that the ratings offered will be fair????",Rating agencies must publish their methodology. They then are required by the SEC to follow said methodology or else lose their NRSRO licence.    Analytical staff are also prohibited from knowing or discussing the fees paid to the agency for work done. So they don't actually know what the deal is when they do the work.    Finally rating agencies publish default tables by rating over time. So it's public data how often companies with each rating default and how long after they receive the rating that happens. So the public should be able to determine which agencies ratings are more trustworthy. Some agencies have almost 100 years of data. Their track record (at least for corporates) is excellent.    It's also investors who typically demand a rating. If the ratings become less useful they may stop demanding them and then the agencies would probably go out of business anyway.,"They generally work just fine, which is why it's such a big deal when they don't.","Also, having a rating from at least one of the big three is pretty much a requirement for being an investment candidate for the big institutional investors.","The institutional investors/lenders investing in securities rated by the agencies do independent due diligence.

Working within your example - if Walmart builds a new office, they aren‚Äôt just paying for that entirely out of pocket. They are using a commercial mortgage to finance the property.

One-off, that isn‚Äôt a big deal - but if it happens en masse it becomes a systemic problem because overexposed institutions will face solvency issues.

Banks have to hold some of their own money relative to the loans and other activities they undertake, in order to be able to absorb losses.

This will make lending more expensive, but it will be much more difficult for a bank to fail (for capital related reasons, liquidity is different)","Basel III is a set of measures developed by the Basel Committee in the years following the global financial crisis of 2007-09. The measures, rolled out over several years, aim to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management of banks.

My company I work with is Delta Controls(highlighted), owned by Delta Electronics. Is their actual profit only $35,630? Or is this the income to the holders of Delta Controls via stock options?   I was not able to find anything sort of advanced break down for the specifics of Delta Controls.   Thanks for dealing with my dumbass.","first this is not a balance sheet.   the left side is a summary of a balance sheet  the right side is a summary of an income statement.  the right side at the top notes ""NT$ in thousands"" what does ""NT"" mean i have no clue  but the thousands means you add ,000 to the numbers you see.  $35,630,000 in profits.","Units in thousands in top right hand side.  Also, this is not a balance sheet. This is a very simplified set of financial information.",the units are in thousands.,"There‚Äôs no need to be rude, but so far you have: - not understood that what you posted is not a balance sheet, but a summary of B/S and P&amp;L - not been able to comprehend that all numbers should be multiplied by 1000, as clearly stated above the table - asked if Net Income is ‚Äúthe income to Stock Holders via Options‚Äù? This does not mean anything. - asked if Net Income is the amount that company directors take home in a year - asked if Sales is related to the sales of stock? Again, this does not make remotely sense.  So yes, I would recommend that you spend an hour looking at the basics before you look at financial statements again, unless you find it easier to learn by piecing together answers from people that take it for granted that you understand how financial statements work, or are least what sales and net income are.","No, not the directors. The directors are salaried. That‚Äôs been deducted.   Corporations are legal entities, owned by shareholders. Net income is corporate take-home. On the balance sheet this is listed as retained earnings.   The directors decide what to do not next - usually either pay dividend to shareholder or re-invest in the company, through investments (machinery, R&amp;D, property purchase etc.)",That is not 2.000.000 it is 2.000.000.000 (units are thousands). No offense but perhaps you may want to take an Accounting 101 course? You seem to be quite lost in this,Dude. ‚ÄúGo take a class‚Äù isn‚Äôt a reasonable response to a simple question. It‚Äôs actually the contrary. Go take a class is a good answer if someone wants to understand when EBITDA is better than raw earnings or how to amortize capital investments. This guy just wants to be able to read a balance sheet.,"Awesome, thanks man!","Hence the recommendation that you look up some Accounting basics before you delve into this. Not to be annoying, but the answers you are looking for would be covered within the first chapter of any college Accounting manual, and you would definitely get a better understanding of everything if you approached it that way.","Then he should pick the first accounting manual he can find and turn to page 1, and he will have a far better answer than he will get from here.   His questions are simple but the answers are not, because he obviously does not have remotely the prior knowledge required to understand the answers to his questions. All he will get from here is small tidbits of information that he will not be able to piece together. 30 minutes on an accounting book or Investopedia would do him far more good."

finance,Mar,1bpz6b3,Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years for multi-billion dollar FTX fraud,How do you feel about this? I feel like 25 years is no where bear enough punishment‚Ä¶.,When do his parents get prosecuted or assets forfeited. Seems like they were involved or at the very least profited off of it.,His parents are literally Stanford Professor on Securities Fard and Finanical crimes.,"I‚Äôd really be looking into any profit his parents made off this right now.  Dude‚Äôs getting two and a half decades of free room and board, and may be walking out to a retirement plan most of us could only dream of.","That's why he was able to get so many investors. He went to MIT for mathematics, Mom Havard law, Dad Yale law. From the outside FTX looked like a safe investment with a huge upside in a new assets class. Until it wasn't.",I appreciate professors who can give real life examples in class,He‚Äôs got quite a salad there he could be a hockey guy.   What made this interesting to me was his level of arrogance and acting like he was immune from getting caught. Terrible thing he did to a lot of people losing millions and billions of dollars.,"No chance he serves even close to the full term. They‚Äôll make a show of him to appease the victims, then after 5-7 years they‚Äôll shuffle him around to some country club prisons and let him out on house arrest for as a non-violent offender for good behavior. He‚Äôll start a consulting firm for other whitecollar criminals and live very comfortably.",Lmao! Fr?,This is why elite schools are mainly valuable for connections.,"This is not true, for federal crimes you need to serve at least 85% of the time"
finance,Mar,1bjl5yv,Feds Uncover Alleged $350 Million Argentinian Money Laundering Scheme in Miami,,"‚ÄúThe companies' Florida documents allegedly listed no wages or earnings for Morani. Customs records showed barely any import-and-export activity for Morani's entities, and he was making no unemployment-fund contributions, indicating he had no staff, investigators say.‚Äù  LMAO, if you‚Äôre gonna launder $350M at least make *some* attempt at cooking books","I genuinely believe that a lot of the world‚Äôs corruption passes through Florida.  I‚Äôve never seen so many religious people with gold and diamonds on them in my life, all in one place. Whether catholic, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim.   It felt apocryphal as a young man seeing that. I think my trip to Florida was when I started to doubt organized religion.",At both the federal and state level regulators are overwhelmed and behind by years in some cases. So yeah. Unless your a publicly listed corporation it ‚Äúcan‚Äù be that easy‚Ä¶ till you get noticed years later.   Source: Guy regularly on the phone for hours to chat with the IRS/States on behalf of clients.,Florida is the money laundering capital of the US.,Fed would find a $100 million dollar cop mafia in Arvada Colorado if they bothered to investigate cops.,"I work in banking compliance (money laundering, terrorist finance, and fraud investigations) I don‚Äôt think people realize how much shady stuff goes on and how companies the government just can‚Äôt police it all.   Banks filed 3.6 million suspicious activity reports in 2022. There are less than 1 million law enforcement officers in the entire United States lol. Of course not all of them are necessarily illegal activity but it just gives you an idea of how hard it is to keep track, and that‚Äôs just stuff the banks pick up on.   Luckily this guy was an idiot and moved a huge amount of cash so it‚Äôs much easier for him to po up on peoples radar.","messi, what are you doing?",In Miami. Thats like pissing on a forest fire. 350m is nothing.,"I liked Miami Vice and CSI Miami, insightful.","There is zero industry in Florida. They don't design or manufacture anything. Their work force is not talented, their education system is completely unremarkable, and their infrastructure is subpar at best.     Yet, it's the 4th largest economy in the US. Something just isn't right."
finance,Mar,1bfgiqu,It‚Äôs Hard to Beat That 7% Mortgage Rate,,I wonder what equalizes rents or home prices? Usually rent is higher than a mortgage because of the risk and maintenance in home ownership. The trend has seen a huge divergence where it is a lot cheaper to rent. So what changes rents go up or home prices come down?,"The inventory problem will hang around for a while, simply because you‚Äôll have to pry my 1.75% from my cold, dead hands.",Good question.  Problem a mix of things that are beyond my scope of understanding.,"Wonder what will happen to all those who figured they could ""easily"" refinance?","Below the rate of inflation, so it is free.",Paywall,Damn. That's almost free!,Here ya go: https://archive.ph/4O8VG,"I bought a house hoping to refinance. My credit union even recommended not buying a lower interest rate because the expectation was rates would go down in a year and they let me refinance once for free.  I‚Äôm fine because I bought less house than I originally wanted to. It helps that I generally know my timeline for how long I‚Äôll stay in it and was building out amortization tables for each place that I toured - comparing it to my incredibly low rent at the time.  Folks will be tightening budgets, but I believe there is technically a lot of slack in the market among the middle class. It‚Äôs dependent on a lot of factors, but plenty of people are eating out and cooking inefficiently. I am among those, but I‚Äôve planned well and know where cuts can be made.  I don‚Äôt live in a tier 1 or even tier 2 city, so cost of living is more manageable than other areas. My two cents.",Arguably the bank is paying you to hold onto their money for them.
finance,Mar,1b8om2c,"Capital One and Discover merger ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô, consumer groups tell Fed",,"So I kinda don't get this. I would have expected having a competitor that can actually rival American Express and at least be a thorn in the side of Visa/MC would be better than Discover basically being nothing more than ""the 4th card"" and Capital One just being ""an bank""","You‚Äôre correct. It‚Äôs absurd and it just plays on the ignorance of those who do not know much of anything about the credit card industry.  The financial industry is not short on credit card issuers. As of last year there were 84 credit card issuers in the United States and it is a well divided market with no single bank taking on too large of a role.  Just the opposite on the payments network space. Realistically there are only 4 true card payment networks: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. With Visa and MasterCard controlling 84% of the payments network! The split is 48% Visa and 36% MasterCard. Discover and AmEx split the remaining 16% fairly evenly at 8%-8%. So they cannot compare to the duopoly of Visa &amp; MC.  Capital One moving all of their cards to a new payment network reduces the share that Visa &amp; MC have as well as increasing the Discover payment network. That makes the industry much more competitive as a whole. Most estimates put Capital One &amp; Discover of a merger at a 20% payment network. So you would have AmEx still at 8%, C1 at 20%, and the remaining 72% split by Visa and MC depending on how much the C1 exit of their networks impacted them. Much closer to at least a Big 3 instead of a duopoly. If MC &amp; Visa are proportional on C1 (likely not perfectly) then it would be 32% MC and 40% Visa.  Most people look at this from a banking or card issuer perspective which is asinine with 84 card issuers out there. This is about making a more competitive card payment network.","They‚Äôre also by far the biggest issuer in the subprime credit card industry space. Most banks will not give credit cards to subprime customers.  Richard Fairbanks actually inquired with the CFPB about exiting from most of the subprime space for credit cards. This was way back when Richard Cordray was the director of the CFPB. Cordray was adamant that he did not want C1 to exit that space as there was no one else to step in. He feared that millions of borrowers would be forced to utilize payday loans, loan sharks, further late payments/defaults, and other harmful means to fill that gap.  Cordray was no shill for C1 either. He fined them for more than one violation, one was for violations of the Service Members Civil Relief Act and I believe the other was a UDAAP violation that was actually from a contractor/3rd party that C1 had hired. Those were decently significant fines too. So Cordray had no bias to just take their side.",How is it dangerous?  One is a card issuer the other is a payment network?  By merging they'd provide legit competition to Mastercard and Visa as Capital One is the largest card issuer and they could boost the Discover network usage.  Thus increasing competition as far as networks go.,Visa and Mastercard political donations at work.,"I mean, the real reason why so many people are doing this is because ""big bank"" is a dirty term on reddit, and people don't like monopolies, so they're looking for any win possible, even when it's not really a win when you look closer.  On the side, god its insane that CapOne is 12% of the CC world as a whole",Agreed. Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt go through,"It's like the blockage of JetBlue and Spirit, these arguments just keeps the status quo. Who benefits from that? The market leaders. These groups rather have market dominant leaders and also rans, that's not a competitive market at all.","The only thing is that Discover currently doesn‚Äôt have much international acceptance. Only Visa and Mastercard do. Even with a merger, many of Capital Ones‚Äôs cards cannot realistically be transitioned to the Discover network due to the lack of the international presence. Of course the goal would likely be to grow that long term, I‚Äôd assume. Just easier said than done.",Incredibly well put and I wish I could upvote this comment twice.
finance,Mar,1b7m74v,Question about a car loan,Does that mean I still have to pay full Financial Charge even if I pay off early? Says will not be entitled to a refund of a part of the Financial Change.,This is hell.,Financing 100k of a car is a horrible idea,If you can adford the 100k cars shouldnt be much of a concern  for a few period interest lol,What the hell kind of car is this for!?!,"In this market, 7.7% isn‚Äôt even crazy high.   The idea of the finance charge virtually being a ‚Äúfee‚Äù is bullshit.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no prepayment penalty but you‚Äôre also definitely paying the whole thing as if you waited out the entire term.‚Äù   Sure as hell sounds like a prepayment penalty to me.","No, the finance charge is what you pay if you let the loan mature (48 months). Car loans are simple interest so you‚Äôd pay less if you pay it off early.",I bet it's a cybertruck,"Interest rates are way up, this is a pretty average rate right now. I‚Äôm guessing your 1.99% was pre 2023??",What do you mean? The interest rate being so high or the amount?,This is a common misconception. It makes zero sense to dump hard earned cash in into a guaranteed depreciating asset.
finance,Mar,1bgxble,The Deposit Myth: How a linguistic glitch confuses the hell out of economists and the public alike,,"The public may be confused about fractional banking at times, but economists certainly are not.",This is a dumb article that tries to create a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist for anyone in the banking industry,"This article is truly embarrassing.  Author actually thinks economists are confusing liabilities with assets lol, and he's the only one to discover this secret confusion.","What is the point of harping on this conflation? People generally understand the concept of fractional reserve banking, and being pedantic about the word ""deposit"" didn't seem to help explain it better in any meaningful way. I expected this article to describe an actual misconception that's created but it seems like the point is just to be a grammar Nazi.","He could have just said ""deposit is a verb, it's confusing to use it as a noun"" and been done with it.","Again though, is it actually wrong to say that banks need people to make deposits in order to lend out money, or are you just being pedantic about the word ""deposit""? Like what part of the actual concept is incorrect besides the fact that you just think they shouldn't use the word ""deposit""?","But what's the actual misconception that results from this? Are people actually misunderstanding how deposits work, or are we just upset that they're using ""deposit"" in a colloquial way and trying to get a grammatical gotcha?","Again you're just nitpicking my language. Banks can't issue unlimited money; they need people to deposit (or whatever verb you want to use) money into the bank, and then they can issue some fractional amount above that amount. This is not a concept people actually misunderstand; you just think they need to use different language to describe it.","Lol ""I'm only willing to engage on grammar pedantry; I don't feel like explaining why any of this matters in real terms"". Yeah I can understand why this article appeals to you.","I also see a lot of complaints about fractional reserve banking, but no cries for a system where a bank charges fees to keep money with them in lieu of fractional reserve, instead of providing interest on accounts, which our current system allows."
finance,Mar,1bqufui,Shohei Ohtani and deferred salary. Can someone explain how this is beneficial? ,"So of you are into American baseball, you definitely know how ohtani and other players on the dodgers are deferring salary to keep the dodgers 2024 payroll low. I really would like a financial perspective on this. What's the benefits? What are the pitfalls? What's the long term projection vs the short term wow reaction this has created?","Well the article says it‚Äôs about when he pays income taxes and where.   Generally in sports guys are actually paid by the game and pay income taxes to the state they worked in for that game.   Right now, every game he plays in California (which is probably 90+ games given the division he‚Äôs in) he pays the highest state income tax in the country on every paycheck.   By deferring most of his money probably until after he‚Äôs retired, he can move and will pay taxes based on where he lives at that time. Potentially he could move back to Japan and (I assume) not pay any state income taxes.",California will come after you for strategies like this.,The benefits are that it frees up team payroll to sign other good players.   He can avoid some state tax by deferring income.  Tax isn‚Äôt the main motive. Winning is.,Maybe. We'll just have to see.,Just don‚Äôt own property in California and they can try all they want,"Naww, they only go after the easy targets (lower and middle class).",It‚Äôs odd and there really isn‚Äôt a valid explanation other than he wanted to help them win. He literally doesn‚Äôt even collect interest on the money so there is no tax benefit.  He also opted to play in US when he could have made more than 10x the salary in Japan for the past few years. Then when he finally was eligible for a big contract he does this.  WSJ had an article about all his strange past behavior with money the other day. Suffice to say he just doesn‚Äôt care about money.,Luxury tax,"Two big finance reasons: time value of money and cash flow.¬†  TVM says a dollar tomorrow is worth less than a dollar today. So by deferring payments until 2034-2043 the Dodgers will save money (the amount paid in this case is not accruing interest).  From a cash flow perspective, the Dodgers don‚Äôt have the liquid cash available right now to give Ohtani $70M a year. They can make plans for ten years from now to have the cash on hand to satisfy these contractual obligations.¬†  Those are the benefits: they‚Äôll be paying less and they can prepare to have cash on hand when the time comes.¬†  The pitfalls are that it‚Äôs a huge future obligation. If something goes wrong, like a players strike in 2034 disrupts the cash flow of the Dodgers, they still have to make these payments. All else being equal, this contract increases their risk of bankruptcy. It will also make it more difficult for them to make similar deals for a while.","TVM isn‚Äôt a reason here. He reportedly had the contract and then suggested this, and he doesn‚Äôt get interest. So it hurts him big time, but I don‚Äôt think he got a bigger salary from the arrangement.  Also I‚Äôm not sure about baseball, but in NFL you have to put guaranteed money in escrow. Might not be the same rule in MLB, but if it is then that would wipe out any risk. He would also likely be a claimant in a bankruptcy case if they did default and didn‚Äôt have to escrow, so as long as they are not heavily indebted, that isn‚Äôt much risk that he won‚Äôt eventually get paid."
finance,Mar,1bpz2xw,Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison for orchestrating FTX fraud,,He'll spend his 30s and 40s in prison - some of the best years of life.  That seems very significant to me.,"Federal inmates are required to serve 85% of their sentence before being eligible for release, so I‚Äôd bet that SBF will be released after serving 21.25 years. This is pretty much a slap on the wrist for the level of theft he committed.",So you‚Äôre saying the best case scenario for him is that he‚Äôs released when he‚Äôs 53 years old? That doesn‚Äôt sound like a ‚Äúslap on the wrist‚Äù to me.,"Threw the kitchen sink at him, lol",[deleted],But but he‚Äôs a genius.

finance,Mar,1bd1l7r,Dealmaking slowdown leaves private equity with record unsold assets,,Deals are mostly for suckers these days. Until it flips back people go far away,He means valuations aren‚Äôt what sellers are underwriting because rates are still high and money is tight. They can‚Äôt get their returns via a liquidity event so they are holding onto assets and investments that they would like to have sold by now.,"Paywalled, can we get a sneak peak?",What do you mean deals are for suckers?,I understand your second part.  But what do you mean by ‚Äúvaluations aren‚Äôt what sellers are underwriting‚Äù?,http://archive.today/jYKFn,You‚Äôre not my master,"There is no one way it happens. But in a dividend recap, maybe I have a legacy fund that needs to be paid out because my limited partners are getting impatient. So what I'll do is I'll take some of the proceeds from the refinancing and then pay some of the back. I may then take equity from either the same fund or a new fund (this is sometimes called cross fund investment) and contribute equity from other limited partners and myself (I'm the general partner).   In my example, it's more akin to your second question than to your first question.","As an example, in overly simple terms, if I buy a company for $100 and I have a goal of making 20% on my investments, I won‚Äôt sell the company I bought unless I can get at least $120 for it.   Right now, it‚Äôs hard to pencil growth for a lot of investors because interest rates are higher than when they got into a deal (aka in my example when they bought in). So valuations may not be high enough to sell.   Further to that, in the private equity world, debt is a major factor in a company‚Äôs capital structure. Debt today is more expensive than debt when a private equity firm got into a deal. Interest rate hedges are also more expensive now so it‚Äôs harder to finance transactions while reducing interest rate risk. On top of that, refinance risk is higher, and if a private equity firm can‚Äôt find a buyer, it‚Äôs more likely to do something called a dividend recap, which is when a company refinances debt and the private equity firm takes a dividend with part of the proceeds. It then contributes more equity to the company but it also allows for potential legacy investors to get out. Net net the private equity firm may see its equity levels drop proportionally If rates are higher today than when it first bought into the deal.","basically, because of the high interest rates they are unable to offload the companies that they own for a desired price (they could take a loss of course) because no one will buy them with a HI loan. the problem arises when their clients (pension funds for example) eventually want their money back.  the problem is all over the PE space.

High-skill, context-dependent jobs get outsourced, the results are substandard, customers churn, jobs come back for 4-7 years. Rinse repeat.

If a company wanted to reprice they would normally go to whatever bank/lender the loan is with and request a lower interest rate. The lender can say no to lowering the rate but then the company may look for other lenders to refinance the debt.   My guess is that current repricing is related to interest rates. The Fed has indicated that they plan on 3 rate cuts later this year. If companies expect interest rates to come down, they may go to their lender and ask to reprice their loan at a lower interest rate."

finance,Apr,1c150bs,The Worst Part of a Wall Street Career May Be Coming to an End,,AI won‚Äôt replace investment work but it‚Äôll definitely cut down the number of people for sure.   You don‚Äôt need to have an army of 22 year olds spending 12 hours making sure every graph in PowerPoint is perfectly aligned or spending a whole day reading through bond documents to find one sentence.,"That kind of work could always have been done by lower paid employees or temps, you don‚Äôt need Ivy League grads to format pitch decks. But the business model is that those analysts are being filtered and trained to become more senior bankers and that the grind is an essential part of that process.   It remains to be seen whether the industry can create a sufficient pipeline of junior bankers to become senior bankers if they eliminate the traditional selection methods.","Having sat on both sides of recruiting, this year conducting interviews for a large publicly traded bank for a M&amp;A team, I think that at this point, banking is just about as meritocratic as any other industry, if not more. Because perfection in almost every aspect is demanded in any of these groups, sure a connection might get you in the door, but if you end up getting a spot and keeping it, you are extremely likely to have earned it. The reality is that in every job, nepotism exists. In my opinion, it is harder to exist in banking given the ruthlessly competitive nature of the job. If you are dead weight, your entire team will hate you and you will get no bonus and end up leaving, no matter who your dad is. I know it‚Äôs a trope on Reddit specifically that ‚Äúhigh finance‚Äù is full of nepotism, but I think in today‚Äôs day and age, that is more so borne out of contempt for people making a lot of money.","That pipeline has always existed, it's called nepotism",Same goes other industries - the junior ranks will get culled as their work is the most ripe for replacement. Managers and dealmakers will be fine as their skillet is uniquely human ‚Ä¶ for now.  Young lawyers face a similar challenge as AI gobbles up discovery work hitherto dominated by fresh blood.,"Everyone in this thread thinking that new tech is going to replace juniors in any industry is a fucking moron and you should feel bad. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs Amazon, Chipotle, BAML or Latham. I don‚Äôt trust a robot to figure out that it skimped on chicken because a tube got clogged anymore than I‚Äôll trust AI to not rely on zerohedge articles that are suspiciously bullish on the branded rare mineral space.   There‚Äôs been bad poorly done, easily-manipulated data providers putting out absolute shit for ten years. Check any free research doc you got. It‚Äôs not proprietary, it‚Äôs shit filtered through branding to give the guise of being interesting. Some even use tech and outsourcing, but they‚Äôll still lump in Coke and some OTC food company in Alabama together and claim them together as relevant comps.  A computer is as useful as the one using it is skilled. We‚Äôve had constant improvements in tech and out sourcing and every time the number of juniors hasn‚Äôt been affected. Juniors are the ones who use the computers. They will continue to be in office, relying on a number of tools to do their work.   Will some bank think they can run lean and cut jobs? Sure. Will they win deals? Not 6 months later when they‚Äôve failed their sell sides. You think an MD is going to stay on their phone at 10pm emailing comments and minor tweaks to a presentations team in Eastern Europe or India giving the 1000th comment on how Yuri‚Äôs spelling is shit? Just wait until the MD isn‚Äôt a native English speaker and starts missing crap. The AI is definitely going to have the selective info given by clients to tell why firm x isn‚Äôt going to buy company y, and will spit out anyone with a Pitchbook investment preference remotely overlapping that sector. What‚Äôs that? 10 of your ideal buyers are on this page even though they quietly closed 5 years ago when the founders grabbed their bag and wound down the fund?    Also, you‚Äôre all telling on yourselves thinking a lawyer negotiating NDAs will get replaced by AI. AI will hit a snag the second one PE firm decides some bs term is mandatory, and the banks simultaneously disagree, and then bam log jam that requires twice as many lawyers to sort out. Fuck outta here if you think an EL.   Tech increases the effectiveness of workers but it‚Äôs not replacing jobs. If you think anyone will trust computers over people in anything financial, then go play slots.   Where AI will come into play is summarizing research made by actual experts, spot checking page number placement, highlighting differences in versions that were mistakenly not tracked with track changes, and dear lord maybe they‚Äôre even useful and can properly aggregate random KYC docs and fill out an internal form that someone abroad is going to misread. The difference is that the kids will spend less time googling random shit and will instead use AI powered by google to find answers. Maybe they even get to log off at a proper time.",Don‚Äôt bring real world knowledge to Reddit. /s,"Agreed, I went to an Ivy filled with networking, connections, and nepotism.       99% of the people that got jobs in high finance just applied online and maybe went to some info sessions when banks visited the campus (but these are available, to some extent, at many public universities as well).        Do¬†networking, connections, and nepotism play a role? Yes of course, but Reddit overstates it and pretends that‚Äôs how everyone gets a high-paying job. A state school kid that is constantly reaching out to alumni and networking will almost always do better than the average Ivy League nepo baby.",A low paid temp is a risk because they‚Äôre going to make more mistakes‚Äîand those mistakes can be very costly. And you don‚Äôt want to have to manage an army of temps putting in half-hearted work. It‚Äôs easier to manage a handful of smart and hardworking analysts who are eager to prove themselves.,"I am equity research analyst working for a big bank in nyc where I cover the biggest tech and gaming stocks   Our team is definitely not yet ‚Äòsleeping in two hours later‚Äô as it mentions in the article  AI tools have greatly reduced the need for analysts to build spreadsheets as there are AI companies that are maintaining large spreadsheet models for all publicly traded companies, which automatically update after the company files any documents with the sec.   AI has greatly reduced the time it took to build and maintain models.   I have found it far less helpful in terms of generating insightful text that I can use in my reports. Yes AI can reiterate the news, and it can generate summaries of what happened, but it completely fails to analyze what happened, it cannot state why xyz was important, maybe I was testing the wrong tools but we tested a bunch of generative ai tools and it was difficult generating text because the analysis part of the ai seemed lacking."

finance,Apr,1cd9bye,WSJ: Trump Allies Draw Up Plans to Blunt Fed‚Äôs Independence,,"Planning to massively devalue the dollar &amp; erode Fed Independence? What could go wrong? Bahahaha, wow","If Trump got his way, interest rates would be negative. The facts are that if he does that, inflation would go nuts.",Political whims (particularly those of an oompa loompa resembling convicted-fraud) determining monetary policy is a terrible idea.,"**Trump Allies Draw Up Plans to Blunt Fed‚Äôs Independence**   *Some Trump advisers argue that the president should be consulted on interest-rate decisions*  Donald Trump‚Äôs allies are quietly drafting proposals that would attempt to erode the Federal Reserve‚Äôs independence if the former president wins a second term, in the midst of a deepening divide among his advisers over how aggressively to challenge the central bank‚Äôs authority.  Former Trump administration officials and other supporters of the presumptive GOP nominee have in recent months discussed a range of proposals, from incremental policy changes to a long-shot assertion that the president himself should play a role in setting interest rates. A small group of the president‚Äôs allies‚Äîwhose work is so secretive that even some prominent former Trump economic aides weren‚Äôt aware of it‚Äîhas produced a roughly 10-page document outlining a policy vision for the central bank, according to people familiar with the matter.  The group of Trump allies argues that he should be consulted on interest-rate decisions, and the draft document recommends subjecting Fed regulations to White House review and more forcefully using the Treasury Department as a check on the central bank. The group also contends that Trump, if he returns to the White House, would have the authority to oust Jerome Powell as Fed chair before his four-year term ends in 2026, the people familiar with the matter said, though Powell would likely remain on the Fed‚Äôs board of governors.  It couldn‚Äôt be determined whether Trump is aware of or signed off on the effort, but some people close to the discussions believe the work has received the blessing of the former president.  ‚ÄúLet us be very specific here: unless a message is coming directly from President Trump or an authorized member of his campaign team, no aspect of future presidential staffing or policy announcements should be deemed official,‚Äù Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement.  Trump, who often tells advisers that he loves low interest rates and expressed frustration that he couldn‚Äôt influence them as president, hasn‚Äôt yet decided exactly how he would approach the Fed in a second term, people close to him said. He is focused foremost on the coming election, his continuing legal troubles and his search for a running mate. But he has had informal discussions with advisers about possible candidates to lead the central bank, and he has asked associates whether they would be interested in the job, the people said. Trump has repeatedly complained‚Äîin public and in private‚Äîabout Powell, continuing a yearslong campaign to discredit the man he picked to lead the Fed.  Several people who have spoken with Trump about the Fed said he appears to want someone in charge of the institution who will, in effect, treat the president as an ex officio member of the central bank‚Äôs rate-setting committee. Under such an approach, the chair would regularly seek Trump‚Äôs views on interest-rate policy and then negotiate with the committee to steer policy on the president‚Äôs behalf. Some of the former president‚Äôs advisers have discussed requiring that candidates for Fed chair privately agree to consult informally with Trump on the central bank‚Äôs decisions, the people familiar with the matter said. Others have made the case that Trump himself could sit on the Fed‚Äôs board of governors on an acting basis, an option that several people close to the former president described as far-fetched.  The discussions have alarmed some Trump advisers with more-traditional views of the role of the Fed, as well as Republican lawmakers. They worry that chiseling away at unwritten norms around keeping politics at arm‚Äôs length from Fed decisions could backfire, particularly if political interference leads investors to conclude that the central bank is willing to tolerate higher inflation. That could raise long-term interest rates, including rates on mortgages, credit cards and auto debt, when the U.S. government has to roll over trillions of dollars in debt annually. One former Trump administration official described the prospect of Trump‚Äôs influencing interest rates as a ‚Äúhorrifying thought.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGiven their charge, their independence is critical to doing it in an unbiased, nonpolitical way,‚Äù said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.), who said he would oppose efforts by any president to challenge the Fed‚Äôs autonomy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason that there‚Äôs not just one decision maker‚Äîthat there are safeguards built into a board of governors.‚Äù  Sen. Thom Tillis (R., N.C.) said he, too, wouldn‚Äôt condone efforts by a president, including Trump, to interfere with monetary policy. ‚ÄúI have to think about the Fed for the next 50 years, not the next four, and independence is important,‚Äù he said.  Any effort by Trump to exert control over the Fed would face significant institutional hurdles. Even if a court upheld an effort to demote Powell as chair, Trump would likely need to elevate one of the Fed‚Äôs other six governors to the position because there are no vacancies on the central bank‚Äôs board. Two of those governors were installed by Trump.  A Fed appointment is akin to putting a jurist on the Supreme Court: Once someone is installed, it is difficult to force him or her out. Supreme Court justices have a lifetime appointment, and Fed governors have 14-year terms to provide a degree of independence from politics.",Leave the economy to the economists ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),He plans to be a dictator.

finance,Apr,1bz1s5r,A Lego Model of Financial Capitalism,,"Thanks for writing this but the explanation is a bit wrong. You do not give someone money in return for future profits. You BUY a fractional share of the company. Which includes the rights to dividends (profits that are paid out). To small consumers that is how it looks, but it is just a small part of stock ownership. Your voting rights are proportional to ownership and with sufficient shares you have effective control of the company and even the option to take it private for full control. Profits are often NOT paid out, most companies pay less than full profits as dividends, some even pay zero - they put that money back into capital investment to grow future profits faster. Lastly in the original case of forming a company no money is given to anyone for the share, it is a capital investment forming the company itself. Then the original holders sell their rights and so on until perhaps you buy them. There is no special party you are giving money to, you are buying from an owner and now you are the owner of that fractional share.  Stock ownership should be explained as fractional shares. Nothing else about a public company, or its future behavior, can be explained without understanding that first."

Trump owns 56% of the shares, but he has a lock out period where the SEC won't allow him to sell his shares of about 6 months after the merger (not 90 days). He is also not allowed to use them as collateral in that time period. This could be bypassed theoretically if the board of DJT were to waive the lock out period but they'd have to prove that it was for the good of every share holder and not just Trump or the SEC would just say no. So he'll probably have to wait out the full 6 month period before he can sell or use his shares as collateral.   Recently they announced another round of shares being created. Diluting the value of the existing shares. Further pushing the share price down. I heard a rumor that this is some shady way of bypassing the holding period for Trump, but that's not confirmed.   So in short there's nothing Trump can do for a while other than watch as the share price plummets.  The options market for DJT is pricing in a downward move to around 5 dollars a share by Sept 20th. Around the time he'd be able to sell his shares. If he did the share price would crater to pennies as soon as he sold. He'll be able to extract millions of dollars from whomever was an idiot enough to invest in this dumpster fire of a company.","The value is tied to being a meme stock where earnings and other metrics don‚Äôt matter compared to trumps social popularity. The majority of shares are owned by very few people so it‚Äôs not as susceptible to major price swings   Also, in the same way foreign diplomats would stay at trump hotels in DC to earn favor from trump, they want to buy shares in this organization.  This company is trumps ticket to stay out of financial ruin and anyone who holds shares and helps increase its valuations will absolutely be seen as a friend to trump.   If he wins the election, this thing is gonna skyrocket via foreign and corporate ownership","&gt;  I heard a rumor that this is some shady way of bypassing the holding period for Trump, but that's not confirmed.  Trump selling shares would move money from new buyers directly into his own pocket.   But, DJT selling new shares moves money from new buyers into the COMPANY'S pocket, and, DJT owns 50+% of the company, so, it is a way of trying to get the most out of new buyers and put it in a place where you can access it later.","Thank you. What about the money that people paid to buy the IPOd 44 percent of stock?  How much did they pay, and can Trump direct the use of the money?  I believe these funds are controlled by rules that are designed to protect investors, but I feel like there must be ways to get around the rules, such as spending the money then trying to delay any consequences via legal actions indefinitely, as he‚Äôs doing with his current indictments.","&gt;What about the money that people paid to buy the IPOd 44 percent of stock?  They paid whatever the current price was when they bought.   &gt; can Trump direct the use of the money?   yes, the business itself can spend any of it's own money how ever it wants. So those shares that were announced the other day could be used to fund expenditures on whatever the company wants. The board is filled with sycophants that are just yes men for whatever trump wants to do. Could he use the Company to pay his legal fees? Probably. He uses everything else he can for it.",Thanks. Great detailed responses.,Your assessment assumes Trump follows the law which he has a 77 year history of not doing. It reasonable to assume he won‚Äôt follow the law about lockup periods here.

finance,Apr,1cfl4ok,Markowitz Optimization,I took four finance classes in college. I learned how to do Markowitz optimization. I am unsure by the result of my analysis though. How could covariance affect FMCMX if no other fund is involved? Why does it matter how it covaries with FXAIX if there is no presence of FXAIX?,"Having trouble interpreting your inputs vs outputs in your screenshot but I‚Äôm assuming the 100% FNCMX was the output.   I think your question is basically ‚Äúwhy does the covariance matrix matter if I just have one fund?‚Äù If I‚Äôm correct, then you are confusing input and output. Just because the output is one fund doesn‚Äôt mean that matrix wasn‚Äôt used as an input in the model.   FWIW, single asset solutions are common with this optimization and will always be the one that maximizes your return per unit of risk, given your chosen assets and constraints. Basically what this is telling you is the efficient frontier that is possible with the inputs you provided can be achieved by only investing in FNCMX."

The point I was trying to make is that a robust market benefits everyone even if the company is not accessing it. It‚Äôs the whole underpinning of why investors give the company money early on.   Think of it this way. If you are Google, it‚Äôs true that stock price increases help somewhat - you can issue stock at a high price, you can compensate employees etc. But you also asked about the ‚Äúeconomic purpose‚Äù of stock markets.

Do you know why those investors are willing to provide capital to a company? Because eventually they can exit at a profit. Often public markets is the way for that to happen.

The result of their work generates income, and that income can be allocated to savings, which can then be invested. So in order to have something to even invest, economic activity has to take place to begin with.  2. When buying a share of a company, they have a residual claim on the earnings of that company. If the company performs economically well, the resulting profit of that economic activity is allocated to the shareholders. From there, it's either retained (reinvested into the company... more economic activity!) or distributed as a dividend, which is cash, which can then, you guessed it, be used to buy/sell goods and services (economic use).

What could go wrong?,"Not to take away from the debate re. ESG funds, but for context - ‚Äúworst ever outflows‚Äù for US funds may reflect general rebalancing towards ex-U.S. assets. U.S. ESG funds benefited from earlier launches and faster adoption vs non-U.S. peers.  The $8.8bn of outflows from the U.S. ESG funds is still bps relative to the $3tn total ESG assets per the article (29bps).

Citigroup did not dispute the regulator‚Äôs findings and agreed to settle the claims.

Basically saying if all corporations paid their taxes at 21% or higher, instead of using account tricks to lower their effective rate below 10%, then we‚Äôd have so much tax revenue that individual people would never need to pay taxes.   I don‚Äôt have those exact numbers, but buffet is no dummy.",I believe Bill Gates has also said something similar.  Corporations and Wall Street would never agree to this. They are too busy giving themselves millions in executive pay while laying off workers.,"My small-business father was adamant that ""businesses don't pay taxes; consumers do.""  So whatever the business pays is essentially overhead that then forces businesses to raise their prices, passing the tax onto the consumer. Depending on the business, this would effectively be making more taxes regressive tax.  Anyone care to explain to me where my reasoning is incorrect?",Sadly he's a tycoon in the minority on this subject. If I were wrong his quote wouldn't need to have been said.,"Both Bill gates and Warren Buffet have committed to giving away 90+% of their wealth. They don't mind paying a higher tax. There's a phrase, ""You never see a Uhaul behind a hearse.""  Both of them are wise enough to see that.","I always assumed that when politicians say things like, ""make corporations pay their fair share! raise their taxes!"" they were lying and they knew it. Or maybe some of the stupider congressional reps didn't, but most understand what they're doing.  But Warren Buffet?? Why would he say this?","No, he is not. He's literally saying that if 800 companies each paid $5 billion in taxes, that would equal the total revenue the federal government collects in taxes on individuals.  800 \* $5 billion is $4 trillion. That's more than the total profits of every corporation in the US. This would require every corporation in the US paying not a 21% tax rate, but a 112% tax rate.",Right,"Fair in this context is pretty cut and dry. It's defined by tax law. If you're unsure what your fair share of taxes is try underpaying taxes next year and the IRS will be happy to tell you what the law defines as fair down to the cent.  If you don't think fair as defined by the law is fair according to your values the best you can do is everything in your power to change it.  In this clip he's saying the law is unfair according to his value by virtue of the fact that if billionaire companies paid the relatively low tax rate of 21% (a rate paid by everyone above the poverty line) at lot of our countries deficit problems could be alleviated.   He's calling for whatever changes needed to be made that will ensure billionaire companies pay a pretty generous tax rate compared to everyone else, as defined by the current laws.","No, because that would be an ignorant thing to say, and I'm not ignorant.  Dividends and buybacks actually increase tax revenue, because they're taxed once as corporate profits and again as individual income, whereas if the corporation just keeps the cash it's only taxed as corporate income.   Executive compensation over $1 million per year is also double-taxed because that's the maximum that can be deducted. So, again, cutting compensation actually reduces tax revenues.   The vast majority of corporate tax deductions are totally uncontroversial things like cost of goods sold, employee compensation, and depreciation, i.e. things that aren't taxed as profits because they're literally not profits. I suppose maybe there are some questionable deductions in there, but orders of magnitude less than you're imagining.  Again, even if you taxed corporate profits at 100%, it wouldn't yield $4 trillion. And it certainly wouldn't be sustainable: Who's going to invest in a country that pulls that kind of banana-republic crap? Raising corporate income taxes reduces the return to investing in a country, which results in less investment, less productivity growth, and lower wages, which also means it reduces the base for other taxes. It's one of the worst ways to raise revenue.   Abject ignorance and seething resentment of people who are more successful than you is a poor basis for a political ideology."

Medical debt affects that, and thus it's relevant.

What's my point?¬† It's this: people seem to think private enterprise is the shining example of cut-throat efficiency and precision, always ready to adopt new technology to create new efficiencies.¬† It absolutely is not.¬† They already have the tools to automate more than 50% of the work but they fail to do so due to a mix of ancient boomer managers that should retire, ignorance of MBA holders that are focused on self-promotion and buzzwords, security departments that seem to believe they have the technical acumen to evaluate¬† the risks of software produced by Microsoft, some employees that simply don't give a shit, and budgets that somehow justify dozens of full time employees yet cannot justify the investment in software and hardware, which to be fair sometimes comes back as ""well, to stand up and implement your Raspberry Pi we will require a new 1 million per year service contract so a DBA in a remote location can be contacted to turn the device on and off once a month but will refuse to do so until you contact his product owner who will need to generate a ticket that his scrum master will then inform him of and then they will go to planning and determine the size and priority of the request which the scrum master will then communicate to the product owner who will make a decision on what work will be done in the next sprint who will then communicate the expected date of the power cycling back to you just in time for your retirement party.""

If you look at the report, it points out that bank teller jobs decreased as ATM usage rose, but that accountant jobs didn't decrease with the advent of spreadsheets. This is 'technology's role in finance' and then goes into the AI part.  &gt; AI is likely to transform banking from the inside and the outside. From the inside, it is automating repetitive tasks and augmenting information heavy tasks, thus bringing productivity benefits (value to employees, potentially) which may translate into more profits (value to shareholders, potentially).   &gt; These bots, equipped with sophisticated algorithms and access to vast amounts of data, will negotiate with financial institutions to secure the best possible deals for their users.

They're desperate for their wild shit of ""America's a 3rd world country"" to be shown true","Here's a quick summary of the article:  In the article ""Top Dollar: Why the Dominance of America‚Äôs Currency Is Harder Than Ever to Overturn"" by Eswar Prasad, the enduring dominance of the U.S. dollar in global finance is explored. Despite criticisms of the dollar's power and influence, including its use as a geopolitical tool and concerns over U.S. economic stability, the currency remains the most widely used and trusted worldwide. The U.S. economy's size, dynamism, and the stability of its financial markets contribute to the dollar's continued prominence.  Efforts by other countries to challenge the dollar's dominance, such as promoting their own currencies or exploring alternatives like gold or cryptocurrencies, have so far failed to significantly impact the dollar's position. The euro and the Chinese renminbi, once seen as potential rivals, have not been able to surpass the dollar. Even amidst political and economic turmoil, the dollar has emerged as a safe haven for investors, further solidifying its status as the primary global reserve currency.  The article also highlights the risks associated with the U.S. public debt and political instability, which could potentially weaken the dollar. However, the lack of viable alternatives and the sheer size of U.S. financial markets continue to reinforce the dollar's strength. The author emphasizes that the dollar's resilience is not solely a result of U.S. strength but also stems from the weaknesses in other major economies and their institutional frameworks.  In conclusion, the article suggests that unless significant changes occur in the global economic landscape or U.S. policies drastically undermine confidence in the dollar, its dominance is likely to persist. The U.S. can further solidify the dollar's position by implementing sound economic policies and maintaining the independence of institutions like the Federal Reserve. Ultimately, the story of the dollar's supremacy is more about the weaknesses of other countries than the strength of the United States.","We treat our working class like the third world, but brics moved the needle as much as an ice cube in the desert could","They largely overestimate the speed at which these kinds of changes take place.

A better idea may be to refinance the HELOC into another to 20 or 30 year loan at a lower interest rate than 7.25% with another lender. This can happen if your mother's income qualifies. A well qualified person can get that rolled into a loan under 7%. I strongly recommend talking to some CREDIT UNIONS (not banks) to find a way to refinance this.

Additionally, for those where it's relevant, there was an additional global market shock component, including things like treasury rate spikes and dollar strength.     I'm not sure what you're referring to, but what risk could be worse than the above economic scenario? And for what reason would *anyone* even want a worse economic scenario?",Swap notional isn‚Äôt a very helpful risk metric. Makes for great headlines at click-bait mainstream sources that have no clue what they are talking about though.,"What do you mean? Swaps are derivatives. How do you hide derivatives in other derivatives?    Regardless, the stress tests are supposed to account for swaps by measuring their collateral obligations to the relevant central clearing parties, and then determining how those obligations could potentially adversely affect their Tier 1 capital ratios.",Except all the lobbying to get them rolled back to low regulation.,"Firstly, you failed to answer any of my questions. I'll  restate them in a more direct manner:   How are derivatives hidden in derivatives?   Are you talking about notional?   &gt;Dog shit wrapped in cat shit   Sure, I know the reference. However, *what* is the dogshit wrapped in catshit? Surely you cannot be talking about the CDOs from the GFC, as:  a) proprietary trading is all but dead on the sell side after 08  b) these stress tests were implemented directly because of the CDOs you're referencing after 08 (Basel III aka Dodd-Frank as it's called in the US) and  c) CDOs aren't swaps, nor do they hide derivatives. CDOs (in your reference) are a bunch of MBS stacked together with the goal of negative correlation. That's not hiding anything. It's just amalgamation.   d) if you mean CDS (which at least are swaps, but not what your 'dogshit wrapped in catshit' reference was referring to in the movie), I still don't see how that is hiding anything. There is still a defined underlying in a CDS, and afaik that underlying isn't another derivative (although I guess you could theoretically get extremely exotic by doing an inverse CDS on a CDS Index, however that's so rare it might as well not exist due to the difficulty it would take finding a counterparty).     So again, what is hidden in what? How is thia 'dogshit wrapped in catshit' akin to MBS tranches stacked into CDOs circa 2006-2008? What is this mysterious risk factor that all post-2008 regulations are somehow missing? And if the supposed house of cards is collapsing, why are the banks trying to increase their dividends and offload billions in excess capital (read: money) back to shareholders, as opposed to cutting dividends to save capital (again read: money) to cover potential losses the way they did in Dec 2019-Mar 2020 (the last time they were completely panicking about their ability to stay solvent)?","I‚Äôm just trying to understand better so please don‚Äôt take my question the wrong way. I gather you‚Äôre knowledgeable about these things based on your comment. My question is, in these studies, how much is hard math and how much is human judgment/assumptions that leads to the conclusion? For example, if I‚Äôm doing a study about how long a ball will take to hit the ground if I drop it from 10 meters up , there‚Äôs very little/no judgment but all math. While if I‚Äôm trying to estimate how many tomatoes were to sell if price went up by 10%, there‚Äôs less math and more judgment. If I‚Äôm trying to guess what Color shirt my boss will wear tomorrow, that‚Äôs gonna be much more judgement, much lesser math?  In my head there are too many correlations and elasticities that go into such studies and same input data can be used to say whatever the boss wants to hear.","The risk I see pretty clearly is the commercial real estate bubble, I don't see even a 40% decline in commercial rents making the vacancy rate return to pre-2020 levels. I don't know enough about it to tell you who or what is propping it up right now, but I do know the vacancy rate is higher in some places than anyone is admitting, OR someone is fudging the real numbers by a bit.      I don't think anyone *wants* a bad scenario, but I can tell you that many of the more conservatively invested rich would massively benefit from it, a recession/depression is a fire sale if you've got liquidity.","I suggest you take your own advice. Here's a great article with chat logs, emails, and even recorded phone calls from the last 72 hours of Archegos:   https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-bill-hwang-archegos-collapse-timeline/?utm_medium=deeplink    Yes, there's a lot of holes in risk management that Archegos exposed, but even that was over 3 years ago. Since then, there's a reason why TRS (Total Return Swaps, which were the instruments Archegos  used to bet on Viacom, Tencent, and Discovery) require higher disclosures and almost triple the collateral compared to an Interest Rate Swap or Credit Default Swap nowadays.    Additionally, Credit Suisse wasn't the only bank that got burned by Archegos. Others, including UBS (who took over CS) were also badly burned, yet they survived. Meanwhile, there were some prime brokers (banks of whom Archegos was a client the same as CS) like Goldman Sachs and Jeffries, who were unscathed almost entirely.    As for the records being sealed for 50 years, that's just the Swiss government protecting their banking industry. It's one of their most important, if not the most important, sectors for their economy. Of course, they weren't going to let the contagion from the 2022 banking crisis spread to UBS. Additionally, two points:   A) While Archegos was definitely a factor for Credit Suisses collapse, I would argue that safe haven treasuries (namely US Treasuries) prices in conjunction to risk free rates in early 2022 were a much larger factor   B) Credit Suisse (and UBS), never had to undergo the same risk management reforms after 2008 that the other G-SIB (globally systemically important banks) had to. That is Basel III (or Dodd-Frank as it's called in the US). Reason being they never took taxpayer money like the others did. They took money from the middle east (namely Saudi Arabia) to avoid that additional regulatory scrutiny instead. One could point to how the banks bound by the tighter regulatory burden escaped Archegos, as proof those regulations are working.","Fair question.   It's majority math, but because these things are trying to predict the unknown, there is some judgment. However, the baselines they use for the risk factors (like how they determined 10% spike in unemployment is enough of a stress test) based on historical data and then using statistics to extrapolate. For example, if we took all changes in unemployment and plotted them on a graph, then a 10% spike would be roughly 6 standard deviations from the mean on a bell curve. Repeat for every other variable in the stress test.    Once they have those figures, they can take a look at a bank's capital reserves, current risk outstanding, assets such as loans, collateral obligations that aren't tier 1, etc and combine it all into a model that factors all of the above. That model will produce a range of outcomes, and if that range of outcomes falls entirely within the value the bank can absorb, they pass. If it doesn't, they need to start increasing their Tier 1 capital reserves ASAP and redo the stress test."

In May of 2020, a pop-up medical-supply company run by political insiders found itself under federal investigation for failing to provide $457 million worth of masks to California‚Äôs government.  But the story of Blue Flame Medical is a stranger one and is now in front of one of the country‚Äôs top financial regulators.

Foreign companies wishing to enter the Chinese market have been compelled to manufacture locally, relinquish 51% ownership to a Chinese partner, often aligned with the CCP, and transfer their intellectual property to this partner.  In response, Western nations should adopt similar measures for Chinese companies accessing our markets. We should require Chinese firms to establish operations locally, mandate 51% ownership by local entities, and enforce IP transfer. This approach mirrors China's long-standing practices.  China should be able to compete under these conditions without complaint, as it has imposed similar requirements for the past 40 years. The EU should consider raising tariffs to 100%, in line with the USA. China's support of Russia has enabled ongoing destruction and war crimes in Ukraine, and both nations are responsible for widespread disinformation and propaganda in our media. It‚Äôs time to remove China's influence from our markets.  China has chosen to align with Russia, Iran, and North Korea, viewing the West as an adversary. It is crucial for us to acknowledge this reality and adjust our policies towards China accordingly.  China‚Äôs state-backed subsidies to its industries create an unfair competitive landscape, undermining Western manufacturers. Enforcing similar regulations would help level the playing field, ensuring fair competition.  Additionally, intellectual property theft by Chinese entities remains a significant issue, with substantial economic losses for Western companies. Requiring IP transfers from Chinese companies could mitigate this problem and protect our technological advancements.  Environmental concerns also warrant stricter measures. China‚Äôs lax environmental regulations and carbon-intensive manufacturing processes have led to significant global pollution. By compelling Chinese firms to adhere to our standards, we can promote more sustainable practices.  Finally, national security concerns arise from the integration of Chinese technology into critical infrastructure. Insisting on local ownership and IP transfer would provide greater oversight and security, protecting our interests against potential espionage and cyber threats.

finance,Jun,1d8nzsc,Bill Hwang looks to add Morgan Stanley probe to Archegos trial defense,,"*June 3, 2024 By Bloomberg News*  Bill Hwang is pushing to bring up the probe of Morgan Stanley block-trading leaks in an attempt to bolster his defense.   Lawyers for Hwang have asked the judge to be allowed to question a Securities and Exchange Commission official about the agency‚Äôs investigation of Morgan Stanley. That probe was into information leaking in connection with the New York-based firm‚Äôs block-trading practices during the time it was a counterparty of Archegos.   Prosecutors have relied on Carmen Taveras of the SEC as an expert witness as it tries to prove that Hwang engaged in market manipulation that helped catapult his wealth to more than $36 billion before losing it all in the span of a few days in March 2021. Morgan Stanley executed more than $5 billion of block trades for Archegos in the days before all the family office‚Äôs counterparties pushed to liquidate Hwang‚Äôs portfolio after the precipitous drop in the value of his biggest bets.  Justice Department prosecutors have sought to paint Hwang‚Äôs use of swaps as a deliberate attempt to quietly corner big positions in companies and manipulate the market for those stocks. Hwang, however, has described his reliance on such contracts as an attempt to avoid attracting public attention to his bets ‚Äî to prevent other market participants from attacking his positions if his wagers became public.   ‚ÄúWe believe that such inquiry is relevant and necessary for the defense to establish the legitimate reasons why Mr. Hwang and Archegos sought to maintain the secrecy of their positions,‚Äù Barry Berke, a lawyer for Hwang wrote in a letter to the judge overseeing the case. The aim would be to ‚Äúrebut the implication of Dr. Taveras‚Äôs testimony that Archegos used secrecy in order to facilitate manipulation.‚Äù  Federal prosecutors argued against the line of questioning, stating they‚Äôd already told Hwang‚Äôs lawyers that the block trades executed in Archegos‚Äô final week were not part of the investigation.  A multi-year investigation into block trading across the industry culminated in January after Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $249 million to the Justice Department and the SEC. The probe faulted Morgan Stanley for giving hedge funds advance warning as clients planned to sell slugs of stock big enough to move market prices. The Justice Department and the SEC said bank employees doled out the information, with the expectation that hedge funds would short the stocks and position themselves to buy parts of a block once it hit the market.  Hwang‚Äôs lawyers also cite a call recording produced by the prosecution that was obtained from the Morgan Stanley investigation where an executive at Citadel tells a Morgan Stanley banker ‚Äúyou took out Bill Hwang with the Viacom.‚Äù  The Morgan Stanley executive replied: ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù"

Here's the scenario as it stands so far: the company (""MPR"") is a railroad and is about to introduce a super-premium train service for perishable traffic from coast to coast. (This will lead to the CEO being arrested for aiding insider trading, but that's not the important part here.) I need to figure out what scenario would be realistic, in that it can avoid SEC scrutiny for at least a year.  1. New train service is actually a front for money laundering. The problem here is that the cars have to be loaded in one direction and empty for the return, and skilled locomotive engineers know for sure when train weight does not match their papers. The ""shipper,"" therefore, has to be able to ship actual product. That shipper could still be a front financed by the railroad, but I don't think the logistics make this reasonable.  2. MPR adds the revenue for the new service twice in its books - once in the overall revenues for the company, and again on its own line. Without a full audit, this should not be noticeable to shareholders, but the railroad's bank might catch on. I also have to figure out how this doesn't wind up hurting executives' compensation packages.  3. I could go with a real-world scenario, where the railroad was actually double-entering expenses for a certain line it wanted to get rid of. In the railroad I've created, though, there is plenty of traffic and it would seem very unreasonable for the line to not be profitable.  I'm also toying with the idea of making this a CSX parallel, from when hedge fund TCI launched a proxy fight in 2008 simply because CSX's operating ratio and safety record were pretty bad. But since I also want the finance VP to be corrupt and complicit, I feel like there needs to be something else involved.   I have no experience in this field, and I'm definitely not looking to make a quick buck here.

Florida conservatives feared financial institutions would take party membership or political ideology into account when making financial decisions, such as denying loans because the applicant was a registered republican despite being well qualified otherwise.  Treasury is concerned a ban on such governmental factors will interfere with anti-corruption efforts (local and state) and compliance with anti-money laundering checks at the international level.  If you suspect a foreign sanctioned party is trying to obtain financing in the US or a politician is depositing large irregular sums, you may fear state reprisal or penalties for checking this now illegal non-financial factor.",Of course they don‚Äôt explain how.,"I actually read the article to address the ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù any conservatives here may have for ‚Äúgovernment overreach‚Äù, and it‚Äôs obviously an appeal to conservative thinking when they address it as a ‚Äúnational security‚Äù concern.  What they really want is for banks to consider whether or not your business decisions will have a negative impact on the local environment and what social issues that exist in that area will be affected by your business decisions. You know, like what a real community should be concerned about.  Which I‚Äôm in full agreement with the Treasury on that aspect. Your business decision to create a something like an inkjet printer production company in Florida with ZERO plans on how you‚Äôre going to safely and sustainably remove the hazardous byproducts is irresponsible as fuck.  If you‚Äôre developing materials with hazardous byproducts like with inkjet materials heavy with VOC‚Äôs and you just decide to stick with the easiest and cheapest solution to dump it all in the public sewer system to let ‚Äúthe government‚Äù handle it, that should be taken into serious consideration by bank loaners as something that could bite them in the ass when they loan out their cash.  This not only covers the banks ass if/when the EPA comes in to audit that inkjet production business, but it also guarantees no dumbass is going to come in and think they can just do whatever the fuck they want with no repercussions.  What Desantis did was fucking retarded. He not only gave anyone with enough money to start their own business the power to do whatever the fuck they want, but he also fucked over his voters by removing the protections granted to them under the federal agencies like the EPA.  Completely. Utterly. Fucking. Retarded.","Sorry but this is more of a ""what"" than a ""how""",[deleted],When the FEDs fine them for non-compliance they can't just tell them fuck off and cite the state law.¬† They'll have to go to court and argue that the state law prevented them from following federal law (BSA/AML).,"There are 17 comments total here, yours isn't even negative, and the most downvoted comment is in support of DeSantis preventing this kind of government overreach. Are you sure it the magatards and Russians who are at work here?",Easy - FL banks can tell the feds to fuck off or simply not respond and cite the state law.,"The courts have long held that the commerce clause prevents states from passing laws that will unduly intrude on interstate commerce. A law like this seems to violate that premise and is unconstitutional. This makes sense because if we had every state trying to regulate its own economy in ways that interfered with interstate commerce we would cease to have a functioning economy. It would be death by regulation. (There is some irony here in that republicans are pushing these regs.) Also, the Supremacy Clause of the constitution says that the state law can‚Äôt conflict with the federal law - the federal law is Supreme.   So Florida goes and passes laws that are patently unconstitutional to the extent they prevent a party from complying with federal law. Creating this legal morass was almost intentional because DeSantis just wanted headlines, he doesn‚Äôt care that he passed an unconstitutional law whose only impact is to lead to business uncertainty and eventual years worth of litigation. It‚Äôs a big waste of everyone‚Äôs time to ‚Äúown the libs.‚Äù   How about fixing the rickety homeowners insurance situation in the state instead as its climate risk skyrockets. Oh but that‚Äôs right, Floriduh also passed a law making it illegal to blame climate change for things. Another patently unconstitutional provision. The GOP has no interest in actually governing."

Example with a $500k mortgage:   7.375% is $3072 a month   6.5% is $2708 a month  3072-2708=364 a month difference   7383 down / 364 a month = 20.2 month breakeven  So for a $500k mortgage, you are saving money every month past the 20 month mark. This could change slightly based on paying down principal over the 20 months, just this is just a rough idea.","One point is usually 1% of the loan amount, so I would assume the mortgage is $295k. The difference for a 30 year would then be $2037 - $1850 = $187 a month.    The $7,383 could alternatively be invested in a HYSA at 4% interest, good for about $25 a month. So $187 - $25 = $162 difference per month.   $7,383 / $162 = 45.6 months breakeven using different figures.","I would say it's a no brainer to not buy the points unless you don't want to ever refinance.

So, you deposit the suspicious check, and later, you see that it actually cleared your account.   Surely it can't be a scam, you think, the bank actually posted the check to your account.

So here you can see what I‚Äôm looking at. Puts on Nike. So yes, I believe it will go down so I want to make the bet that it will go down. So if I buy 1 contract, (which is 100 shares) I only pay the .81 per share? Do I already have to own the 100 shares in order to sell them?   It says my max loss is 81 dollars. So that‚Äôs it‚Äôs? I just need to make sure I have the 81 in my account by the time the option expires and Nike is above the ‚Äúbreak even‚Äù? And I gain money if the price of NIKE continues to decline?   Thank you.",If it's confusing don't try it till you understand it.,"You are making a bet that NKE will be worth $73 ***or less*** on or before 7/26/24. If that happens, you have secured yourself the right to sell 100 shares of NIKE stock at $73.  You profit (for a put option) is as follows:  `profit = MAX(0,strike_price - stock_price) - option_cost`  When they say your ""maximum loss"" is $81, that cost is a ***sunk cost*** you've already paid for at purchase of the option. In other words, the option can only make you additional money, it cannot cost you any more money.  You are ultimately hoping that the price of NKE goes downward.  If NKE goes to $73, you are ""at the money"" and will begin making money if it continues to go down, albeit you'll still not have covered the cost of your option yet.  If NKE goes to $72.19 (= $73 - 0.81), then you are at the ""breakeven"" point. The profit of the option position itself is now equal to its cost, which means you are at a net profit of $0 at this point. Any additional decline in NKE's price will be pure profit.  ***This all assumes that the option is either held to a worthless expiration or exercised profitably.*** Options trading itself, where buying/selling the underlying is not intended, is a different ballgame entirely.","Yes but you need to see the underlying cost being so cheap.  Market isn't stupid, options is that cheap because it's unlikely to happen.  There'd have to be something catastrophic the occur for the price to swing as wild as the contract suggests.  In other words, you're throwing $80 in the trash.","&gt; Calls you want the price to raise, puts you want the price to fall.   That depends if you are long or short the option. In some cases you may even want it to remain relatively flat.  &gt; What bothers me is the stories of people offing themselves because they think they lost everything? How does that mistake happen?  They are doing different trades than you are.  For example let‚Äôs say someone Sells a naked Call for NKE expiring 7/5/24 @ 2.00 with a strike price of 80$.  They make $200 and say they are willing to sell 100 shares of NKE at 80$ per share. Now all of a sudden something crazy happens and NKE shoots up to $1000 and the option is executed. You now have to go buy 100 shares at $1,000 and then sell them for $80. You now lose $92,000.   This is an extreme example but the more options you hold the less extreme it would have to be.  This is one of many many ways you can lose a lot of money all at once.",Just to make sure you understand it‚Äôs not a loss of 80 dollars or will gain 7k. It‚Äôs a maximum of 7k so 7k is the best you‚Äôll get. My advice don‚Äôt trade options if you don‚Äôt understand because you are correct people have lost their life savings and their lives not understanding how these work,"Put and call options can expire worthless, so if you‚Äôre betting everything you have on something that then doesn‚Äôt happen, well then you lose all your money  I take my 100,000 I‚Äôve saved up and buy call options, but the underlying stock doesn‚Äôt surpass the strike price and suddenly I‚Äôm out 100k with nothing to show for it",Yep. You have to get approved for various option levels with your brokerage though.,"it happens more when you sell/write uncovered options, among other things","That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Trying to gather more info on it. I understand the basics. Calls you want the price to raise, puts you want the price to fall. What bothers me is the stories of people offing themselves because they think they lost everything? How does that mistake happen?","&gt;So it sounds like I still need to have the money in the account to buy the 100 stocks, yes?  Why? You're selling the stock, not buying it.  &gt;Also, let‚Äôs say the opposite happens. I acquire this put but the price of the stock goes to 100 by the time of expiration. What happens then?  Your options expire worthless. You're out $81. For all prices &gt; strike price, profit = 0 - option cost = -$81. For all prices where $72.19 &lt;= price &lt;= $73, your profit will be: 0 &gt;= profit &gt;= -$81. All other prices result in profit &gt; 0."

finance,Aug,1eo51c9,The Great Wealth Transfer is set to be a $90 trillion disappointment‚Äîespecially for millennials,,Their worldview is also entirely understandable given that they grew up during a 45 year period where the threat of global nuclear annihilation was not only real but like a daily visceral fear. Hard to really blame them if you step out of your own worldview for a second.,Exactly. You‚Äôre pointing out one of the major blind spots of the younger generations ‚Äî an inability to see things from the other‚Äôs point of view and a black and white view of reality. Not defending boomers but every generation has their faults and keeping this in mind is important.,"It's funny you say that because we are on the edge of ww3 with even crazier weapons than the cold war and arguably closer to real conflict too. Kids today have it worse in every single way but of course they are held accountable for ""blind spots"" to the past when really we should be holding previous generations accountable for their blind spots in the future. America is falling, and it's the boomers fault. They still run everything. And they've lost their minds and cognitive abilities and reasoning skills much faster than they're losing capital. The younger generations are fucked. The old generations already won.",[removed],"‚ÄúCorporations‚Äù can just as easily make money off of millennials as boomers. Boomer wealth is going to old age support because modern healthcare means people live much longer past the age where they‚Äôre able to work. Boomers are spending their retirement savings on healthcare, housing, etc.","Here‚Äôs the thing that older generations understood that todays generations seem not to:  Nobody is coming to save you. You are on your own. It isn‚Äôt the governments job to take care of you. It isn‚Äôt the older generations job to shepherd you throughout your entire adult life. The problems you face are not of anyone else‚Äôs making but your own and you are responsible for you. What happens in your life is not someone elses fault, the system isn‚Äôt out to get you.   You have agency. You have free will. You can literally do ANYTHING you want to do. But nobody is gonna do it for you.",Bloody millennials,"Boomers commit their money to food, shelter, and healthcare. This last category is where all the money goes. That happens either directly when boomers spend money on healthcare themselves, or indirectly where the government collects higher taxes to pay for healthcare for boomers. Social Security and Medicare are extremely expensive programs. Then because that healthcare enables them to live longer, they pay for more food and shelter.","I am probably from that older generation myself. I disagree.      SOME people ARE certainly oppressed, maybe you aren't. At this point we aren't even having a conversation, we are just talking to talk. Things are much harder for the youth of America today than when I was growing up. Just because a few things (mostly social changes like being gay) have gotten ""easier"" doesn't negate the rising rents, dropping life expectancy, rising suicide rates and the rampant corruption and financial scams that kids face nowadays.   I understand people have free will and personal agency. Not sure why you are telling me that. It's redundant in this interaction. I am talking about widespread systemic change that has occurred, which takes a lot of those things out of the equation in a sense, or lessens their weight within it, if you know what I am trying to say. Personal agency matters less and less in a world that is increasingly defined by the circumstances of your birth. I have watched entire generations live and die now.  I think a lot of people would disagree that the present is ""better."" Life has not gotten better for everyone, not by a longshot. Maybe it's gotten better for you?       You just said keep a balanced perspective and then immediately spoke in a huge assumption, representing it as an absolute. It's hard to take that seriously.  Weren't you just talking about only being able to see things in black and white?  Take your own advice, keep a balanced perspective! And thank you for the discussion, good talk!",Yay
finance,Aug,1ex2i7j,Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter Takeover Is Now the Worst Buyout for Banks Since the Financial Crisis,,Loaning to charlatans. I hope their shareholders hold them accountable.,I wonder how many analysts who worked on this project were metaphorically bashing themselves in the head as they watched their superiors greenlight the world's biggest financial bonfire.,"They wanted to loan and then sell the debt making profit in fees. But no one wants to buy elons debt. Good, fuck those banks.",I think they were referring to the banks shareholders..   Elon still seems to think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with X (formally Twitter)‚Ä¶ ohh the irony,"Worth noting is that they're talking about the bank's ability to sell off the loans, but in the meantime they're still collecting above rate interest payments   &gt;The banks‚Äîwhich also include¬†[Barclays](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UK/XLON/BARC),¬†[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JP/XTKS/8306),¬†[BNP Paribas](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/XPAR/BNP),¬†[Mizuho](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JP/XTKS/8411)¬†and¬†[Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FR/XPAR/GLE)‚Äîhave been able to collect hefty interest payments from the X loans. They are generally for seven to eight years and carry rates several percentage points above the benchmark for investment-grade companies. And the banks could still ultimately be made whole if X is able to cover its interest obligations and repay the principal when the loans mature.  &gt;‚ÄúAt some price, they could sell it at a loss, but with Musk they could end up receiving 100 cents on the dollar, if things pan out,‚Äù said Kaplan.","Im imagining some of this was cross-sell for access to things like space X and Tesla. I also imagined they made a killing off the options they sold to him.   But yeah, they probably lost out altogether.",![gif](giphy|Q09lToTa0H3Es),tragically they'll lean on us to make up the difference,They don‚Äôt care. Those analysts already got paid for completing the transaction.,"Ya, there‚Äôs nothing in the article about missing payments or anyone losing money. It‚Äôs all about the banks want to be liquid cash to loan to everyday people I‚Äôd assume at a higher interest rate than X‚Äôs loan rate. It‚Äôs just an opportunity cost loss"

Not impossible but pretty unlikely.    Cleveland Fed inflation now cast has it at 0.23%","Inflation is at 2.9%... that's still not even close to 2% from the perspective of the last three decades. He's calling victory too early. With the dramatic political uncertainty, they won't be able to tell whether it's the interest rate cut or the politics that is driving things in the economy from here until November.

SHOCKED. üòê","If Kroger was price-gouging, why didn't Walmart lower their egg prices and steal all of their clients?","Lol stop, Kroger has 2% operating margins. You might be able to fool r/all but the finance subreddit can actually read a 10K and is smart enough to know grocery is a highly competitive category with structurally low margins and weak pricing power. If you want to blame someone, blame the food brands with 20-30% margins.",Based on these comments. I‚Äôm concerned about the future of finance.  But silver lining: the competition might not know basic economics.,"They have $150 billion in revenue. Even if their management team cost $100 million (which it doesn‚Äôt) that would only be 0.7% margin impact. It‚Äôs not like cutting executive pay would result in some magical margin uplift.  Amazon had zero profits on paper because it was unprofitable when it was starting up - they were investing in front of growth and willing to be loss making to grow faster, it wasn‚Äôt an accounting trick they had negative cash flow. Kroger has been around 100 years and it has always been a tough business.","This was the actual problem.  This price inflation above inflationary pressures was happening at every level of the market of CPGs.  Suppliers, Distributors and Retailers were all doing it independently, while simultaneously all blaming each other's price gouging as the reason THEY had to price gouge.","&gt; the finance subreddit can actually read a 10K  Bold assumption, based on the comments","Against price gouging but how do you define 'more than needed'  If milk costs $4 everywhere else did they charge $5? Or $8? Someone else could say they were comping their prices to Whole Foods milk.  To attack ""more than needed'"" is to attack everything about capitalism and the wrong targets   Healthcare and childcare inflation is far far higher and more important than spilt milk. And where you can buy water instead of milk, you are all but forced with a gun to your head to buy healthcare insurance. And their efforts to extract surplus value from consumers is much more concerted among a few colluding major players and lines of red tape  But no one is dragging them to Washington committees.   Easier to go after milk. But far less important","They have $150 billion in revenue and $3 billion in profit, a 2% operating margin. Their CEO earned $15.5 million, or 0.01% of revenue. It had no meaningful impact on their margins, it‚Äôs a rounding error. Save your bullshit for the subs with lemmings who will listen."

Medical debt can be purchased by collections agency‚Äôs for penny‚Äôs of their value.  This debt means the person hasn‚Äôt paid and the hospital has written off and is selling the debt.  John Oliver did a great example of this when he purchased $15million of debt for $60k which is 0.004% of its original value.  With that math the government could easily spend 50 million and wipe out over 12 BILLION in debt for millions of people. That‚Äôs a very easy win with minimal spend.
finance,Aug,1f45zam,Private Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports,,I sincerely don‚Äôt understand how wealth extraction on this level can even be sustainable in the long run. Parents who have zero interest in seeing their children move on to professional sports are not going to commit to the spending that these firms seem to be going after.  Way more kids are just going to be turned away from this activity than those who end up doing it. Rent seeking behavior on this level is going to be the death of our society. How did we get to the point where we do not see the public benefit to having free access to recreation? Especially for children,"Sucking the life out of the middle class, one activity after another.",Great example of Capitalism failing all of us.,"My third grader is in club soccer.

My wife is super supportive and kids are probably better for it.,"Yeah, I don't think he's really complaining. Just noting how ""net worth"" figures can be pretty misleading.  &gt; ‚ÄúYou know, at one point I had a lot of money on paper,‚Äù Foley, who cofounded Peloton in 2012 and was at its helm for a decade, told the New York Post.  &gt; &gt; ‚ÄúNot actually [in the bank], unfortunately. I‚Äôve lost all my money.

My kids are probably better for it, if we‚Äôre keeping it real.‚Äù &gt; &gt; Though Foley has lost much of his fortune, the ordeal has not extinguished his ambition. &gt; &gt; Within a year of resigning from the top job at Peloton, he had raised $25 million for his new venture, a direct-to-consumer rug company called Ernesta.","I used to work for Peloton. Talked with Foley a couple times. He was very much all in on Peloton and truly believed in the company‚Äôs continued success. The pandemic put leadership in an impossible position and doomed the company - at least for a while - they‚Äôre trying to make a comeback.   All that to say, I would very much believe that he - for the most part - didn‚Äôt diversify out of Peloton stock. Although there are public filings of his stock sales so it wouldn‚Äôt be difficult to find out how much he sold.   Buying and selling his $55M mansion within like a year is pretty indicative of his all-in belief in Peloton and subsequent lack of funds to support keeping the mansion",Oh no the horror of downsizing from the $55m mansion and having to buy the awful $20m one,"A lot of these founders take out loans against their shares to create liquidity while avoiding selling shares and losing control or creating the perception they‚Äôre cashing out among investors. Given how high the stock got to, he could easily have $100-200m in debt against his position. And keep in mind he‚Äôs charged interest on that so while Peleton stock is falling and he has no income, he‚Äôs accruing $5-10m in interest expense per annum.  And he was living big with that borrowed money. He had a $55m hamptons property - that‚Äôs $2-4m of mortgage per annum with another $1m in operating costs / taxes. He also sold that for a $4m loss in 2023. He had a west village townhouse that he renovated which he was forced to sell.

Though they‚Äôre receiving interest payments on the loans, some are so desperate to offload that they‚Äôve marked the loans down by hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the WSJ.  Those things are pretty unrelated",This is r/LeopardsAteMyFace/ stuff.  Musk has long been a known quantity.  How is it bank execs aren't being fired over this.,Help me understand your POV. Are you saying that banks focus on interest only and not repayment of the principal?,"The banks doesn't really care about repayment, because: Their business is to take a fat fee for originating the loan, and parcel it out as bonds, then sell the dreck on to some suckers as ""high-yield bonds"" - or whatever the current fashion is.   Usually, they can do this. However, this deal was so well-known to be shit that they can't sell those bonds to anyone, so it is all sitting on their books, stinking up the place. Kinda like it's the naughties all over again.   Saudi, Russia and China don't care about bailing this deal out because they already got all what they wanted from Musk/Twitter, and the Saudis can just buy Twitter a lot cheaper at bankruptcy.",[deleted],"That's not how it works. The banks want to re-sell the loans. But they can't find any buyers.  This is a pretty common practice after they've recieved X amount in interest payments. The problem is that X is such a shit company that nobody wants to pay full price to buy the debt (and in turn get the interest payments).   This mean that the debt holder has to lower the to e.g. 90 cents per dollar or less, to attract a buyer.   Musk isn't getting out of the debt in any way what so ever. It's just who the interest payments go to that would change.",They are trapped underneath this loan that they were not able to resell because the Twitter deal was over priced to begin with on top of losing a lot of value due to management direction.    This is that classic scenario:  It‚Äôs a problem for you if you owe the bank several thousands of dollars. It‚Äôs a problem for the bank when you owe them tens of millions of dollars.,"His entire schtick is to over inflate his achievements and numbers to get more funding from investors and government.  Glad to see it‚Äôs coming to an end with twitter. His claims of ‚Äúbillions of user minutes‚Äù and ‚Äúmost valuable brand in history‚Äù are being laughed out.

From a social/economic perspective, this is inefficient and dumb.","yeah I only got $2trillion, i was pretty sad","Don't worry. Nobody is getting that wealth. It's all going to health care companies, and the house is getting seized by the government to pay the nursing home.","I'm a millennial. My parents made good money.

I hope they use every penny enjoying their lives and getting as much out of life as possible.  This is not a popular view on reddit: I think anyone who has expectations that their parents owe them an inheritance of any kind is abhorrent and selfish. Expecting someone to scrimp and live a worse life so that yours might be easier is inherently a self-centered point of view, and directing that at your parents, who have likely already spent a lot of money and time raising you, is particularly abominable.    Lot of entitled people in this thread and on this site.","The expectation of inheritance is actually worse than being self-centered.  In many cases it‚Äôs self limiting as well.  I‚Äôve known people with parents that had money who haven‚Äôt carved their own way in life, never worked hard, or never took a gamble to make something of themselves because they had it in the back of their mind they would be set through inheritance.

This happened with Obama‚Äôs subsidy in 2009.,"If everyone has $25k to start, no one has $25k.  The value of your money is always relative to how much everyone else has.  It‚Äôs not a tough concept to understand.","Not sure a subsidy is the right way to do this, there are a lot of ways to help first time homebuyers. Something like capping interest rates for first time buyers at 3% would work much better and have far more flexibility.","Stop it! Your knowledge of economics and historical trends shits in the face of a strong, black, woman president! /s  It‚Äôs ridiculous not only that she thinks this is a viable plan, but also that people in the US fall for these facades every single time. Or maybe those two things are linked and she‚Äôs just saying that to trick voters  There‚Äôs no such thing as free lunch. No matter what, the piper is getting paid whether that‚Äôs through more taxes or higher prices on goods/services",Remember what happened last time we made it easier for people who couldn‚Äôt afford homes to buy them anyway?,This is good for absolutely nobody‚Ä¶,Great! So people with no savings (can‚Äôt afford the down payment) are now homeowners. Hope the roof doesn‚Äôt break and now they can‚Äôt pay their mortgage. Wonderful.  Throwing govt money at a problem is almost never a good idea.,"Not even remotely the same. If the government drives a car into your home (or forcefully shuts down your business), compensation is due. And PPP was supposed to go towards wages. I thought it was bad policy but let‚Äôs not be dishonest here.  Nobody owes first time homebuyers.","Ah come on. I just bought my first house. Better complain/challenge it in court and fuck it up for everyone else. /s  In reality this is good for everyone, myself included. Giving more of the market flexibility to enter the market will drive up home values, so even if you‚Äôre not a first time buyer, you have nothing to complain about.","The difference here was that in 2008, people who couldn‚Äôt really afford homes were buying 2 or 3 or more homes and leveraging assets to do so. This stipend is for first time home buyers. It doesn‚Äôt work for investors buying up stock. It also isn‚Äôt a bait and switch adjustable rate mortgage- it‚Äôs a one time stipend to cover the costs associated with buying the house. The conditions of your home ownership aren‚Äôt necessarily going to drastically change between day one and year 10."

The two most commonly used curves (2/10 and 5/30) have both undergone significant steepening in recent weeks. 2/10 was about -32 bp at the beginning of July and is now -9 bp. 5/30 was about +20 bp and is now +48 bp.  It probably is actually an ominous sign for the curve to disinvert so quickly over the past few days. But looking at the relevant data would give that impression anyway (ISM manufacturing and NFPs, most prominently).",Considering how long it has been inverted we should have had two recessions that we haven‚Äôt had.,Yield curve inversion may be the most misapplied concept in markets. Literally the definition of pattern fitting. Why do we continue to use it or discuss it when current conditions make it basically useless.,"The inversion looks worse. I know it's been inverted for a while now, and it used to be a leading indicator of recessions but I thought it was notable just how much it keeps changing shape.","yeah, I noticed the PMI is still showing contraction",The shape is more inverted.,The economy is stabilizing still from the events related to Covid.

Can you explain why you think reducing the debt would put us in economic ruin?,"I‚Äôve always wondered, what was the point when we hit our first trillion? And also, what‚Äôs the point of no return on our debt? Andrew Jackson paid off our national debt and put us in economic ruin by doing so and that was like 200 years ago, what would our economy look like if the government decided to just try to pay the debt back","Just seems like we pile it up more than it gets paid back, considering it‚Äôs been increasing constantly, but I feel as though if we paid it back quickly enough to make a considerable dent in it at the point we‚Äôre at now we‚Äôd be in economic ruin for a century","I‚Äôm not the most educated on the subject, but I‚Äôd imagine having to pay everything back faster as well as cutting down our spending by a huge amount would have significant issues, if it was easy it would be done already is kinda what I imagine","Those are some big numbers.

finance,Sep,1fgzdem,"The US is considering a sovereign wealth fund. Alaska already has one, and it's funding a universal basic income.",,"The fund in Alaska is interesting, basically every resident gets an annual payment based on the price of oil, and everyone talks about it, whether it‚Äôll be good or bad this year. I spent some time in Fairbanks, which cured my desire to visit Fairbanks.","&gt; At the White House, President Joe Biden‚Äôs top aides have circulated plans for a fund to finance national security interests. And former President Donald Trump recently called for a similar state-owned investment fund to finance ‚Äúgreat national endeavors‚Äù during a campaign stop at the Economic Club of New York.  That‚Äôs not a sovereign wealth fund. A sovereign wealth fund is where a state sells nationally owned commodities (typically oil) and invests the profits in stocks, bonds, etc. then pays out profits to the country‚Äôs citizens as shareholders. Norway, the UAE, Alaska, etc. fit into this model.   What Trump and Biden are proposing is just a roundabout way of selling more Treasury bonds (increasing the national debt) and distributing funds to key swing state voters. It‚Äôs no different from issuing more Treasury bonds except there‚Äôs less bipartisan oversight.  &gt; It is unclear how an American fund would be funded or how it would operate.   No kidding.","I have never been to Fairbanks, but you have cured my desire to visit Fairbanks.",You are wrong. A sovereign wealth fund is an investment arm of a government that invests on behalf and returns to the citizenry. Singapore‚Äôs (GIC)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIC_(sovereign_wealth_fund)] is a good example and basically it‚Äôs like a government pension / PE fund. They invest in a shit ton of asset classes at home and abroad. I‚Äôve thought it‚Äôs dumb the uS hasn‚Äôt had one for the longest time because basically the capital is an allocation of taxes or government borrowing which gives you the cheapest equity in the world.,"I'm from Alaska but havent been there for many years. AFAIK, it's not just the oil but all exports from the state. And it's usually not that much (&gt;$2000) from what I remember.",That doesn‚Äôt sound like enough to absorb the additional costs associated with living in Alaska,"Totally sounds like a good idea and in no way shape or form could this be abused at the tax payers expense.   We don't need more wealth funding, we need more accountability on where our U.S tax dollars is already going.","Lol Fairbanks is cool! Don't visit in January/February unless you're looking for the 40 below experience, but Summers are nice, there's plenty to do outside, we have surprisingly good Thai food, several great breweries, and of course the northern lights.   Don't come to Alaska JUST to visit Fairbanks, visit Anchorage and the kenai peninsula as well. Take a glacier cruise, go on a fishing charter, go on a sled dog tour (winter), hike some awesome mountains (or bring your mountain bike). There are alot of cool things up here!","This is correct.  Whether it's a well conceived sovereign wealth fund is a different question, but this clearly would fit the basic definition.  I think the question is: are our assets (whether borrowed, found underground or otherwise) going to get a better return investing in stocks, bonds, etc. or investing in other ways (education, infrastructure, defense, whatever).  The structure of it is secondary to that question in my mind.",Which would increase the size of their economy and therefore the fund.   People moving to Alaska is exactly what they want.

After that I'll start benchmarking their budget against enforcement collections.,"https://taxfoundation.org/blog/irs-funding-plan-inflation-reduction-act/  It seems like they have a long ways to go before they can pay for, let alone make a profit, on the $80 billion. I‚Äôm sure they haven‚Äôt spent anything close to that so far though.  Does anyone know what additional money they have spent so far to recover that $1.3 billion.

There's a large amount of hiring done, and all of them need to be trained. That takes time and also pulls a good chunk of the regular workforce off the frontlines in order to train them. Plus, there's been a ton of attrition, and that's not going to stop.  In short, lots of people who knew what they're doing have left, leaving another large chunk behind to train the newbies. And that leaves just a fraction left to do the actual audit work to assess and collect that 1.3 billion.   It's way too early to calculate the ROI of this investment.

finance,Sep,1fjzmln,"Fed cuts rates by half a percentage point, cites 'greater confidence' on inflation",,"&gt; Interest rates were nearly 20% in the 1980s. 6% is very low still.  Interest rates don't exist in a vacuum, they're relative to the natural rate of interest.  Set it above that rate and they're high, below that rate and they're low.  They were high in the 80s but the natural rate was also pushing up close to 12% so it was necessary to beat things down.    Today R* is likely under 2%, so rates are still high.  comparing to periods in the past is pretty useless, especially given that the 80s were a true anomaly in the rate environment.  Prior to the oil crisis rates hovered around 4% for a long long time.    https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar  It is 100% objectively correct to say rates are still high today, and will still be high at year end even given the cutting schedule.  You could have a 150bps cut tomorrow and they'd still be high, all it means to say rates are high is that they're currently in a tight monetary condition - as long as they sit above the natural rate of interest conditions are restrictive or tight, once they go below that they're accommodative or low.",Can I go ahead and assume you're not capable of answering any of the questions I asked?  they should be easy for someone as knowledgeable as you...  e: LMAO immediately blocked.

What they should do instead is close the loophole that allows the ultra rich to avoid taxes by taking margin loans against their assets ad infinitum. You want to use your money? Great, realize it and pay taxes on it, mfer.   On the same vein, we need to regulate corporate stock buybacks.

finance,Sep,1fktnmh,Federal-funds rate the past 3 years + Fed officials' projections for the next 3 years (WSJ),,"Just FYI, anyone can access this info in real time via the federal reserve's website.  But also, you can access much more than this here in more or less real time: www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html  Right hand tab defaults to current, you can click through each meeting up top to see where probabilities are.    you can also click through probabilities to see the trajectory over time as implied by the probabilities.  Historical will give you exactly that, so you can see how sentiment and outlook has shifted over time.  Probabilities are directly calculated from FFR futures, so it‚Äôs more or less a direct measure of what smart money sees at any moment in time.   Dot Plot is what you're seeing above - it's the fed governor's aggregate outlook for rate changes.  As you can see comparing the futures to the dotplot the market expects a more drastic cutting shcedule than the governors are telegraphing.   It's pretty common for the futures to call bullshit on the dotplot, remember the dotplot is a signaling tool just as much as it's a gauge of current Fed outlook.  So governors may internally anticipate we'll be at ~3.75% by year end as the futures indicate, but signal a slower cutting pace in the dotplot to convey Fed willingness to keep rates higher for longer if conditions warrant.  Fed signaling alone can often have noteworty impact on business conditions and inflation so it's not arbitrary by any means.  Everyone in the industry is familiar with these tools, but I get the idea most of this sub has transitioned from industry folk to not that, so y'all might find it useful.  At the very least it should add some context why a lot of us are much more certain about what's happening with interest rates than others.",This sub has gotten so terribly low effort in the last 2-3 years.,"Who‚Äôs prediction?  What are you considering a prediction here?  nothing that I see would be considered a prediction in the industry, nor should anyone treat it that way.  For whatever reason a lot of people on Reddit misconstrue outlook with predictions, outlook is necessarily anchored in time and based on present conditions and available information, with the implicit assumption that everyone understands that new information over time can and will change outlook.  The dotplot is a graphical display of individual fed members present day outlook (public outlook, so obviously fedspeak is important here), the cme fedwatch is a probability calculation based on current futures pricing.  Neither of these are necessarily meant to predict anything, but just provide information surrounding present conditions.",I'm just going to leave this right here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1ael87q/oc\_us\_interest\_rates\_forecasted\_over\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1ael87q/oc_us_interest_rates_forecasted_over_time/),"This isn‚Äôt a model, it‚Äôs a summation of sentiment from governors.  Dotplot is a signaling tool, talking about it like it‚Äôs a predictive model kinda screams a significant lack of familiarity.  &gt; I would hope for 4% rate by the tail end of 2026 as a best case scenario.  R* estimates are sitting at like 2.5% or less right now, 4% for another 16 months would be severely constrictive in an environment where employment is already showing a supply mismatch, not sure if I follow?",&gt;Except the Fed funds rate has never come down on a gradual slope like that.  Bro has never heard of a trend line lol,For past 2 years***,"Not jaded, just kinda dumb.  It‚Äôs a dotplot, there‚Äôs nothing to ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù.  So the post doesn‚Äôt make sense for anyone who knows what they‚Äôre looking at.","Oh neato, you're doing the thing where you try to get super condescending with your language in the hopes that the other person finds it authoritative, fun!   Here, use [this one](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF), it's better for some reasons I'll outline below.    &gt;Historically, every single one of these drops has been on a much steeper slope than what is being projected.  So for one, your comment up there said the slope is rarely gradual, which implied that you didn't understand that cuts are done in irregular steps but the dotplot renders this via a trendline.  The dotplot has always used a trendline, that's how it works, everyone is aware that reality is generally not a smooth shift.      But, secondly, the reason why I wanted you to view the chart above is because it has those lil shaded areas on it that help with context.  Ya see, generally speaking when the fed begins a cutting cycle it's because we're entering a period of economic contraction, to that extent the severity of said contraction generally dictates the pace at which cuts occur.  The current situation is one of economic expansion, where the Fed ran FFR higher than R* in order to push back on inflation.  Given that, they generally have the leeway to reduce rates at a gradual pace because they are not facing economic contraction.  The long short is that you can't make assumptions about a cutting pace based on historical pace unless you're juxtaposing the conditions prevalent in those times to the conditions today.      Moreover, this is the dotplot, it's a signaling and sentiment tool.  The dotplot is quite often more optimistic or pessimistic than reality as reflected by futures.  That's because the Fed uses it to signal that their stance is to err on one side or the other of a given event.  Here the Fed is saying their sentiment leans towards maintaining a slower cut pace rather than a faster one.  To draw a comparison, in early 2021 the dotplots showed rates staying low for a prolonged period of time even though futures anticipated them rising faster.

So what CME is doing is graphically representing the aggregate sentiment of the institutional market - as reflected in their actual trades placed.  To that extent it‚Äôs rarely ‚Äúwrong‚Äù in the near term because participants typically are operating on as much information as possible.

Stagnant population means no underlying growth in core demand. Their industries and financial sector are slow, lumbering, bureaucratic nightmares rife with bloat without the agility or talent to compete with American or Asian enterprises. The law is completely hostile to capital - ridiculous labor laws making it impossibly expensive to fire people, zero motivation for innovation, no rewards for taking risks. The only thing they lead the world in is regulating everything they can touch to make it even harder to operate there.

The millionaires don‚Äôt actually live there. Their money and residency status does.,You're only going to get 1 condo around my area for that.,What's going on in the UK?,"The recently deposed Conservative government proposed some changes to the previously favourable tax treatment for so-called 'non doms' - someone who is UK resident but not tax domiciled in the UK. Historically people in this position would only be taxed on foreign earnings when remitted into the UK (at a simple level) and their non-UK assets were outside of their estate for inheritance tax purposes.  Conservatives proposed to change these rules to make them less favourable, new Labour government now proposes to go even further, most crucially removing most/all of the inheritance tax break. Also adding a 20% tax on private school fees (the UK, for all its faults, still has a pretty world class private education sector which wealthy parents around the world send their children to). All told, there is an assumption that to the extent taxes need to go up - and the consensus seems to be that they do - it'll be the millionaires and up that will pay the most additional. Given how much of tax receipts already come from the wealthy, some of those who can leave are doing so.  Add to this longer secular trends of British decline relative to the US and other places where it's attractive to be rich (notably Dubai, Switzerland, etc.). Then add in Brexit, which has generally made the UK poorer and a more tedious place to do business of the sort many millionaires probably do (especially finance, which formerly London was certainly Europe-leading), and to seem in some respects more inward-facing than it used to be.   Of course, it's not all doom and gloom, but these are some of the reasons.",Brexit!

The underlying problem is that we debased the currency. 80% of US $$$ came into existence since 2020. We went off the gold standard in '71 and saw a full decade of stagflation. Hell, they even played the same cat and mouse BS with interest rates back then. I'm not sure why we would expect different results this time. Its going to come down, then go back up, then come down, then go back up... and they are going to play with interest rates to make it look like they are doing something.   The reality is that monetary supply is a HUGE influence on inflation. And, inflation doesn't hit everyone all at once. For instance, your current mortgage doesn't cost you more, but if someone buys a house, they will see it. Or, say you are building something and interest rates aren't a factor... the labor still costs more, the materials still cost more... therefore, your building will cost more. You are seeing the first round of inflation. In the 70s we saw three rounds of inflation with a cooldown in between, each round being significantly more painful than that last.

Ford F-series 2. RAM pickup 3. GMC Silverado  Those are only the top 3, from a long list of large and overpriced cars that follow. Currently, 80% of all personal vehicles sold are trucks and SUVs while only 20% are cars/sedans. The number of people who constantly tell me that a truck/SUV is a necessity for everyone is wild. Especially when considering only 50% of vehicles sold were trucks and SUVs just 10 years ago. Its amazing how quickly something goes from a nice-to-have to an absolute necessity. The most affordable car in the US is the Nissan Versa, which at $17K brand new, does not even make it to the top 30 best selling cars in the country.  For comparison, the best selling car in Switzerland, a country with similar median income, is the Toyota Yaris.

With this hijacked supreme court I am quite pessimistic.","If they actually had some kind of competition then the profit margins wouldn't be so absurd. A competitor would be able to provide a similar service while making say 15% profit margin, making their service be undoubtedly cheaper and in turn attract more customers, drawing them away from Visa's. Also, since Visa has grown so large they may still be able to offer lower prices than competitors while having crazy high profit margins via economies of scale, which is what has probably helped them edge out any competition leading to, and sustaining, a monopoly in their market as no one can compete.","I‚Äôm sure this is gonna be downvoted, I‚Äôd like to imagine I‚Äôm knowledgeable ish, studying finance at a decent school, I understand the lawsuit, but in terms of consumer perspectives is this a common thought regarding to its relevancy pertaining to it being an actual problem for people?

The company was acquired by Brookfield in 2019 for $4.1 billion, with the asset manager piling on debt which has weighed down returns at the same time as profits have fallen.*  *Brookfield is widely regarded to have paid too much when it acquired Healthscope, and it could be argued the firm has contributed to the group‚Äôs difficult financial position.*  *As part of the purchase, Healthscope sold 38 properties to Toronto-listed Northwest Healthcare Properties Real Estate Investment Trust and leased them back. That too has increased costs, with the company now paying rent on those properties.*  *The Australian Financial Review can reveal Northwest Healthcare president Mike Brady told investors last month that Healthscope was ‚Äúhaving a few financial issues‚Äù, about which it was speaking to its lenders. ‚ÄúEach of their hospitals are profitable,‚Äù he said, according to a transcript. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not profitable enough for them.‚Äù*  *Under questioning, Northwest Healthcare chief executive Craig Mitchell said Healthscope had asked for rent relief, adding he was ‚Äúnot agreeable to that‚Äù.*  *Northwest Healthcare‚Äôs Australian property portfolio is worth $4.3 billion, and is some 51 per cent of its global assets, according to its most recent disclosures.*  *Private Healthcare Australia chief executive Rachel David, who represents insurers, said hospitals in areas of genuine need would not close.*  *She challenged Healthscope owner Brookfield to use its $1.4 trillion in assets to solve its own problems. ‚ÄúHealthscope is the one threatening to charge consumers more, not health funds.

Dimon‚Äôs message was straightforward: technology has enormous advantages that can enhance our lives, increase productivity and keep us healthy. But we shouldn‚Äôt dismiss the potential consequences that these developments will bring about. While AI will undoubtedly alter how people work, he believes this won‚Äôt necessarily result in a general loss of jobs. ‚ÄúIf it works for the customer and the client, we can kind of do more,‚Äù implying that successful businesses can continue to expand while assisting their employees in adjusting to these changes.   Instead of just accepting job losses, Dimon emphasized that companies and society need to find better ways to help those impacted by these changes. ‚ÄúWe have to find a better way to help the people who get hurt by it,‚Äù he stated. For its part, JPMorgan is committed to retraining and redeploying employees whose roles are affected: ‚ÄúWe love to retrain people, redeploy them, re-educate them.

finance,Oct,1g28oau,Thoughts on Bipartisan bill to remove lawmakers on buying and selling stocks ,"A bipartisan bill to ban lawmakers from buying and selling stocks aims to address potential conflicts of interest and enhance transparency in government. Here‚Äôs how this could benefit the American public:  Reduced Conflicts of Interest: By preventing lawmakers from trading stocks, the legislation could minimize situations where personal financial interests might influence legislative decisions.  Increased Public Trust: Such a ban could enhance public confidence in elected officials, as citizens may feel that lawmakers are acting in the best interests of their constituents rather than their own financial gains.  Level Playing Field: This could create a more equitable environment, ensuring that lawmakers are not privy to non-public information that could give them an unfair advantage in stock trading.  Focus on Governance: Lawmakers could concentrate more on policy-making rather than financial investments, potentially leading to more effective governance.  Strengthened Accountability: The ban could foster greater accountability, as officials would be less able to profit from insider information or market movements resulting from their legislative actions.  Overall, this legislation could promote integrity and accountability in government, benefiting the democratic process and public welfare.",Or a blind trust to let them take advantage of more complex investment strategies.,An easy fix would just be to limiting them to index funds and/or putting a 7 day delay on order execution,Guaranteed to not happen if it is Dem house and Senate.,"Neither party will support it, it‚Äôs virtue signaling at its finest.

In school you may need to know how to do it on a calculator because the professor isn't going to let you be on a laptop during exams, but it's cumbersome compared to a spreadsheet.  The core concept of time value of money is that money in the future isn't worth as much as money in the present, and TVM calculations let you translate how much something in the future (**FV = Future Value**) should be worth today (**PV = Present Value**) and vice versa.  It does this using an interest rate (**I%**), but depending on the context it could also be called the cost of capital, discount rate, etc. but it's just the rate at which you expect that money to grow for the level of risk involved.  The other variables are generally for calculating a loan, so total number of payments, number of payments per year, how many times it compounds per year, and how much each payment will be.  You can find tutorials all over youtube; the same formulas work in google sheets. The follow-on concept would be to learn how to make a discounted cash flow (DCF) -- TVM functions rely on everything being constant in every period (which works fine for loans), while DCF lets you determine the present value for the life of a project that has different amounts coming in or out in different periods."

However, the report found that Trump‚Äôs tax and spending plans could add twice as much to the national debt as those brought by Harris.  &gt;  &gt;The budget watchdog found Harris‚Äôs plans could add $3.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, compared to an estimated $7.5 trillion boost to the national debt from Trump‚Äôs plans.  &gt;  &gt;A majority of economists in the poll also said they anticipated higher interest rates under a second Trump term, with 61 percent of those surveyed saying as much.  &gt;  &gt;Forty-five percent of economists expect economic output to expand faster under Harris overall, compared to 37 percent who said the same for Trump, and 18 percent who ‚Äúsaw no material difference,‚Äù the Journal said.  &gt;  &gt;Moody‚Äôs Analytics also projected Trump‚Äôs economic agenda to add to inflation and slow the pace of growth in a July analysis."

The rate cut by the Fed applies to the Fed funds rate, which is the intra-bank overnight borrowing rate that banks rely on to manage their assets and liabilities. Most interest rates, including mortgage rates and credit card rates, are set by the banks and typically indexed to market rates.  The rate cuts would enable banks to borrow at a lower cost of capital and potentially make the same spread by charging lower interest rates to consumers and businesses, but the mechanism is still very much free-market driven.

The Federal Reserve has started a interest rate cut cycle and cut rates by 50 basis points, to per Google, 4.83% as of Oct 23rd. However, mortgage interest rates reportedly have gone back up to 7% and the market is pricing higher interest rates in to their equations now.      If this continues - this divergence - and the Federal Reserve keeps cutting while mortgages companies keep raising rates, could mortgage rates become like credit card rates where because there is no government regulation, credit card companies (and mortgage companies) can charge basically whatever the heck they want. Credit card interest is 30% now - and if the current administration and next president keeps a hands off approach to the mortgage industry, mortgages could conceivably creep up with time.      Other than ""good will"" - is there anything stopping mortgage rates from not being 30% like credit card rates unless the government or federal reserve lays the hammer of the law on them?",But what happens when everyone gets greedy? Could mortgage rates hit 30%?

The ruble‚Äîcurrently worth a fraction of a penny‚Äîhit lows on Wednesday not seen since the start of the Ukraine war.  The aim is to put a floor underneath the ruble and clamp down on further price pressure leaking into the country through the rising cost of imported goods. The Russian economy is also suffering from a lack of foreign investment caused by Western government sanctions that ban companies from doing business with Russia. With most Russian financial institutions now cut off from trading in dollars, this starves the country of a steady supply of U.S. currency reserves.  ‚ÄúThis decision is aimed at reducing volatility in financial markets,‚Äù the Bank of Russia said on Wednesday.  Official inflation rates hit a year-on-year peak above 9% percent in August, and continue to remain elevated. Russian political scientist Kirill Rogov believes these figures are likely understating the problem and actual rates could be materially higher, citing data from Raiffeisen Bank analysts and market research firm ROMIR.  The central bank‚Äôs announcement came one week after the U.S. government imposed fresh economic sanctions against Gazprombank.

Unfortunately even in his base of billionaires, the primary group are tech bro CEOs, MLMs, Crypto Bros, and all these scam grifting numbnuts that have multiple failed companies and little understanding of economics. And probably as close as you can get to apocalyptic fetishists.

And frankly as if the tarrifs and widespread tarrif use would crash the economy are bad enough, I am *extremely* concerned with the mass deportation which is fucking nuts.   Trump keeps upping the ante of 10M+ deportations when estimates have unauthorized illegal immigrants as under 10M. This is like *the* most *Nazi* shit imaginable.   For anyone not familiar with the Holocaust, the Final Solution was not the initial plan. The initial plan was for mass deportation. Trying to carry out mass deportations ended up crashing the economy to the point where the deportations became *economically and logistically unviable* so it was *easier* for the Nazis to commit *mass murder*.  I'm hoping that Trump and his new administration isn't going to be massively gung ho on mass deportations (I don't have much hope since the consistent thing they've done is made immigration hell with family separation), but a crashed economy from mass deportation is going to be the least of our worries.","Imagine calling Kamala, the most run of the mill economically conservative politician around, a commie.","No, actually we don‚Äôt know what Donald Trump will do because he‚Äôs not a particularly ideological person and he‚Äôs susceptible to personal flattery.

finance,Nov,1gt8mb1,Credit Suisse Survived a Bank Run Only to Succumb to Scandal,,"The forced merger/sale to UBS - kneejerk reaction because they were too afraid of a repeat of 2008, when the govt bailed out UBS (a hugely unpopular decision at the time - both for the govt and for UBS employees).   The govt could have nationalized CS with immediate effect - focus on settling the market jitters, help stem the outflow of client capital, and actually hire good mgmt in place that would focus on what was best for CS as a firm. Once you are comfortable with the reorg, float the firm back into the market again. Ideally, you've rescued one of your major banks, saved thousands of jobs, and maintained the dignity of one of your country's stalwart names. Oh, and just like you did with UBS 2008, you'll likely end up recouping the taxpayer money with profit!  Instead, they did a firesale to UBS (with significant backstops in case of losses - thankfully those never really came into play anyway). Now you have ensured that CS will never actually come back as a standalone firm, let UBS effectively have a monopoly on Swiss banking (and there's enough complaints with FINMA re their behaviour and fees etc with retail clients already), and the worst part imo - let UBS gut the whole CS biz, keep what they like, and lay off thousands (coming summer 2025) who won't have enough competitors to find roles in. You could even talk about the ripple effects throughout the country's economy from the death of a sizeable employer - businesses like catering services, IT, maintenance etc, who will all suffer from lack of work now.   One might say - well, that's how it goes when mergers/buyouts happen. Except, there is no way that FINMA or the Swiss govt would have ever let these 2 firms merge in the normal course of business - all the points mentioned above would have been seen as detriments to such a deal. So why do that now as option A?","RIP. The way this was mishandled by the Swiss government will have lasting consequences including on their own economy - but of course, the politicians in charge will be long gone by then.",&gt; The way this was mishandled by the Swiss government  What are you referring to specifically?,And this information of the collapse will be sealed for 50 years,"Fair points all of them.  \- While this is somewhat wishful thinking, the Swiss govt is not quite the same as the UK govt, when it comes to general efficiency and workability. It's not a crazy idea to nationalise - the US has done it successfully in the past. Certainly a better option than a forced fire sale to your direct competitor.   \- Possible. There were private investors, and we all watched the complete mess they made, because they were incentivised for THEMSELVES and not the bank's wellbeing. And frankly, they were quite shit at that too (eg, Herro, SNB). Second problem here - The Swiss govt was always interfering when it came to ""our country's crown jewels"" looking at foreign partners for mergers etc. They didn't want CS to be a part of an American/Asian/etc bank - hence the shit decision to marry them off to UBS. It's not like other suitors weren't good enough, it's that the government just chose the one Swiss suitor arbitrarily.   \- It's not disingenuous at all - for all the reasons mentioned before, and the explanations above. The decision to sell to UBS was driven solely by the government (the buyers themselves didn't really want to make the deal, but if you're giving it for effectively free....well), and done so with the intent of solving...something...for the super-short-term, while completely ignoring the irreversible consequences for the med/long term.","&gt;actually hire good mgmt  &gt;ideally  &gt;you'll likely end up recouping the taxpayer money with profit  Sorry this all sounds quite optimistic, idealistic and simplistic.   * Of course it would be nice to ASSUME the nationalisation would go well - but of course, it might not (e.g. the UK Govt's nationalisation of Northern Rock tied up their money for several years, and eventually they sold for a massive loss).  * If it would have been so simple for the Govt to turn the bank's business around, why did the private sector not do it? (Do private investors not care enough about running a profitable business?)  * Yes of course there are trade offs involved. But it's disingenuous to frame it as ""option A"" (I assume the real option A was something like exceptional liquidity assistance from the central bank).",I completely agree there are downsides and maybe overall you're right. But my overall point is that it would have been a tough call and they would get criticism no matter what they decided.,"Definitely, it seems like the Swiss government dropped the ball on this one.","Nationalizing the bank should only be done temp until it was turned around.¬†   Nationalizing may be the wrong term.

The change applies to workplace plans, including 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and most 457 plans, along with the federal Thrift Savings Plan.   ‚Ä¶ Starting in 2025, the 401(k) catch-up contribution limit will remain at $7,500 for savers 50 and older.

finance,Nov,1gvpspc,What would be the ramifications of forcing all companies to engage in a net yearly profit share with employees?,[removed],It doesn‚Äôt stick to those exact statistics but employee ownership like an ESOP or similar divides profits up.  I think they are the most realistic version of this.,It would cause investors to take a more hands on approach to running the businesses and becoming ‚Äúemployees‚Äù who also get a salary. I imagine companies would change their pricing scales and create nonprofits where companies would then decide to donate 40-whatever percentage of profits to. These non profits would obviously be ran by the same investors. Kinda like how Microsoft already does with the various nonprofits that bill gates owns and uses to keep his profits taxed as little as possible.,"So a few likely things off the top of my head:  * ""Profitable"" companies (which will depend heavily on how that is defined in the rules) will be able to lower salaries and still attract talent, while less profitable companies would need to raise salaries to compete.  I would expect this would lead to consolidation very quickly. * There would be a massive drop in people willing to start new businesses.  The proposition of: invest your life savings, work 100 hours a week for years, and then just maybe you might get to keep 20% of the profits your company makes is a hard sell.  Imagine a roofing company with 3 employees and one owner.  The employees would each end up with more of the profits than the owner. * Equities would pretty much plunge across the board, because value is being taken from those equities and given to employees. * There would be a continued flight from ""value"" sectors and companies to ""growth"" for investors (to the extent anyone invests in equities at all). * Inflation is certainly a real possibility, but exactly how that would play out I can't predict.  I don't think changes to the tax code would necessarily cure that, short of a 100% tax on profit sharing.  The resulting damage to the economy might counteract the inflation, though. * The same outsourcing that happened to manufacturing in the US would start happening to service sectors very quickly. * If companies get to choose how the profits are distributed, I expect it would make inequality worse.  If they don't, I expect it would make the issues above worse.","&gt;Imagine a roofing company with 3 employees and one owner. The employees would each end up with more of the profits than the owner.  Profit-sharing doesn't necessarily mean equally divided profit-sharing. Usually, when a company creates an ESOP, there is a defined portion of the equity allocated to that, I think.","ESOP's are great.  OP was specifically asking about forced sharing of 80% of profits, which is not that.","Oh wow yeah I didn't even catch that, yeah that would be difficult LOL","It sounds all fine and great until you have a familiarity of economics and how this would impact things on a macro scale. If we forget about the technicalities of how companies would evade this rule, we would observe companies having much less capital (money) to invest in positive net present value projects. (Think of this as companies investing to make even more money in the future. A great example is all the companies investing into AI right now.)  This capital would be rerouted to the hands of individual people (who are known to be more risk averse than institutions). These individuals only have so many choices for how to invest their money, (e.g. stocks, bonds etc). However now, stocks would no longer be able to provide the same return as these companies are no longer able to invest in their future as they previously saw fit. You know how the S&amp;P returns an average of ~7% a year? This average yearly return would fall dramatically. While the return seems like just a number, investing in companies is a method of giving them money that can eventually propel innovation. When the stock market is now only returning 4 or 5% a year, there is less reason to put money into it compared to say- bonds. Without this form of investment, innovation will be slowed. You wanted to see flying cars in 30 years? Whelp now it‚Äôs going to be 60 years. Remember the iPhone that was so cool when it came out ~20 years ago? Whelp that would have been massively delayed, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt have even come out yet today.  Now that stocks are returning less, people‚Äôs 401ks will be impacted, people will invest more conservatively, people will lose jobs as companies make less money, fear will go up‚Ä¶ etc etc. The impact something like this would have is really quite endless.¬†  Ultimately these ideas sound so awesome at first but just aren‚Äôt so simple.

The difference between assets and liabilities is called equity. Capital is basically a risk-adjusted equity.   This may help.

So they need to cut rates to increase economic activity but can‚Äôt cut as much as they needed to because of inflationary impact. They referred to uncertainty on policies as well meaning they expect trump to fuck shit up with his tarrifs.   Money printer is jammed essentially.,Why are they cutting at all?,There goes this month's gains,"The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by a quarter percentage point Wednesday and scaled back the number of cuts it expects to make next year.  In a split vote, the central bank voted to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a new range of 4.25%-4.5%, initiating its third consecutive rate cut of 2024 despite signs that inflation isn‚Äôt entirely going away.  Newly appointed Cleveland Fed president Beth Hammack objected, preferring not to cut rates. Her dissent marked the second dissent against a policy decision since September.  The consensus among Fed officials is for three rate cuts next year, down from four previously forecast in September.",Reality finally sets in  Reducing the labor force and raising tarrifs is going to increase prices  A lot.,Unfortunately the markets have nothing to do with the fundamentals of the economy. They have been disconnected for a long while now. You need economic activity for a healthy economy. Rate cuts are a way to achieve that. Whether you agree or not doesn‚Äôt matter.,Monetary policy (Federal Reserve) can only go so far without the fiscal policy (Congress / Senate) to back it up,TLDR to the people who voted en-masse for the incoming administration in hopes that things will be better in 2025 than they were in 2024: Spoiler alert. Expect the same or worse for the next 2 years.,The market is bubbling up. We don‚Äôt need cuts,"Dual mandate means they have to tackle inflation AND the job market. Lots of people like to bring up the dual mandate to yell for more action on inflation, but you can't forget the job market.  There is a legitimate concern that the job market is weakening, even while inflation is a little higher than it should be, and that lowering rates might help keep people employed.  Stagnation is a word being thrown around right now, which is the worse of all worlds. If the Fed tries too hard to fight inflation while the job market is primed for a recesssion and we start going recessionary next quarter, and inflation still occurs anyways due to tariffs and supply side issues due to the idiocracy of the new administration, then we will have stagflation which is really hard to fix without a lot of pain."

Reducing or removing these tests allow banks to make even riskier decisions with YOUR MONEY and in then end when it fails FDIC insurance (tax payer money) is used to make the bank whole again.

finance,Dec,1h6rj89,Powell says he‚Äôs not worried about the Fed losing its independence under Trump,,"‚ÄúThe question of Fed independence has come up over the past several months, amid reports that Trump may try to pull strings on monetary policy both by legislation and possibly by installing a ‚Äúshadow chair‚Äù who could undermine Powell‚Äôs authority.  However, Powell said there are safeguards in the congressional legislation that created the Fed that will help preserve it from political influences.  ‚ÄúWhat does independent mean? It means we can make our decisions without them being reversed,‚Äù he told CNBC‚Äôs Andrew Ross Sorkin during an on-stage interview at the New York Times‚Äô DealBook Summit.  ‚ÄúThat gives us the ability to make these decisions for the benefit of all Americans at all times, not for any particular political party or political outcome,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre supposed to achieve maximum employment and price stability for the benefit of all Americans and keep it out of the politics completely.‚Äù‚Äù","If he says he's worried, that somehow implies it's within the realm of authority of the president, or that theres a reason to worry.

But obviously that's impractical, congress could never pass those kind of specific laws even if they were expert enough to write them. Instead it transfers all power to the judicial branch since they will now selectively allow the executive to act (obviously while epa will be curtailed this DOGE ""unelected people"" will be allowed to do things congress never specified). This will be allowed because obviously judges have decided they are expert in all fields.¬†   Powell might be surprised to find out what happens when he does something Samuel Alito and Ginny Thomas don't like because they read a tweet that made them monetary policy experts.",Powell likely isn't worried about interference under his tenure.   When Powell's term is up and Trump can appoint a successor he can control - I'm sure everyone else in the dept is worried.,"Were there actually? I thought that there weren't any legal barriers, and that's why Trump was able to run and win.",The dual mandate of employment and inflation is not partisan.  Powell is a Republican.  Not that it matters. Trump is playing with fire,The central bank is not any other agency though. Its more quasi-governmental in that its both a private and public institution done so because of fear that someone like trump would eventually try to control them.

Only difference is that adderall has a sweet drip, and coke is bitter.",A man of substance(s) I see,"Most of the time the crazy weeks are referencing investment banking, where when you are actively working on a live deal, hand holding big companies through an acquisition - part of justifying your enormous fees is providing availability at all hours, meeting deadlines for revisions, etc.   Also there's a fair bit of busy work when not on a live deal, working up pitch decks to propose deals, and always jumping when your MD drops more work on your desk when they leave for the day asking for it to be done next morning when they arrive.   From the client side, having only a few bankers consistently involved is easy - you build rapport and also don't need to re-explain circumstances or preferences every meeting. From the banking side, analysts (at the bottom of the totem pole) want to accumulate work experience and skills quickly so they can move up to bigger and better things - 2 years as a bulge bracket analyst might see you accumulate &gt;8000 work hours, and would you rather jump to private equity now or after 4 years in the trenches?

Dollar is worth less so it takes more of them to buy things resulting in record business revenues - what shock &amp; hard hitting journalism.,The real solutions is increasing taxes and stopping corporate buyback of stocks.

You can see the clear failure in pricing that occurs post Reagan era.,"I believe that when more people started working from home and had more disposable income by not commuting and working at an office that corporations decided the middle class had more disposable income and thus raised prices. After a few companies did it under the guise of supply chain issues that a few might have had, everyone did it.

The time of our greatest wealth equality also saw insanely high tax rates in comparison to now. It turns out the one thing people and businesses hate is paying taxes. So if too high of profit just ends up giving money to the government, business would rather reinvest in themselves, their workers, or lower prices for competition. This gives them actual edge vs the profit bloat we see right now that basically has no consequence. Hell if they are found to be cheating their workers or any number of regulations, the fines are now nothing compared to their profits. They just no longer care.

finance,Dec,1ho8zdg,Can you please explain why this is happening? ,,The fed thinks the economy is doing ok and are saying here is a bench rate reduction.   The market is saying we do not believe you based on the statements of inflation actions coming soon like tarrifs.  So they went the other way.,"It might be the first time in history that we have exactly +100 for -100, but it's not the first time in history that the fed funds rate and treasuries move in opposite directions. This is actually very common. The two do not have a direct correlation.",The market reacted like this because the fed said there would be less rate cuts in the future than what they expected.,"This. Markets are not, as much as people want to believe, rational. They act on imperfect knowledge and belief.","This is the correct answer, so many people misunderstanding this. The 10 year rate can rise even if markets expect rates to fall, they just think they‚Äôll fall more slowly than previously predicted",Market pricing in future near inflation increases,I‚Äôm assuming the Fed is putting more weight on recent actual data whereas the markets are more speculative but in doing so pulling in some political policy change expectations that the Fed would inherently not consider. Once the proposed tariffs have actually been enacted would the Fed consider them immediately or do there need to be signs in the data to reflect the impact of tariffs before they would be weighed in?,"Note that this is a dual axis chart, so it's not that short term and long term rates converged and diverged; rather that short and long term rates are now actually converged. Coming into 2024, the yield curve was still inverted (see in the chart that short term rates were 5.5%, while long term were 3.75% to start the year). Also, recall that people were expecting more rate cuts in 2024 than what actually occurred.  So, collectively, the recent moves are a twisting of the the yield curve so that it un-inverted. The market is now expecting the long term nominal short term rate to be higher than it was before (i.e. the long-run natural rate, or r-star, is now expected to be higher) due to higher inflation expectations, but also due to higher growth/productivity expectations (particularly the latter since productivity growth has been above trend since Covid).   Since the natural short term rate is higher (maybe around 3.5% now), since we expect a term premium to be built into longer term rates, that would naturally tug long term treasury rates (e.g. the 10Y as shown here) higher as longer term rates should be equal to short term + term premium.   Thus, even though the Fed has been cutting short term rates, since r-star has been increasing, the long term rates have been rising to account for expected long-run term premium on top of the long-run neutral rate.",Seems kinda misleading to not mention that prior rate cuts only saw a 10-20bp increase in 10 year yields while this time it‚Äôs literally 100bp.,"It‚Äôs a bummer for those of us who want to buy a house. Savings interest rates lower and yet the mortgage interest rates higher. Housing prices in my area still also going up yoy. We make more money than we did 3 years ago but it still feels just as hard as it did. We have more savings now, but it‚Äôs still tough even if we put down 50k+. 500k houses are 3.5-4k a month before utilities with that down payment. I feel like 400k house is more realistic for us, but they just aren‚Äôt nice and are like 1200 sq ft which is tough accept when you want to have kids.

Every January, four of the 12 seats on that committee change hands due to a power-sharing agreement the Fed in Washington has with the 12 quasi-public regional Fed banks based around the country.  In 2025, those four spots will go to regional Fed presidents in Chicago, Boston, St. Louis, and Kansas City ‚Äî Austan Goolsbee, Susan Collins, Alberto Musalem, and Jeff Schmid.

Gross domestic product shrank 0.1% month-on-month in October, as it did in September, the Office for National Statistics said. It was the first consecutive drop in monthly GDP since March and April 2020, when Britain enforced its first coronavirus lockdown.  The services sector flatlined, while output in the manufacturing and construction industries declined in October. The new data adds to a run of worse-than-expected figures for Britain's economy, with business surveys and retail sales readings also falling flat.  'While the figures this month are disappointing, we have put in place policies to deliver long-term economic growth,' finance minister Rachel Reeves said. Her budget statement on Oct. 30 imposed large tax rises on businesses. Its direct impact will be felt in GDP data from November onwards.  An ONS statistician said there was 'mixed' anecdotal evidence for the budget impact, with some firms saying turnover had been affected by customers waiting for Reeves' announcement. Others brought forward activity.  Sterling fell by around a quarter of a cent against the US dollar. Investors continued to price in around 3 quarter-point cuts in Bank of England interest rates by the end of next year.","There has been weakness across the board in Britain's economy since the pandemic.

Let's make an example.  You own a house and are looking to sell it. You bought it for $500k, of which $400k was in a mortgage. Over the course of your ownership, you've maintained portions of the house, done light improvements, and the market in your area has been good. You've simultaneously been making your mortgage payments.  A buyer approaches you and offers you $750k, which you accept. At the time of this acceptance, you owe $300k on the mortgage. The math follows:  Buying Price - Outstanding Debt = Total Cash to Seller  $750k - $300k = $450k in cash to you. Essentially, the $750k is split up between everyone who provided capital for your original purchase of the house. The mortgage has a set balance paid down over time: this paydown is accelerated through the sale of the house. The remaining amount (your home's equity) is paid out to you.

finance,Dec,1hihkck,The etymology of SRTs,,"This is a structure that checks off the Basel III box but doesn‚Äôt materially remove the risk from the system.  Hedge funds and credit funds are doing most of the buying here, and the trouble is they aren‚Äôt subject to the same capital requirements as banks. That‚Äôs a glaring oversight. They typically run levered portfolios, so if the referenced loans tank and they can‚Äôt cover their obligations, guess who‚Äôs on the hook? The originating banks.  Meanwhile, the banks have already claimed capital relief because they treated the exposure as ‚Äútransferred,‚Äù so they‚Äôre underreserved if things go south. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs still the same risk, just parked with lightly regulated counterparties until the music stops. It‚Äôs got that pre-2008 ring to it, where risk was shuffled around and no one really kept enough skin in the game.","On the investor side, this is basically like insurance. They get paid a premium for assuming the risk. If those loans default, they have to cover losses and pay out.  They don‚Äôt have that much recourse, since the whole point of these things are to offload risk of the books without offloading the actual assets.   The investor benefit is high yields, but you are basically fucked if your risk assessment is off base.","Banks use to offload credit risk on a portfolio of loans without actually selling the loans. The loans stay on the bank‚Äôs books, but the risk gets shifted. The bank pays a hedge fund or credit fund (the protection seller) a premium, and in return, the fund agrees to cover potential losses on that portfolio.  Here‚Äôs the big appeal: by transferring enough of the risk, the bank can go to regulators and say, ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôre not holding all the risk on this portfolio anymore.‚Äù That lets them reduce their capital requirements and free up cash to deploy elsewhere‚Äîlike issuing more loans or chasing higher-yield investments.  Hedge funds, credit funds, and alternative investment managers are the usual buyers. These players don‚Äôt operate under the same strict regulatory capital rules as banks (thanks, Basel III), so they don‚Äôt need to hold big capital reserves against the exposure. For them, it‚Äôs an attractive deal: they collect premiums and, in theory, only take on losses if the portfolio performs really badly.  Banks don‚Äôt typically hold SRTs themselves‚Äîthat would defeat the point since the whole purpose is to get regulatory capital relief.  The system works fine‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. If the loan portfolio starts underperforming (e.g., widespread defaults during a downturn), the bank expects the protection seller to step in and cover losses. But here‚Äôs the problem: many SRT buyers, like hedge funds, operate with high leverage. In a crisis, their liquidity can dry up fast, and they may default on their obligations.  If that happens, the risk boomerangs back to the bank. Now the bank is holding a portfolio with massive losses but doesn‚Äôt have the capital reserves to cover it because it already offloaded those requirements based on the SRT. Scale this across multiple banks, and you‚Äôve got the makings of systemic contagion.  Basel III was designed to make banks more resilient, but SRTs often operate in a regulatory gray zone. On paper, the risk is ‚Äútransferred,‚Äù but in practice, it‚Äôs still hanging around in the background, especially if the protection seller isn‚Äôt financially strong enough to back the deal in a crisis. It‚Äôs essentially a way for banks to play regulatory arbitrage‚Äîshifting risk while maintaining the illusion of safety.  So, while SRTs let banks optimize capital and stay competitive, they also create hidden vulnerabilities. In a worst-case scenario, they can turn into a ticking time bomb for the financial system.",And what happens when these pools of loans are delinquent‚Ä¶do payments on the notes stop or they just replace the pool? what recourse do the investors have on the notes?,"If these portfolios were truly low-risk, banks wouldn‚Äôt go through the trouble of structuring Synthetic Risk Transfers (SRTs) and paying high premiums to offload them. The main goal is capital relief, reducing risk-weighted assets to free up regulatory capital. At the same time, alternative funds see an opportunity to earn higher yields, often on riskier tranches. Both sides are negotiating to avoid being stuck with a bad deal.  The bigger concern is where these end up. Banks have been marketing SRTs to pension funds and smaller institutions, which may not fully understand the layered risks. These structures are complex, and buyers could face outsized losses if defaults rise, especially in an economic downturn. The banks are effectively outsourcing tail risk, and it‚Äôs unclear if less sophisticated buyers are ready for the fallout (Personally, I don't think they are).","IMO retail is kind of not directly impacted here‚Ä¶ most people don‚Äôt even directly own equities. Even then direct exposure is if they‚Äôre able to directly invest in credit funds.  The way bigger problem is that SRTs are a big loophole in financial regulations and present a neat way to hide ticking time bombs off the books. So on the surface banks would pass stress tests but in reality the insuring parties would default, then originators would suddenly face a cash crunch and be forced to cover losses, which would inevitably force the Fed to intervene and bail them out all while someone else makes out like a bandit.   A lot of these synthetic products are intentionally opaque and difficult to understand so that shit can be repackaged and sold. There are few people on Wall Street that fully understand and comprehend the financial engineering that goes into these products.  Uncorrelated garbage loans are still garbage even if you put them together.",SRT?! Dodge?!!! Best financial decision.  ![gif](giphy|1wRaGtcKtDjyw),"Recent discussions have raised significant concerns about synthetic risk transfers (SRTs), emphasizing their complexity and the potential risks they pose to financial stability amidst heightened regulatory scrutiny. These concerns suggest that while SRTs can help banks manage risk, they may also introduce new vulnerabilities into the financial system.  * [Synthetic risk transfers: A growing opportunity in private debt](https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-us/insights/synthetic-risk-transfers-a-growing-opportunity-in-private-debt) * [Synthetic Risk Transfer Issue Summary](https://bpi.com/synthetic-risk-transfer-issue-summary/) * [The Economics of Synthetic Risk Transfers](https://bpi.com/the-economics-of-synthetic-risk-transfers/)  ^(Hey there, I'm not a human \(sometimes I am :\) \).

finance,Dec,1h6oo1a,Can someone explain loan syndication in commercial finance to me?,"Who does it involve, risks and benefits, etc.? I‚Äôm sorry it is vague I am seeking guidance","Sometimes a bank wants to provide a loan to a borrower, but the amount is very large, or they already have a lot of similar exposure, or the capital reserves would be disadvantageous, or some similar reason, they will syndicate the loan. This means putting together a group of lenders and splitting up the risk of the loan among them.   The lead bank gets to make a loan they otherwise could not, which may help them maintain a valuable customer relationship. The syndicate members get to participate in making a loan that they otherwise would not, and get to manage how much of the total risk they want to assume.   Syndicated loans are usually for large corporate borrowers.","In its simplest form, an originating bank has pre-existing relationships with other banks to co-underwrite loans with each bank taking pieces. From the borrowers point of view the only bank involved is the originating institution. As payments arrive, the payments are split in accordance with the agreement. In some cases, the loan could be serviced by a third party.   This allows banks to control the risk percentage of a loan. Imagine that you wanted a risk profile like a particular loan in the amount of $23 million but the borrower wants $100 million. Either you are over on your risk guidance or you sell off the difference, collect a servicing fee, and have a satisfied client.   In a more complex scenario, the loan could be sold in something packaged for sale in a publicly traded instrument.","Adding on to above comment, the lead bank also usually earns more fees than the other banks.  They get extra fees for ""arranging"" the loan and then they might want/get additional business from the borrower by providing additional services at a cost (e.g., treasury management, hedging, etc.).  The borrower will mostly interface with the lead lender and a lot of the communication between the borrower and the lender group will be managed by the lead lender.  Here is a guide to Syndicated Loans which mostly focuses on the leveraged finance/sub-investment-grade market.  LCD Comps was/is one of the primary news and data providers for the syndicated loan market.   [www.lcdcomps.com/d/pdf/LoanMarketguide.pdf](https://www.lcdcomps.com/d/pdf/LoanMarketguide.pdf)","Some risks of syndicated lending off the top of my head:   -Lead lender/arranger may overpromise and underdeliver on the syndication. E.g., they say they'll arrange a syndicate of lenders for a $500M loan and then they're only able to find $400M of commitments, or they say they can raise the loan at an interest rate of SOFR+300bps but then the deal won't clear w/ other lenders unless they increase the rate to S+350bps, etc.  This is probably discussed in the LCD Comps guide.  Some of these risks can potentially be managed upfront by getting the lead lender to commit to meeting certain terms.  -Amending your credit agreement after the loan is in place can be more challenging if you have to negotiate with a syndicate of multiple lenders (vs. negotiating w/ a single lender).  -Refinancing the loan at maturity with lenders who aren't the lead is possibly more risky if market conditions change or if the lenders' strategies change.  The lead probably has more of a relationship with the borrower and will work harder to make a refinance happen.  A participating lender may just have an internal mandate to reduce commitments and loans they don't lead are an easier place to cut.  Also, some lenders are just flaky and will be there one year and then not the next.",Thank you,Thank you
