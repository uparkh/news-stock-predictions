finance,Jan,192ega0,Biden admin to announce independent contractor rule that could upend gig economy,,"Stuff like this is how the IT contracting industry got wrecked for independents.  The IRS threatened to reclassify them as employees, forcing them to work as W-2s through staffing agencies who took a big cut of their pay.",Fuck the cab cartel. Does no one remember how absolute shit cabs were before Uber?,"I think people are forgetting the idea that ""gig"" work is not only done in conjunction with a major corporation like Uber. There are day-work gigs at painting, construction, junk removal, restaurants, and then there's reselling market which are all jobs often paid under the table to people who are trying to get on their feet. The idea that in any way, for any reason, it would be made more difficult for people to get work like this to survive, is evidence of how detached this government is from the people now.","If it‚Äôs a mutual agreement and the latitude gained as an independent contractor is preferable, why undermine that and argue what they want isn‚Äôt helping them?",Just because something is agreed upon doesn‚Äôt mean that it is a good deal especially if one party is under duress,Cap at 5%. In the medical industry a lot take at minimum 30%. I‚Äôve seen instances where they‚Äôll charge $1400 per day and pay the staff who covers $500 per day.,"They were awful. These so called ""professional"" drivers had the same hiring standards as Uber. Passengers had to put with rude and obnoxious drivers and there was no rating system to get them to improve or booted from the service. And ""fastest routes around the city""?? Bruh, if anything cab drivers took advantage of people to drive the long way and run up the meter. Uber and Lyft were a godsend to forcing the cab industry to somewhat improve",So the plan should also do shit to stop staffing agencies or at the very least cap the amount they can take from direct labor,"Or... Or, and hear me out....   We stop linking basic human needs, like health care, to employment.  Enact some kind of health care that covers everyone, or just expand the existing one and remove the age requirement.    Maybe update tax code to make saving for retirement in tax advantaged accounts (TIRA / RothIRA) outside of an employer program  (401k) have higher annual contribution limits.   Lastly make minimum wage (to include contract / 1099 labor) be $20/hr and is adjusted automatically, annually based on inflation and the consumer price index.",I love my gig job üòø it‚Äôs super flexible and provides me a little extra money at my own pace
finance,Jan,19cc90x,Bill Gates says the wealthy should pay more taxes ‚Äì Do you agree?,,"I'm perfectly fine with a late 1950's tax schedule, inflation adjusted.",I don‚Äôt mind it but usually when they raise taxes it‚Äôs always upper middle class employees who bear the brunt of it. The true rich have ways to ‚Äúavoid‚Äù tax.,Capital accumulation has gotten so extreme that we really need wealth taxes. Income taxes will barely scratch the surface of the economic inequality problem.,Changing the income tax brackets won‚Äôt fix it. The Uber wealthy don‚Äôt pay much taxes as a percentage of income or wealth cause their wealth comes from long term capital appreciation and dividends which are taxed at a much lower rate. They can also borrow against their assets instead of selling to avoid taxes.  Congress really need to address that instead of focusing on the income tax brackets but I don‚Äôt have high hopes regardless of democrats or republicans in control.,This shouldn‚Äôt be a question,"Fix tax loopholes by simplifying the tax law.  I'd rather we reduce public spending by making the government more efficient first and foremost though priority wise, one of those is also scaling back defense spending but that is (unpopularly) also implying we should be scaling back bases in other parts of the world which means those countries in those parts of the world need to step up and spend a larger % of their GDP (looking at you Europe).","I take home about 70% of my paycheck. Then if I want to use that money, I have to pay taxes on those products or services. So the real tax rate is much higher. Example, I make $50. After taxes and other deductibles, I take home $35. Then I want to go get $35 in Gas (in NJ), sign says $3 a gallon. 33 cents of that is gas tax. So the gas really costs $2.67. So I fill up $35 worth but really only get $31 worth of gas. The other $4 is more taxes. So end of the day, I  have spending power of $31 from my $50 earned. Meanwhile, billionaires' personal tax in the United States is estimated to be close to 0.5%.","Every year the wealthy becomes wealthier relative to everyone else so they can clearly afford to. So, yes.","I would say pay more fair share of the tax.   Often times, rich has ways to dodge the tax, and many of them end up are paying $0 tax.","Hypocrisy at it's best. These psychopaths own your government. If they want to pay more taxs, all they have to is have their bought and paid for servants in congress to make the changes in the tax code. Read "" The Prince "" by Machivalli. The world has always been run by psychopaths. It always will be because the average person is kept busy struggling to pay their bills and take care of their families...oh and their taxes."
