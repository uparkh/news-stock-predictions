investing,Jan,18w135n,10 years of actually caring.,"Ten years ago I was 24 and much stupider than I am today.  I spent the majority of my late teens / early 20's partying and blowing through money like I had plenty of it (I didn't).  Ten years ago today I made a promise and decided to start saving money, for retirement and just for personal security in general.  [Here are the results.](https://i.imgur.com/L6TbHLv.png)  Pretty self-explanatory, but the left column is the January 1st balance, right column is December 31st, and middle in the amount contributed throughout the year.  This is a combination of three different accounts; TSP (I'm active duty), VFIFX, and a brokerage account.  The large sums of contributions in 2016 and 2020 was money I had saved up from deployments, every other year was just what I could afford to shovel away while not having to eat PB&amp;J every meal.  I guess that's the entire post; it feels good to have turned my life around and started to care about life years from now, both for myself and my family.  I don't make a TON of money, around 80k a year, so it's possible to build a significant retirement in a relatively short period of time without being a lawyer / doctor / IT professional / etc.  Happy New Year to everyone!",There's nothing a V6 Mustang at 24% APR can't fix.,&gt;active duty  You sure you wouldn't be happier with a nice sports car rather than a healthy retirement account?,"Awesome ! Too often at a young age people confuse ""investing"" with ""gambling. As you demonstrate, it is a building process with goals and safe guards. You have held yourself accountable for you future, BRAVO!",I got one word for you son... thundercougarfalconbird,"EXCELLENT work.  You are sitting around where I was at your age.  Maybe a little better.  I kept it up for 30 years after that and I am retired with a $2.2 million net worth.  There will be bumps on the road, maybe big ones (I'm looking at you 2008), but keep on saving.","As a 25 y/o just getting into investing, this is motivating to see what my next 10 years could look like if I stay diligent and focus on a plan. Congratulations and thank you for the great post!","Almost every major military base in the United States has Dodge, GM, and Ford dealerships damn near walking distance from them for a reason.",Partying and blowing money in your 20s.

investing,Jan,193kjjs,US SEC approves 11 spot bitcoin ETFs,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, including those of Grayscale, Bitwise and Hashdex, according to a statement on Wednesday.  Source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-approves-some-spot-bitcoin-etfs-2024-01-10/",Just as satoshi envisioned,I remember someone on here months ago saying he would eat a sock if the SEC approved a bitcoin spot etf.

investing,Jan,1938sv1,AI is going to change DD and trading.,"In 1998 the SEC authorized electronic exchanges; at that exact moment high frequency/algorithmic trading was born. This completely changed traditional trading forever as everyone here knows.                Everyone here who is doing TA is effectively competing against hedge funds / trading firms (**\*cough Jane Street, renaissance, etc\***) that hired former MiT math Olympiads to deploy quant models to pattern recognize better than any simple bot you'll find on github can.             This is obvious. I'm not making this post to talk about chart analysis, but rather I think we're going to see a similar shift happen that we saw in 1998 and it will happen that impacts the traditional financial markets. I think we're going to start to reach a point in the near future where much of the due diligence process is completely automated by language models. For instance, I came across [this the other day](https://mindy.com). It's an AI founded by the founding team of paypal/youtube that you email and can ask questions about anything and it autonomously researches on the Internet and compiles data. I had it specifically research the financials of stocks that I've manually been keeping up with and I was genuinely shocked at the accuracy and didn't realize how rapidly this was progressing. This is something that's accessible right now, but so were basic algorithmic trading systems in the early days if you had basic programming experience. I don't think this will remain the case in the future and the knowledge gap between your average trader and an institutional trader will be more pronounced than it already is. Trading systems will be able to factor in news sources, look across hundreds of different financials, C suite profiles, etc. and figure out what and what not to invest it and when to pull out. It will know when to ""buy the rumor"" and ""sell the news"". Private equity firms are already doing this in the private markets, it's something Blackstone has actively talked about. It's just a matter of time before it becomes advanced enough to do all of this.             AI is something that will be used by all of us to expedite basic research. If you're doing fundamental analysis, use it to your benefit to do DD. If you're trading, realize that the game is about to get a lot more intense.","Lol this was really funny to read. I work at a bulge bracket on WS and this is literally what our bank is working on implementing with traders right now. To be fair, I already don't think your average part time day trader has a great chance if they're trying to do basic TA. You're competing with people that do this for a living. But yes, you're right it's going to get far more sophisticated but the systems will eventually even themselves out amongst the major players.   Fundamental analysis is where this changes things. I think people will just create models to try and emulate successful investment strategies (eg buffet) at an extremely quick rate.   My take: The little guy was already screwed if he was half assing trading anyways. AI will change fundamental analysis overall and help people rapidly find the best opportunities. You can have an LLM churn through thousands of financial reports in minutes, synthesize the results, and match investment criteria better than a human can.","Yes, agree on the last part. But the point is that these systems will begin to become so complex that someone sitting at home trying to trade based on chart patterns is done for more so than now. I do not think there will be clever tricks to outmaneuver bot trading patterns due to the sheer access of information new systems will have.",That's what a lot of the market is already. Automated trades where algorithms are reacting to movement created by other algorithms.,"You're already 10 years too late. Sophisticated AI models have already been trading on the market for a decade, and already make up a huge portion of the market volume. It's great that your LLM can do some DD for you, but you're competing against autonomous agents who already have that DD of every company in the planet in their data and are able to take millisecond responses against new news.  Anyone who tries to do smart daily trading at this point is a fool. You wouldn't try to go up against AI in an art competition or writing or chess, why challenge it at the stock market? You will lose.","Will their models end up manipulating/influencing the market?  Then ending up with competing models , each having market impact,  fighting each other.","Too many people assume AI = consumer facing LLMs and think that ChatGPT is the starting point.   Bespoke AI/ML models have been around for at least a decade and anyone with a large amount of resources has already been using them for a whilw. Hell, I was working on ML backed suggestion engines using TensorFlow back in 2018 at mid size companies no one has ever heard of and I'm a mediocre developer at best. Quant firms who pay their SWEs $400k out of college are probably doing things with AI that we can't even imagine.  It's like looking at the military. The breakthroughs that the general public is allowed to see is stuff that has been around for 15 years. The true bleeding edge technology is kept secret because keeping it secret gives you an advantage over everyone else.","IMO no, if anything it makes DCA into index funds even better because if you tried stock picking you're now up against AI, MIT grads and full time investors. The people that will get hurt the most from this new flavor of AI will be the armchair part time day traders","A code leak is not the same as ""open sourced""","I think that's not hugely different than today.  Outsmarting the market has always been more of a gamble than actual strategy, that's why I pretty much only do low risk moderate return investing and just sit on it forever.  The little guy never wins in day trading",No one ever has access to the best tech because it's proprietary in nature in this context.

investing,Jan,18wa1ny,Twitter-backer knocks billions off its value after Musk‚Äôs ‚Äògo f--- yourself‚Äô outburst,"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-backer-knocks-billions-off-192028495.html  &gt;An investor in Twitter has written down the value of its stake by $2.85bn (¬£2.2bn) after Elon Musk told boycotting advertisers to ‚Äúgo f‚Äî yourself‚Äù.  Fidelity, which helped Mr Musk buy the company for $44bn (¬£35bn) in 2022, now believes the company is worth 71.5pc less than at the time of purchase.  The US investment giant had already slashed the value of its investment by 65pc at the end of October but deepened the discount in November. It came in the same month that Twitter‚Äôs billionaire owner launched a tirade against advertisers.  Speaking at a New York Times conference, Mr Musk claimed a boycott by advertisers was going to ‚Äúkill‚Äù the company, adding: ‚ÄúIf somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f--- yourself.‚Äù  Apple, IBM and Disney are among the major brands to cut ties with the social media platform, amid concerns about lax moderation under Mr Musk and the billionaire‚Äôs freewheeling personal style.  Fidelity‚Äôs valuation cut, which was first reported by Axios, gives the company a notional value of just $12.5bn and suggests Twitter has lost $2.85bn of worth in the eyes of Fidelity in just four weeks.  The investment group, which contributed more than $300m to Mr Musk‚Äôs takeover, does not disclose how it values privately held companies. Other shareholders may value their stakes differently.  However, Twitter‚Äôs own internal stock plan for staff valued the company at just $19bn in October ‚Äì less than half the sum Mr Musk paid for it.",Did Fidelity consult Earth before revising the value?,"It's honestly shocking to me that any major institutions at all were willing to gamble so much money on this ridiculous project. Like, I didn't expect Elon to fuck things up quite *this* horrendously, but it was still an *obviously* pointless endeavor driven almost entirely by vanity from the start and there was zero reason whatsoever to think this dude would have any idea at all about how to run a social media company.",It wasn't worth $44bn by the time the deal closed,"From my understanding several banks loaned Elon about 15 billion dollars to help raise funds for the buyout of twitter  Why, my understanding they wanted to ""develop"" some relationship with the worlds richest man, even if the deal isn't really profitable it creates a business relationship with the worlds richest man what in theory could lead to other business  Then Elon completely screwed them losing them billions of dollars, the banks haven't been able to sell the debt like they normally would and are left holding the bag.   I am not a big Elon fan but I find him completely screwing the banks kind of funny.","It wasn't worth 44bn at any point, which is why he was dumb to offer to pay that.  Now I'd be surprised if it's worth $10bn. Eventual bankruptcy seems inevitable.","All those institutions investing in Twitter were one of the things that happened in the last few years that really brought home the fact that ultimately, nobody really knows what they're doing. There isn't a meritocracy in a large scale sense, there is just a semi-random selection of people at the top.  Buying an established social media company nearing the limits of its growth, at a time when interest rates were rising and the culture was shifting in general to other forms of social media. It wouldn't really have been a good idea regardless of who was doing it. Combine it with Musk's supposed mission and it made zero sense.",How long do you think it‚Äôll take people to truly understand how little Elon cares about investors,It was a mixture of facilities. Some part being Musk‚Äôs Tesla equity. The banks might be having the last laugh.,"Nailed it. A lot of these tech ""titans"" are guys born on third base who had one really good idea paired with the dumb luck of being in the right place at the right time. They're vaunted as gods and society as a whole for many years was willing to believe these guys should be allowed to decide the future of humanity. What is more frightening is that many of them seem to believe their own hype and are seen as their employers or fans as some kind of messiah. Fortunately a lot of them world is starting to see through them but not nearly fast enough.","The banks are getting their money, most likely. Musk is the one losing it."
investing,Jan,19egy4s,Do you still feel confident investing in Google after the obliteration of the search results?,"Pretty simple question, if you have been using Google the past few years you may have noticed how poor the results have become. Particularly in certain areas of the internet like 'local' where currently if you search for best x in city for 98% of terms you just get fed whatever Yelp, TripAdvisor, or YellowPages list has the best keyword match in their title regardless of how old or relevant the actual content is.  5 to 10 years ago those results were filled with local newspapers, bloggers, tv stations, travel bloggers, and other small niche sites that actually had good boots on the ground info. Today they are just outdated lists that were often inaccurate from the start.   Don't believe me? Google 'best craft stores in city' or 'best art supply stores in city' and replace the word city with any of the 10 through 200 biggest cities in the US.... I'll bet dollars to donuts you find those 3 sites I just mentioned and little else in the top 5.  I know Google has all kinds of things going on with their company, I know the old search is dying (if not already dead) and AI results are coming, but at the end of the day search is Google's brand whether they want to admit it or not and for the last 3 or 4 years they have done nothing but go downhill in this regard.  If they don't care about their main thing and don't mind wasting all of our time with awful results for years.... is that really a company you want to invest in? As both an SEO and a Google user you can guess where I land on this.","I ‚Äômember when results span hundreds of pages and I randomly picked page numbers (always quality gems hidden there).    I only google Reddit threads now. The search is basically ‚Äúbe buried under ads and we might through a Wikipedia in‚Äù. It‚Äôs shit.        But stock wise, we buy Alphabet (YouTube, Fitbit, cloud, advertising, teams, etc).    I‚Äôm at overperform on Alphabet for now.","Not sure why you're getting down voted. This is painfully accurate.   I've noticed that they also keep shutting down new products. The cloud based video game service? Gone. Hangouts? Gone. Reader? Gone.   Their search results have been absolute shit since chatgpt came out. If you have to search anything technical, you'll get the same 101 article rehashed by chatgpt on dozens of different sites. I have started using duckduckgo for programming queries.   Sure, loads of people use kubernetes for devops, and kube came from Google. But it's not really a money maker for them. And most people go for AWS for devops operations over Google Cloud, despite the industry's reliance on kubernetes and how GC supposedly incorporates it better.   Others have figured out a good email client by now.   The phone service plan is great, but hardly anyone knows about it.   IMHO, they're losing their niche. Slowly, but it's slipping. They've spent so long trying to break into new markets that they've forgotten the core of their business and it shows.",No need to google reddit threads anymore.  https://thegigabrain.com/,Google's MO has always been to start up 100 new things at a time and then cancel 98 of them so I don't think shutting stuff down is a sign of problems.  Agree with the rest though,"Have you tried searching with those terms using Bing? All you get in the top results is: a list of every craft store in city, ""Yelp"", ""Yelp"", ""Yelp"", Joanne Fabrics, Michaels, and Yellow Pages. So this is not a google problem.","Google suppresses reddit results, I have to type in ""blah blah blah reddit"".   I still believe in GOOG, even if you change the website they still have the browser. I think they'll keep popping up on cutting edge stuff","Earlier poster said TripAdvisor and Yelp are seen as trusted sources so they rank well. Yes, sort of. The bigger reason is that they spend millions of dollars to optimize the huge amount of localized content they have. They‚Äôre writing content to fit the search queries consumers are performing on Google. Users click, which gives Google a signal about the quality of content, giving them a boost in rankings. There‚Äôs a hell of a lot more that goes into it, but that‚Äôs the gyst on the organic search side.   In the paid side, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre realizing just how entrenched they are to individual business performance. There is still absolutely no substitute to drive direct sales. I‚Äôve overseen search budgets up to $80million a year. I had an unlimited budget as long as I hit my ROI targets. Depending on the industry, each click can range from $0.25 for branded terms to $75+ PER CLICK. Big banks spend hundreds of millions a year in paid search. Theres literally no other marketing channel in which consumers are telling you exactly what they‚Äôre looking for, exactly when they‚Äôre ready to buy. Their account servicing teams are effective in keeping that spend up, too. I was once sent an email accidentally by a google analytics team which outlined for a acct rep just about how much they thought their advertising clients likely had available to increase their search budgets by. They came within $50k of forecasting how much I had in discretionary budget (for a budget in the millions).   I used the dip to buy in at $95 after that horrible AI demo and don‚Äôt plan on selling on any foreseeable timeline.",&gt;¬†I've noticed that they also keep shutting down new products. The cloud based video game service? Gone. Hangouts? Gone. Reader? Gone.  [I just want to mention that this is nothing new for Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/)¬†(Reader in particular was shut down over 10 years ago). In my opinion if Google‚Äôs habit of shutting down products was a bad sign for their stock I would have expected it to manifest long before now.,"Part of the problem is that AI has made it way easier to hijack Search Engine Results (via SEO) on all search engines, not just Google. There's been news articles in the last week or so of experts talking about how this has been a growing problem of late and how Google is losing to the bots and will likely continue to lose to them overtime as AI gets even better.",But your action is to still buy Coke so....

The Bureau of Economic Analysis's advance estimate of fourth quarter US gross domestic product (GDP) showed the economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.3% during the period, faster than consensus forecasts. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimated the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2% during the period.  The reading came in lower than third quarter GDP, which was revised down to 4.9%. For the year, the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% up from 1.9% in 2022.","Not only did we avoid a recession in 2023, we didn‚Äôt come close to one. Shocking, though welcome news","Soft landing might be happening after all? Last year around this time when recession kept being forecasted, I thought the bizarre part of it was that unemployment was still extremely low, spending was up, supply chains had largely stabilized, and indicators like housing prices were still high (mostly from low inventory I know, but still they haven't dropped either).  I work in tech, so a big change in this last year has been that job postings have largely dried up. I went from multiple recruiters trying to get my attention at the beginning of the year to maybe a lame ping from one at the end of the year. And there have been quite a few high profile layoffs along the way. But it does seem like if you really need a job, even in tech, you can still find one. There's just more work to do. Many of us are still making good salaries, I haven't seen a backslide on pay.  Cautiously optimistic, seems like we're still getting through various ripples caused by going through a global pandemic.","Time and time again, nothing gets people upset like good economic news. It truly depends on whether your guy is in the White House",&gt;How long can we keep the Ponzi going doing services for one another and calling it growth?  Weird coming from a fan of crypto.,Yes. All gdp percentages are always inflation adjusted,It sure felt like a recession in some sectors. Around half a million tech workers were laid off and layoffs continue.,"I'm sure you can always find some sector that was in a recession by that definition no matter how good the economy was.  It was just a few years ago for example that every sector was up a lot over the last 5 to 10 years during a strong bull market, all except for the energy sector that is, due to how much oil was struggling.","Yea also working in tech‚Ä¶ I find it funny that I was one of those saying a recession won‚Äôt happen, which largely turned out to be true‚Ä¶ except for the industry I work in, lol.  Sucks because I was really hoping to quit my job and take a few months off, but now I‚Äôm a bit too worried that will result in an extended bout of unemployment.","So crypto's digital ledgers aren't a service designed to replace other payment processing services? You know, those ponzi schemes that contribute to GDP.","Eh, a handful of large investment banks and other financial firms predicted it for 2023. It‚Äôs not too surprising considering we had a (albeit mild) recession recently in Q421 - Q122."

investing,Jan,193x11g,Nvidia reminds me of Cisco during dotcom.,"**Note**: This post is *descriptive* of my personal feeling and is for discussion purposes only. It is neither *predictive* in what will happen next nor is it *prescriptive* in suggesting any course of investment actions. I've only done 3 predictive posts on this sub and this won't be one of them.  With the AI fever in full swing these days I kept hearing people comparing it to the dotcom bubble of the late 90s. The merit of that comparison aside, I do agree that Nvidia, one of the biggest companies in this space, really reminds me of Cisco during the dotcom bubble.  For those who are too young to remember that time:  There was this new thing called ""the Internet"", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of ""internet tech"" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation.   And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was ""selling shovels during a gold rush"" and would take over the whole world.   Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher.  The cherry on the top was that people back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer bably!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they will rule the world!  Now if you replace ""Internet"" with ""AI"", and ""Cisco"" with ""Nvidia"", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace ""IE"" with ChatGPT""), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today.  Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later.",You are missing the part where Cisco doubled and split 9 times in the 9 years prior to 1999.  The Internet wasn't built in 1999.   It was built from about 1992 to 2000 and built rapidly.   (of course continued to grow even through bubble burst just slower)  (Ex Cisco guy here.  Best years of my career),I made a fortune from CSCO. Sold it at the right time and did a fabulous kitchen remodel.,"Forward p/e in nvda is ~30.  It was ~26 last week before the run up.  The stock is not pricing in explosive exponential growth past next year or it would be trading even higher.  It‚Äôs priced for continued short term huge growth and slower but stable growth going forward.  The bear case isn‚Äôt that p/e is out of control but that instead of explosive growth followed by steady slow growth, we will have a peak and then actual negative earnings growth when the competition catches up/if ai spend drops(highly doubt that occurs on an absolute basis).",Financial charts are shown on a split basis though. CSCO was not trading at under a dollar a share in the 90s like you would think if you read the Yahoo Finance chart straight.,I had a Co worker at Cisco that managed to sell his stock and options at the absolutely peak (give or take a nickel)  Built a beautiful house.  I still have that news paper headline  from the day that Cisco peaked as the most valuable company on Earth.,Oh I don't have to look at a chart to remember.

investing,Jan,18wwm8d,Is the median person (US) just... screwed?,[deleted],You are already adjusting for inflation by using 6 or 7% annually...,Yep OP - this is important to take into account. Historic returns for S&amp;P 500 are 10-11% _before_ inflation. It‚Äôs closer to 6-7% after accounting for inflation.,"&gt;I feel extremely fortunate to have gotten a financial education. But SO many people aren't able to put away 500+ for retirement. What sort of future implications does this leave? Is it just a higher reliance on social security? Are we staring down the barrel of a huge problem?  For most middle-class people, a **good**  retirement is Social Security and a paid off house. Lots of poor to lower-middle class people will work until they die.  It's unfortunate but also just the way of things in the US. Not everyone has opportunities to do better in life but literally everyone has the opportunity to squander it all away.","It's mostly about knowing your number. Typically you need to save 20-25% of income to replace your income in retirement with a 3-4% drawdown. Issue with the median is it doesn't factor for COL. The median income in a VHCOL isn't expecting to retire these days. But, in a MCOL I think they are.","You have to keep in mind that people who can't retire just... don't. Every time I go to the nicer grocery store in town, I see a row of 70+ year old's bagging groceries.   Just like FIRE people have to deal with heightened longevity risk, people who work until their 70's need far less money to eventually retire. It's bleak, arguably even dystopian, but the fact that many elderly people are still capable of some level of gainful employment alleviates a lot of pressure on safety nets.   Also, pretty much everyone in the Millenial gen or younger is already skittishly hedging around the real possibility that social security looks nothing like it currently does by the time we get there.",It's much easier to save as you continue to earn more.  80k is nice but you seem to be earning more and more....nice job. Your savings rate is good and will get even better going forward.  Chin up,"OP, you are doing great.  Seriously.  A couple of things to consider:  1.  The 7-8% growth you are targeting accounts for inflation.  So the million you are looking at is 1 million in today's dollars.   2.  You will have social security.  It may be less than today in real terms, but it is not going to go away. 3.  At some point you are likely to buy a house.  Then you will have equity too.  So, you are on a great path and have every reason to be optimistic.","Im not sure I buy this. 50-60 years ago houses were a lot smaller, people didn't have a big TV in every room; hell I think many households only had one car. Stuff is definitely more expensive now but there's been a good bit of lifestyle creep as well. There are still places in the US that are somewhat affordable if you can get and keep a half decent job there.",The middle-class is well on its way to no longer existing. Another way of looking at it is the bar to have a middle-class life has been raised so now you need to make the top 10% income to have the same life your parents or grandparents had making the median income in the 60s or 70s.,"&gt;Most people don't have to time or desire to save. They'd rather have the high end technology, brand name clothes, or car to stand them out.   I know the ""everyone else is just lazy and lacks discipline"" is an attractive argument on the finance subs, because it's a nice pat on the back for us. But I grew up in a family where only my dad worked as a plumber. Not a business owner or foreman. Just a plumber. He was able to get the house where one week's paycheck paid the mortgage.  I have a STEM masters and my wife is a speech pathologist. We have gone on one vacation, for our honeymoon, live extremely frugally and have no vices or gambling problems. With our two incomes, we could not afford the house I grew up in. The mortgage would be over 40% of our income.  I think it's comforting to fall back on the ""if anyone has the discipline or work ethic that I've demonstrated is possible, you'll be just fine"" argument. But if you look at the numbers, it will sober you up a little. We truly are living in a different economy and society."
investing,Jan,198a8pc,Tesla stock grab ultimatum,"I just saw this on CNN and may be the first time I ever heard of something like this. Elon Musk is (practically) demanding he have his voting power **doubled** in the company. This after he sold huge chunks, such as to finance buying Twitter.   &gt;  In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company‚Äôs stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.  &gt; ‚ÄúI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can‚Äôt be overturned,‚Äù Musk wrote in a post on X. ‚ÄúUnless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.‚Äù  So the 2nd block he‚Äôs essentially threatening to spin off and make competition.   But how does a public company address this? If they awarded him some GIGANTIC options, it would massively dilute existing shares. If they made another voting class of shares, x20,000 voting rights, they could just give a small pile of those, but what Board could transfer 12% voting interest in a public company based on some tweets? How would that be upholding their corporate responsibilities?  Is this some insider key to the sell off they‚Äôve been experiencing? Cuz it‚Äôs frankly scary to me. And it‚Äôs scary because I think he might get it. Which does a lot to undercut the trust I have in the Board. I had been thinking of doing an option on them if they dropped to maybe 200-205. But this is just an ugly ultimatum that seems capable of vastly changing the value of the company.   OR am I blowing things out of proportion? I admit I don‚Äôt follow the company religiously and for all I know musk makes a post like this every month.   What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs take?","If he wants more shares, he can purchase them like everyone else. He just sold his. He doesn't get them back for free.

There has been a lot of buzz around the BTC ETF lately and prediction-market-made odds are slightly lower than ETF analyst odds for approval.,Letting the market decide seems like the superior polling system to me,Bloomberg's been at like 90% for a while.

investing,Jan,19ag6wg,SEC on Bitcoin ETPs: Analysis of 157 crypto exchanges found that 51% of the reported daily bitcoin trading volume was likely bogus. Sponsor of bitcoin ETP admitted that ~95% of data used in bitcoin markets is fake and/or non-economic.,"Over the recent weeks, the approval of a Bitcoin ETP by the SEC has been interpreted by many as a sign of institutional endorsement of Bitcoin itself as a serious investment.  I find it important to highlight [this longer statement by SEC Commissioner Crenshaw](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023), which she gave after the ETP's approval. It highlights many reasons that argue against Bitcoin. The following is one of the most damning:  &gt;Spot bitcoin markets are subject to fraud and manipulation. One form of manipulation that appears to be pervasive in the crypto markets (and specifically bitcoin markets), is wash trading, a practice whereby traders seek to increase the appearance of high trading interest by both selling and buying the same products at the same time, often driving up prices, and then selling to unwitting third party market participants at inflated values.    &gt;   &gt;Wash trading distorts price and volume, causes volatility, reduces investor confidence and participation in financial markets, and of course, results in investor harm.   &gt;   &gt;One analysis of 29 major crypto exchanges found that wash trading was, on average, **as high as 77.5%** of the total trading volume on unregulated exchanges. The same researchers estimated that wash trading was present in over $4.5 trillion of crypto spot market trading and $1.5 trillion in crypto derivatives trading in the first quarter of 2020 alone.  And further:  &gt;Specifically with regard to bitcoin, an analysis of 157 crypto exchanges found that 51% of the reported daily bitcoin trading volume was likely bogus.    &gt;   &gt;In fact, though reporting regarding bitcoin frequently discusses the enormous size of the market, **one market participant who now seeks to sponsor a spot bitcoin ETP has admitted that ‚Äúapproximately 95%‚Äù of the data used by many participants are ‚Äúfake and/or non-economic**.‚Äù   &gt;   &gt;Indeed, in one salient example, according to testimony by one of his co-conspirators, the former CEO of FTX may have engaged in bitcoin price manipulation in an effort to keep its price under $20,000, presumably to the benefit of his company and himself. In short, prices and demand for bitcoin may not actually be what they appear to be.  The statement by one sponsor is particularly damning. It highlights that these companies are primarily, if not solely, interested in the fees, not in the quality of the products. This is not surprising, yet it seems to be ignored in discussions about institutional stances on Bitcoin, such as Vanguard's decision not to offer these ETPs.  I find it ludicrous to suggest that these products should be part of serious long-term portfolios, such as those for retirement.",Who would have thought.,"&gt;The statement by one sponsor is particularly damning. It highlights that these companies are primarily, if not solely, interested in the fees, not in the quality of the products.   What did people expect? They are *trading* platforms. Not producer/consumer platforms. They couldn't care less whether consumers or producers benefit - only the trading volume is of interest to them. And if there are methods of artificially increasing the trading volume then those will be pushed to the max.","I would bet - though I'm certainly not sure - that the exchanges that have been around the longest while being compliant and not getting hacked (CB, Gemini, Bitsamp, Kraken) probably have the least amount of this.  Do any of these studies break out this data?  IMO, It's not really fair to compare CB or Bitstam's decade long existence, no hacks, following regulations, versus a no-name Russian ""exchange"" that only existed for a year before absconding with customer funds.","For the love of god, it's not a pyramid scheme. There is no mechanism for more profits going to earlier investors or funneling to a few people at the top (as was the case for Bitconnect, btw). It's simply a speculative asset.",Reading the underlying Forbes article the activity being referred to here is bot trading.  Thousands and thousands of trading bots are performing constant transactions trying to profit off every slight rise and dip of the market.  The argument is that this artificially produces trading volume and is market manipulation.,"There's trading and there's fraud, seems like those are synonymous in crypto ""markets"".",I read the entire report the other day and it was enough for me to stay away. I'll stick with equities with an underlying business thank you very much.,"In 40 years Bitcoin may be worth nothing because it has no inherent value nor does it have a use case.   Comparing it to USD is stupid, because USD is a currency, not an investment. And yes, the USD does have inherent value. Buy law, all debts in the US can be settled with USD and it is the only way to pay your taxes.","Not to defend crypto in anyway but you do know that algos also make the majority of trading for stocks etc. right? Washtrading and fake volumes are one thing, but the fact we have human made algos and computers trying to scalp every cent of profit in every market that we have is not at all specific to crypto, in fact I would argue that with ETFs and new products that will follow, we will see more ""legit"" WS firms engage in crypto trading","Some exchanges encouraged or even created wash trading themselves to artificially inflate their volumes and move up the lists of exchanges.  That part is fraud.  Also, wash trading itself is actually illegal."

investing,Jan,18zisiq,I bonds withdrawal gone wrong,"Like many others I utilized I bonds back in 2022 to protect some cash I was saving for a down payment. This week was my turn to cash them in with a plan to convert them into a 12 month CD before using the money in 2025 for what it has been earmarked.  I withdrew all 10820 dollars and three days later only about 7000 showed up in my bank account. No notice, no explanation. 10k left and only 7k arrived. I was confused and annoyed. So I started digging - the first clue was the transaction was initiated by the treasury offset program - an entity that I was unaware of until two days ago, and where state and federal debt gets reported, and which has the power to service those debts with funds that you have with the government (such as I bonds, apparently).   So I called them and they informed me that I had debt in a state that I have not lived in for nearly a decade. I followed the trail with my next call being to that state‚Äôs treasury, which referred me to the motor vehicle department where this debt had been initially reported. It turns out that the DMV in this state has falsely assessed that from 2016-2017 I did not have insurance on a car that I have long since sold. The car was not even being driven in that state in 2016 anymore, but that didn‚Äôt keep them from slapping me with a $3k fine, 7 years later, and collect said fine from my iBond transfer.  I couldn‚Äôt remember which insurance company I used for this car back then, so I‚Äôve been on endless hold/phone loops with all previous insurance companies who have to go digging in their archives for my old policies.   Ultimately, I think I can get my money back, but I will certainly loose out on some interest, and a whole lot of time.   I don‚Äôt know if there is a lesson here for others - the State DMV told me that they tried to reach me but can‚Äôt provide proof of that. I got no answer to why this debt was assessed now and didn‚Äôt come up when I filed for taxes the last 7 years (which they can do, too, apparently). I‚Äôve never had a worse customer service experience than with the US government.  I guess make sure you don‚Äôt have state or federal debts that might get your iBonds garnished when you try to withdraw them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£  TL:DR - my I bond withdrawal was sabotaged by the US Treasury Offset Program.",[deleted],Wow this is scary.

If the light only came on after landing, as indicated by news outlets, then it could easily be attributed to impact-related ‚Äúgremlins‚Äù like a loose wire, connector, or sensor.

investing,Jan,19707cw,What would you change if your job guaranteed a 150k Pension @ 55?,"So I'm in a tax free country that has a retirement age of 55.

Salary is around 210k (tax free).  I've been basically investing in market/tech ETFs for the past 4 years (30 now, started at 26).  My question is, people that do broad market investing do it for the sake of reaching a point where they have a nice nest egg for retirement.  In my case, that is already covered by the pension.

It makes sense that the market would rise with potentially hundreds of millions of people buying positions in their 401k on essentially at the same time on the 15th and 31st.  If so, perhaps I should time my contributions to be 1-2 days later if the S&amp;P has been falling.

The remainder would be semi-monthly and monthly.  So most Americans' paydays are not synching up with the 15th and 31st.  A lot of SS and pension payments may be happening at the end of the month.

You have a lot of time to fill, in a country that is designed to have you chasing the Jones.     Are you going to retire early? At 60?  65?  70?

But playing along, $90k  3. Subtract your yearly VA from that number -- That takes you back down to like $59k  4. Multiply the result by 25.  That's what you'd want, in today-dollars, to have liquid (ie. not counting the money tied up in your paid-off home), to have 4% drawdown each year and likely have gains offset the amount you take out.  So, 1.5M  5.

The Mexican replied, ‚Äúonly a little while.‚Äù  The American then asked why didn‚Äôt he stay out longer and catch more fish?  The Mexican said he had enough to support his family‚Äôs immediate needs.  The American then asked, ‚Äúbut what do you do with the rest of your time?‚Äù  The Mexican fisherman said, ‚ÄúI sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, and stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.

With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, and eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middle-man, you could sell directly to the processor, eventually opening up your own cannery. You could control the product, processing, and distribution,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOf course, you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles, and eventually to New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.‚Äù  The Mexican fisherman asked, ‚ÄúBut, how long will this all take?‚Äù  To which the American replied, ‚ÄúOh, 15 to 20 years or so.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut what then?‚Äù asked the Mexican.

investing,Jan,190rtna,I have $700/month rent profit. Pay down the principal or invest?,I rent a townhouse out for $1950/month. HOA plus mortgage costs me $1250/month. 28 years left on the mortgage at 3.1% interest rate.   I was planning to just send the extra money on to pay the principal. But I know many people recommend investing the money instead.    I am scared to get in a situation where the investments lose money though. Paying it off early feels safer and more secure.   Is there a safe investment that would still be financially smarter than paying the mortgage off early? What would you do?,This is an investment property or your home?,At 3.1% interest I would be trying to pay that principal as slowly as possible. That‚Äôs an excellent rate to borrow money at. Pretty much any safe investment right now will return more than that.,That's what they said,"Or just put it in a 5% HYSA. OP sounds risk averse, and savings accounts are as liquid as it gets in the event money is needed for repairs.",When in doubt I like to go half and half.  Use half on the mortgage and half invested.  Just make sure you‚Äôve got an emergency fund for the rental house first,Don‚Äôt forget you owe tax on that $700 a month. That‚Äôs income in the eyes of the government.,"Yes, I see that. I was replying to someone asking specifically if it was investment property and they edited or deleted their post.","You‚Äôll definitely want to park that money somewhere safe for potential vacancy or maintenance, at least $500 of that.","If you're new to reddit, I recommend not paying it too much attention. It's nice if it goes up, but, well.","Landlord here. You want anywhere between 3mo to a year cash reserves. This should be totally liquid and available within like 48 hours for emergency purposes including potential legal issues. How much to put in reserves is market dependant. I generally go off my vacancy rate which is around 18%. For me, this means I need 6 months.  After that, reinvest your profit. You said your mortgage is something like 3%. How up are you on the maintenance of the home? Roof every 15-20 years. Ac every 15 or so. Water heater every 10. Keep track of all this and plan accordingly. Also you may want to do upgrades every now and then to keep the place nice for tenants. New flooring, tile, etc. Sometimes reinvesting in the home itself can yield a few percentage points return on the new rent you can charge.  After that, you should put the rest in an account that earns more than your mortgage interest rate. This could be a hysa or it could be something a little more risky like a mutual fund account. Up to you depending on your tolerance level. I treat my rental investments as something I want to stay stable during stock market swings so I keep those funds in an hysa. That said I also do income distributions from my rentals so my situation is different than yours.  Good luck! Hope this helps."

This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market.

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.","&gt; After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.

He illustrated that their clients are invested in their ETF, **$HF** \- an ETF he runs through their practice, DGA Advisors.     In his words:  &gt;   *I'm a global macro-manager.*   *One of the ways we reduce unsystematic risk in our absolute return portfolios ($HF) is to utilize macro diversification. This starting point aligns with your initial thoughts on positioning to reduce market timing and individual security selection.*   *As an active manager, I* ***manage a model-driven systematic hedging overlay to the core global macro portfolio that doesn't approach active management from a perspective of market timing but from a framework of gradient risk exposure.***  Notice the buzz words **""Model Driven Systematic Hedging Overlay"" and "" Macro Diversification""**     Anyway - since the fellow linked his name and his practice I couldn't help myself but to check out $HF, this so called Model Driven Systematic Hedging Overlay Strategy.     Quick summary of $HF - this is a ""long-short"" portfolio.:     It has 8 holdings, ALL INDEX Funds. They are VTI + VT + SPYV +SPYG + SPY + SH +QQQ +DIA.   Roughly 30% is allocated towards $SH which is ProShares Ultrashort S&amp;P.   The remainder is long equities, but across major index funds VTI, VT, SPYV, SPYG, SPY, QQQ, DIA.   **Oh - and the expense ratio is 1.53%.**     This ETF is basically a closet index fund with unusual overlap (SPY + SPVV+SPYG??) with a 30% short position.

investing,Jan,19dcbmr,"Following Warren Buffet's 90/10 investment advice, even at an older age?","Apparently Warren Buffet recommends to the average person to invest 90% S&amp;P index fund, 10% bonds. What about those who are starting retirement investing much later in life, such as in middle age? In your opinion would that ratio make sense for older beginning investors also? If not, what would you suggest and why?","&gt;Apparently Warren Buffet recommends to the average person to invest 90% S&amp;P index fund, 10% bonds.   That's what he recommends for his wife.   I don't think he has an asset allocation for less wealthy people, or in general.   10% in bonds for Mrs. Buffet may mean she can live off of the bonds for 20 years.","The issue I would have with that portfolio is that I think it was supposed to be for his wife when he passes, which may not be applicable for most people as we aren‚Äôt billionaires like he is.","If you have a billion dollars that would be good for you too. Having $100,000,000 in bonds would be enough cushion for most people.",I could get by I think‚Ä¶,"I ran simulations of every 30 year period that data existed where the split between S&amp;P 500 index and bonds from 50-50 to 100% stock and everything in between in 5% increments.  I also did different runs with different re-balancing schemes.  Quarterly, annually and based on a threshold of needing to get 1% out of balance.    What I learned is that the 90-10 split Buffet suggested only had marginal loss of opportunity and had the largest reduction of risk in proportion to the loss of potential gains.  It's kind of a sweet spot.  I'm sure he had his people do the same thing and it's how he settled on that split.    Rebalancing quarterly worked out noticeably better than annually but about the same as threshold.  So all my various accounts are 90-10 split and I only looked the balances 4 times a year when the calendar tells me to rebalance.  Been doing this for 13 years now.",Bonds are for wealth preservation. if you have no wealth to preserve may as well go even deeper into S&amp;P,"It depends, I know people who are like 80 in 100% equities and are doing great.","Historically it was to go more and more conservative as you age, but there are lines of thought that the most conservative you should get is the day you retire, and then your risk tolerance should go up over time, as your lifetime requirements go down and you've figured out you're going to die without hitting zero.","The issue with 100% equities is risk not returns, if they experience another recession, they may not have enough time for their equities to recover.  Bonds are like earthquake insurance, if there's no earthquake, everybody without insurance claims to be a genius. Younger people have time to rebuild their wealth (and build more) by investing more in the downturn.  For older people that are on the edge of having just enough to retire, a 40% drop in equities could be catastrophic.  If you have enough money that a 40% drop won't significantly affect your retirement, that's sufficient insurance.",Yeah. The difference in potential earnings between 100/0 95/5 and 90/10 was fairly small but the risk reduction of 90/10 vs 100/0 was large.
investing,Jan,190f2yq,2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions,"I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes.  # Themes  **üí°Inflation and interest rates will fall**  The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates.  Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter.  It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year.  **üí°CapEx returns**  Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending.  With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back.  More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices.  **üí°US election year**  Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election.  Less policy volatility is good for markets.  Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though.  **üí°First half angst, second half gains**  Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don‚Äôt see a recession happening.  BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù fashion.  Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a ""slow then grow"" year. He predicts that the S&amp;P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end.  **üí°Everyone is bullish on AI**  The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC).  In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments:  * Mag 7 (mega cap tech) * Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) * Robotics * Drug discovery * Cybersecurity  **üí°International: Japan, China, and India**  For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe.  The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks.  Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance:  &gt;Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets.  # Risks  **üí°Economic risks**  Interest rates and inflation are top of mind.  The general worry is that we haven‚Äôt felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022‚Äôs large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there‚Äôs a high chance we‚Äôre entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment.  **üí°Geopolitical Risks**  Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks.  My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down.  The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now.  Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before.  # Summary  With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of ‚Äúeconomic normalization to growth‚Äù for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic:  * 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy * 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening * 2024-2025: normalization to growth  We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&amp;P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.","What did they predict for 2023, 2022, etc?  Nobody knows nothing.","If you followed any of these people or firms‚Äô recommendations in the last 5 years, you likely severely underperformed the market.  Ignore short term noise and stay invested.

So it needs to be made clear how it's paid out. If it a dividend as you implied then there is no tax implication but you also can't take that out without a penalty.   If companies could arbitrarily add money into your Roth IRA without running up against contribution limits, then there would be a business around it with companies offering that as a service.   What's stopping SoFi from offering to 100% match your contribution if you pay $X additional as a fee?"
investing,Jan,192id67,Best brokerage 2024 edition,"I know it's been asked before, but I'm looking for an updated version. What's the best brokerage for 2024?  For reference, I've been with ScottTrade, TD Ameritrade, and Schwab - all without ever changing my account. üòÅ I do relatively basic investing: mutual funds, ETFs, and single stocks, and I avoid the more complex things like margins and shorting.  I really liked TD Ameritrade's platform and how I could easily view my portfolio balance in different ways, like what industries I'm in, and % for each. The Schwab platform has just felt flat by comparison.","I like Vangaurd because the interface is so clunky it makes me hardly want to use it, thereby preventing me from being trader instead of an investor.","For me its fidelity , you have access to auto investing partial shares of etfs , which you don't have at schwab you can't even buy partial shares of etfs at schwab.

Their platform is designed around gamification and the feelings you get while pulling the lever at the slot machine. Confetti drops on the trade, easily erase all your past performance charts to give you that fuzzy feeling you're doing good. They over glorify risky investment choices like trading options, individual stocks, and trading on margin. You can almost make the claim that Robinhood more of a betting/gambling platform than an investment platform.",Interactive Brokers,I hate that I lost my historical data when I was moved to Schwab.,Asking about the best brokerage is a horrible concept that I wish people would stop using as a means to decide on which broker to use.   What may be a great broker for one investor or trader may be a horrible choice for another.   Most people simply go by their own subjective viewpoints based on look and feel versus actual functionality and services.   And even from a functionality perspective - it's highly subjective without understanding the services requirements of an investor and/or trader.

Then at 55 I can withdraw that $50k.  It's called a roth conversion ladder if you want to do more research,You can also access money in your 401k penalty free starting the calendar year you turn 55.  Lookup the Rule of 55.,"Yes that's the optimal strategy here.  I plan to retire before 59.5 and I only contribute to my traditional 401k as I believe it's far superior than a roth(another debate).   To access these funds, I'll start converting the traditional balance to roth the first year of retirement. Then I can get those contributions tax free in 5 years.  Between retirement and that 5 year window I'll use standard post tax money in my brokerage account to bridge that gap",You can access 401k money early without penalty if you take SEPP. Look it up.,"Wouldn‚Äôt you want to wait until a year you have no income though? As then the money is taxed at a much lower effective rate (first $40k for example, compared to $40k on an already $140k of income)?",You can withdraw all the gains tax free at 59.5,"The key is if you terminate from an employer in the year your are 55 or older, that specific employer's plan is able to access funds without the 10% early withdrawal fee. If you left company A in the year you are 54 for example the age 55 rule would not be applicable when you turn 55, you would need to wait until 59.5",An IRA isn't a plan. It's an account. Every IRA can do what he is saying.,"You're describing a Roth ladder.  I'll add the caveat that you can withdraw *the amount you rolled over* in 5 years, not the current value of that amount you rolled over.  If you rolled $60k over and it became $120k 5 years later, you can still only withdraw that $60k.    There are also other methods of getting retirement money early, with their own caveats.",I stand corrected.  I researched this a bunch a while back and I really thought that 72t was only IRA.  My bad.  Cheers

This early issuance of a whole year's allowance is a first and provides certainty for smaller private operators to plan their year. The allocation nearly matches the allowances granted for the whole of last year. Chinese refiners have been slow to purchase spot cargoes due to a lack of quotas, leading to a drop in prices. Additional quotas may be issued later in the year with the start-up of the Yulong mega refinery in Shandong.    Summarized by GPT-3.5  This seems strange to me. Is China stockpiling in preparation for a war with the US?","The only right answer: maybe?  There are plenty of articles and videos about why China will or won't invade Taiwan.

However they do understand that in these sorts of power relations, people need to believe you will back up your words with actions. They just want the US to respect their power and not to get taken advantage of.","No, I think it's a pretty clear no.    Amphibious invasions are hard and the biggest problem is that failure means near-total destruction of your forces.  You don't get a chance to retreat and try again like Russia did when attacking Kiev.    Failure militarily on a Taiwan landing would be political and economic suicide for China, and any invasion with current weapons/technology has a very very high chance of failure.    The other issue is that in order to try to have a higher chance of success you must send more forces.  Yet the more forces you send, the more suspicious the buildup will look on satellite imagery weeks in advance.    With all this in mind, it makes absolute perfect sense why China is happy to talk tough and make others think they want to invaide, because they (correctly) realize that an actual invasion is far too risky.","China, as a whole, wants money, yes.

You can hold for up to 30 years without paying tax on gains until you redeem. Which means you can wait until a year when you're in a low bracket to redeem, thereby paying a low tax rate on all those gains over the years.  For me, this is a big deal...

Now, would I recommend somebody dumping their yearly limit into I-Bonds in April to lock in the rate, no because you can't predict the future. If the Fed starts to cut sooner rather later (like in March), then I can certainly see where inflation goes back up which point, I-Bonds rates would go back up, and make them even more attractive at the new rates.

To facilitate this, at retirement we changed from Large Positions in a Small Number of funds -- not exactly a 3-fund portfolio, but close enough -- to Smaller Positions in a Larger Number of funds: **separate** funds for Large-Cap, Mid-Cap, Small-Cap, Long Bonds, Short Bonds, Tech, etc, etc.  Then, quarterly or so, if mid-caps are up more than large-caps (which also overweights that sector), we sell more of them.  Same for other sectors.  You can't sell JUST mid-caps, if all you own is an S&amp;P 500 and Total Market funds, right?  It's not really locking in profits, but it is a form of profit managing.","It depends on the stock. Something like $VTI, I never need to take profits out of. A while back I got into Cloudflare ($Net) in like the $30s. It peaked at like $220. Losing all that I gained would be far worse than the risk to gain more. I kept watched and it as it kept dropping, I kept selling. Sold most at $190 and then the rest at like $180.                   As the stock climbs, I keep changing my floor I want to sell at. You want to keep the floor low enough for the stock to recover and maybe keep climbing but high enough to minimize losses.","I don't lock in profits.  I'm generally buy and hold.  I will sell if my investment thesis for the stock turned out to be wrong or something substantial changes with regards to that company.  If a single stock becomes a huge part of my portfolio, then I will sell enough to switch into VOO.","I don't sell unless the fundamental economics or business of the company has changed. I learned this the hard way when Tesla doubled about a year after IPO and I sold it.    If I had sold just because my stocks have gone up I would have sold off all my positions in AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, FB etc. instead of being up 1000%+","‚ÄúLocking in profits‚Äù is a vanity play at word or at a silly strategy at best.  The decision to sell should be based on 2 factors alone:  1. You need cash now 2. You no longer think it‚Äôs a good investment for XYZ reason (expensive, fundamentals, etc)  The fact that you are up or down is irrelevant","Set your target, say 100 percent. Then remove the cost basis and let the remainder cook.","If you buy quality companies that will continue to compound earnings, a good strategy is to never sell until you run into concentration issues. If a position grows to say 25% of your portfolio maybe it‚Äôs time to think about taking some profits.",I keep buying and never sell.,"Yes, this would not be for any of my VOO, VTI holdings. I'll even put BRKB in that category.   Eventually I would like to consolidate my holdings and grow the VOO/VTI holdings through the process.","Same here.  I shudder to think if I ""locked in"" my profits on AMZN, NFLX, MSFT, NVDA, etc when they doubled or tripled."
investing,Jan,191ou1z,How do you stay motivated when you see others making a lot of money?,"As someone who closely follows the stock market, I feel demotivated when I read about successful startups and businesses whose executives/individuals are pocketing large sums of money. Despite having a good-paying job, I still feel like I could have accomplished more. How do you deal with similar feelings? .",Comparison is the thief of joy.,Compare yourself to where you were yesterday. Not to others. Continually improve yourself and your portfolio while not concerning yourself with others.,I don‚Äôt compare myself with those that more successful because I have no idea what advantages or work they‚Äôve put in. They may have been born into significant wealth/advantages that hard work can never achieve or put in so much time/effort that I‚Äôd never care or want to do.  I‚Äôm more concerned that I‚Äôm doing better than the me of yesterday. If I ever feel demotivated I only have to look at those that are actually struggling to realize how good I have it.,Unless you compare yourself to everyone less fortunate than you,Well you‚Äôll only hear the success stories and not the 1000 failures that came before it. Hopefully that makes you feel better lmao,It helps me to think about the much larger number of people making less than me.,Head over to r/Wallstreetbets to see some eye watering loss porn to help you realize how good you‚Äôve got it.,What are you goals?  To be richer than everyone else?  If so you are almost certainly going to be disappointed unless your name is Elon or Jeff.  There is always someone who will be more successful than you out there in any endeavor and if you let someone being better you will never get anywhere.   If you goal is to create wealth for yourself the best way is to continually keep investing in the market from a young age.  You will end up ahead at the end when it matters.,Work harder and make more?,Just shows how all minds work differently. Because I‚Äôm deffo lower class but I still think I‚Äôm very lucky to be born in a 1st world country.
investing,Jan,1abpy9k,Is it ok to never have bonds if you start investing early?,"Big IF there   I‚Äôve always heard to add bonds once you get older, just curious if it‚Äôs ok not to  Say someone has a balance of $1,000,000 in VT or VOO and they‚Äôre in their 50‚Äôs or 60‚Äôs, then say their balance either goes to either $800,000 or $1,200,000. A big swing, but what is the difference really if they were never even going to spend close to hundreds of thousands at once anyway?   There are other factors like if their house is paid off, kids etc, but just as a basic example do you need bonds really if your balance is what you would consider high?   I‚Äôm 31 and never plan on having bonds. Currently at almost $100k between my Roth IRA that I started maxing 6 years ago, and taxable account.   I won‚Äôt get into what I have since there‚Äôs always a debate about it, but it‚Äôs something we‚Äôll known/safe like VOO, VTI, SPY or VT, it‚Äôs one of those actually lol let me know what you think!","&gt;but it‚Äôs something we‚Äôll known/safe like VOO, VTI, SPY or VT,  In 2008 those funds lost over 50% of their value in a few months. Can you stomach those type of losses?  Imagine being 65 and retired with a good nest egg of 1,200,000 then a few months later having a balance of 580k... will you be able to stomach those kind of losses or will you panic sell ?","There's a real economic risk. Risk is not just panic/psychological.  If you funds lose 50% and you have to sell to afford food, shelter, etc., then you have a smaller base for future growth.  You may never be able to make up the loss.  This is basically the sequence of returns risk.  There's no guarantee the market will quickly rebound.","You view bonds as just a lower yielding asset. You miss that bond and stock returns are not perfectly correlated. There are countless academic papers on the subject, but the short version is that a stock &amp; bond portfolio can provide a *higher yield* than stock only, especially when there is spending on the duration.   For example: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4227132",An emergency fund is supposed to get you through a few months. Your retirement fund is supposed to last you *decades*. These are not the same thing.,"&gt;Me personally, I‚Äôd never sell at a loss   So you're never going to spend your retirement money?","You're missing something here.  Sure, it'll still be at a gain.  But when you are retired the gain isn't as important as the reduction in your portfolio, possibly to a level where it no longer safely sustains you.  Let's say you've got the perfect FI number, just enough for a 4% withdrawal to meet your expenses, with no real fat, after 30 years of investing and everything has an average gain of 70%.  The market drops 25%, along with your nest egg.  You're still up 45%, great!  But now you have 25% less *actual money* \- regardless of gains - so you're potentially in a bit of a pickle, because you have no choice but to sell a *disproportionate number of shares* in order to harvest your required expenses.","Yea I should have mentioned that. In 2008 this was a issue that really wiped people out.  People lost their jobs, they couldn't find new work as no one was hireing outside tech. People were forced to sell their 401ks at the bottom of the market to survive   If you had a healthy allocation to bonds as interest rates dropped those bonds went up. Your losses were not as bad , and you could sell off some of those bonds to survive",T bills are a form of bond,You don‚Äôt need bonds until you retire. They will help you with sequence of returns risk.,"&gt;  he loans to corporations, he gets tons of warrants and a high interest rate to sweeten the deal.¬†  That's basically a bond."
investing,Jan,19bk9go,My experience buying solar panels as an alternative investment,"Located in Portland Oregon, in an energy efficient home I paid about $1100 total in 2021 for electricity.  (Rates have since increased substantially.) I had some extra cash on hand that year and the stock market valuations were insane. Inspired by a 10 year old post from ‚ÄúMr. Money Mustache‚Äù on beating the S&amp;P500 with insulation, I took a look into the cost of buying solar panels as an alternative investment. Your experience can vary a lot depending on your location &amp; home's age etc, but my experience has been positive.   The total cost for my system (excluding 30% tax credit) was $17,800 out of pocket, 50% up front and 50% after activation. It‚Äôs sized at 5.6 kilowatt to offset the majority of my electricity use.  In 2023 the panels saved me \~$883/year of after tax money that would have been spend on electricity. For the net $12,460 I spent to get here that makes for a 7% rate of return.‚ÄÇ  Home solar as an investment is best considered as if it‚Äôs a 25-30 year bond with monthly tax free coupons roughly tied to inflation, and whose face value depreciates over time, but you have to sell your home to collect that! (Obviously best to stay in the home for a long time.)  One thing I found true of every installation company I talked to was that financing rates were usurious even with great credit &amp; a Fed funds rate at 0! Also, leasing = fleecing; there‚Äôs simply no ROI for that path and you end up with a lien on your home which will make it difficult to sell. Solar as an investment only makes sense if you pay in cash.  Full post https://engineerdog.com/2024/01/20/are-home-solar-panels-a-good-investment-7-tips-and-my-review-after-a-full-year-2/",I did the same thing and came out with about 8-9 percent return since in nj they actually pay you for what you produce. Also another benefit is there is no volatility. Also if you average out about 2-4 percent yearly increase in energy costs the return is even higher in later years,"Yeah I did the same! Where I live (Scotland), the government will give you an interest-free loan for solar panels, a home battery and a used EV so I loaded up on all three.   The interest-free loan means there's no opportunity cost - I didn't have to liquidate any investments, and the loan repayments are less than my monthly savings on electricity bills. No money down, and I'm cashflow positive from day 1.    Owning productive assets using zero-interest debt during an inflationary period is a great opportunity. As you point out, it's also a hedge against inflation and energy prices.   I also get paid to balance the grid by discharging my home battery during times of unexpected demand.   When you roll in the total savings of the setup (including gas savings) I'm hitting \~20% ROI which is pretty phenomenal. More if you factor in the inflation hedge.",Your solar panels are illiquid and you can‚Äôt recover your initial investment back until you break even. It‚Äôs not close to being comparable to buying bills or stocks. It‚Äôs far worse.,One way in which is not the same is that the ROI stops at the end of the solar panel's life.¬† The same cash in VOO will continue to compound until you pull it out.,"Not for the purpose of investing, no.","This is true. My equipment is rated for a 25 year life but thats a looong time to hope nothing poops out early. On the bright side I bet replacement cost at that point is substantially less than original install since the permits, mounts, &amp; wiring are already in place.",Solid. Yea your experience can vary a lot by state.,"This.   Day rate is 30p, night rate is 7.5, export is 5. Crucially, any solar I save into the battery and use later saves me 30p,   The solar panels generate free energy, but the battery basically allows you to do time arbitrage with that energy. Only 8% of my usage is coming from the peak rate (even in our Scottish winters), the other 92% is either free or 7.5p.",Yea theres always an opportunity cost and S&amp;P's been ripping this year. No way to know that that would happen this particular year in advance though. I feel like its more fair to compare solar to long duration bonds because the cashflow &amp; risk level of both investments is similar.,Yea. My utility provider doesnt pay you back for excess generation so surprisingly a smaller system that covers slightly less than 100% of your needs is optimal.
investing,Jan,19drbyk,Should I cut my EV losses or just ride it out?,"Went big on EVs some years ago. At this point I‚Äôm just hopeful a few of the smaller guys get bought out by a bigger company.

The big car manufacturers have their own tech and there is no competitive advantage for one of the big ones to buy a start up. Easier to let it die on the vine. LCID fan boys talk about their proprietary tech but the stock price won't get up to where you bought it at, if it even survives.",No shit; it's called having a conversation. You don't have to be part of our conversation.,"Such as life. Fortunately not all my eggs are in one basket, doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to swallow.",I think it only makes sense to sell at a loss if you want to offset profit from another transaction. Otherwise I would probably keep them because you might as well gamble the rest and hope it recovers at some point.,"It‚Äôs more than that. Charging is not feasible for most people. The infrastructure just isn‚Äôt there yet. Most people who wanted an EV got one and now others don‚Äôt want one or are waiting. Or are buying hybrids which I am seeing friends, coworkers, and family all doing recently‚Ä¶",I see a lot of Rivians on the road these days. Far more than I see any other niche EV maker other than Tesla. I've seen a few Lucids but a lot of Rivians.,"Sell them all. Buy sector index instead, if you still want that specific exposure."
investing,Jan,19d110s,Robinhood will pay me 1% to leave. Will TD or Schwab pay me any bonus to stay? Anyone know?,Anybody have any stories of retention bonus? I have about 5 million across the two sites if that makes a difference. Getting $50k to move seems like a pretty good deal if the sites will do nothing to keep me. Any info that would save me time negotiating would be greatly appreciated. thank you!   (does anyone offer more than 1% to mover your money??),I moved out of Robinhood and into Fidelity and I've been very happy with the decision.   1% isn't going to bring me back.,"I had major problems with Robinhood but I feel much better having my long term investments with Fidelity, a brokerage with a long history, physical locations, and you can get a person on the phone should it become necessary.   With Robinhood you may be at the mercy of a chatbot and an email in an emergency, that could get scary pretty quickly.","I would check that $50k bonus. Not saying your math is wrong, but sometimes those bonuses are capped at a dollar amount.  And if they will truly give you the $50k, I would also make sure you see how long you have to leave the money there to receive/retain the bonus.","Mate, you have 5 mil already. I wouldn't be concerning myself about 1% bonus to move to an unproven brokerage.",Two years for 1%.  That‚Äôs pretty negligible,Current 1% promo is uncapped but you need to keep it there for 2 years.,"Fidelity's customer service line is actually amazing. I get to a real person within 5 minutes and they know what they are doing. Plus, they will give you a callback number to that exact rep so you don't have to explain your situation to a new person if you need to follow up.",It‚Äôs not free because then you have to use Robinhood lmao. That‚Äôs the price.,"TD absolutely will pay you to stick around, however, it is 100% dependent on your balance with them.","I doubt you will find many brokers with a 1% bonus.   Most brokers don't have the same issues with attracting large account sizes like Robinhood.   The average account size at Robinhood is only $4k as opposed with larger brokers where the average account size is in the six figures. Presumably, that's why Robinhood has these types of promotions.   The average bonus at most brokers when I recently looked is about $350 per 250k. Some brokers will also negotiate fees for active traders/investors."
investing,Jan,1acdf0s,Should I try to pay off my car note?,"I have a car note of 5.49% for 6 years. Payment is $346.61 monthly. It's my only debt, and while I don't like paying interest, my thought is the money works better in my retirement accounts. Should I try to pay this off quicker at the expense of maybe not maxing out retirement investments? Is there a way to refinance that makes sense? I'm not young, but have never had a car note before so not sure what to do.","Unpopular opinion here:  Min/maxing 1-4% will not make enough difference over 6 years to justify maintaining vehicle debt. Considering that lump sum investing performs better than DCA, you‚Äôre better off paying off the vehicle and putting that $350 into the market.","My two cents. If you have a solid emergency fund and If you think you can make more than the interest rate (after taxes) on a investment. The go for it. I think either option is good, since we cannot predict the future.","You are absolutely right, your money works better in your retirement account, so before anything else, max that out.   There is nothing wrong with a 72 month car loan as long as you don‚Äôt owe more than the vehicle is worth and you aren‚Äôt cutting into your retirement savings with the monthly payment. Yes, the interest rate is higher than some prefer, but if you bought a car you‚Äôve always wanted or got a nicer one than you‚Äôve had before, some of the price you‚Äôre paying is for happiness‚Ä¶.if you like the car, keep making the payments. If you‚Äôre more worried about the monthly payment or paying that interest, sell it and get something you can afford outright.   I doubt you will find a better interest rate in refinancing as the average rate on a 3-year note is right around 6% these days.","There is also a psychological advantage to paying off the car loan.  You don't have to look at the bill every month, see the money go out, stress about having it or paying it on time.  Take that stress off the table and leave yourself open to make more money.","You can‚Äôt predict the future, true, but we do know the interest rate","I totally agree with this. You‚Äôre not going to come out much different either way. I would prioritize clearing the car debt quickly because it‚Äôs a very specific and focused goal, which makes it more likely that you‚Äôll approach it energetically and achieve it. Saving as much as possible for retirement strikes me as more abstract thus easier to make excuses for not pursuing with the same degree of commitment.",It can be -10% too.  You‚Äôll see it someday,That‚Äôs why you make a 20% or higher down payment.,My car loan is 4 years at 2.5% not sure why I'd want to limit to 3 years. Also most new cars will be under water initially because of depreciation,I can afford it; I just don't like having a car note. I'll try to speed up payments without taking anything from retirement accounts.
investing,Jan,18vrlp4,If I'm bullish on the future what's the point in holding VOO? Shouldn't I just get TQQQ and hold long term?,[deleted],"TQQQ resets every day.   If QQQ goes down 10% and then up 10%, it will be at 99% of its original value. TQQQ on the other hand will be 91% of its value.","TQQQ is a 3x leveraged fund.   Leverage isn't free, particularly in a 5% federal funds rate environment.   There is also a volatility drag when held long term due to the way leveraged is applied.   A lesser effect than all of this is the relatively high expense ratio.   It's not just a matter of having a high risk tolerance and time horizon.   If held continuously, you are getting a worse risk adjusted return than VOO (further from efficient frontier) and you have a realistic chance of the fund being near worthless, including if held for decades.     I'm not saying don't ever invest in TQQQ, but understand the risks.   I wouldn't invest anything you wouldn't be okay with losing, such as retirement balance.","Someone on r/ETFs backtested TQQQ to March 10, 1999 to incorporate the dot-com crash hit. It got hit so hard that an initial $100 investment would have dropped to about $0.50 in 2003 and wouldn‚Äôt get back to break even until 2019.   https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/tkqhuy/tqqq_backtest","Based on the downvotes my comment got, it seems like a lot of people really don't understand just how expensive that leverage is right now lol","\&gt;I completely understand the bigger swings etc and have done a bit of research into TQQQ.  &amp;#x200B;  so you understand long term levering your ass up on an index is almost certainly a bad idea?  &amp;#x200B;  TQQQ looks good because it started in 2010 and you can't zoom out further. go look at what 3x leverage on another sector or index looks like long term, that should dissuade you.","Its inception date was 2010, we will see how it handles a 2008 style 2-3 year drawdown.  I expect the pain will be immeasurable for people who act like it cant happen.",You ‚Äúwouldnt touch the sell button‚Äù and ‚Äúhave a 30 time horizon‚Äù but here you are talking about selling VOO for what you think is the next best opportunity. What happens when the next shiny ETF crosses your eyes a year from now? Stop thinking about it and just stay VOO if you believe in it.,"In 2002, QQQ hit -82.98% **unleveraged**. A -80% swing with TQQQ might actually be one of the best outcomes you could imagine.  If QQQ ever hit anywhere near -82.98% unleveraged again, TQQQ is going to be completely worthless, to the point where the fund would likely have to consider liquidation. Funds make money based on expense ratio. Right now, TQQQ runs off a \~0.9% ER. If TQQQ lost 90% of it's value, that ER would need to be \~9.0% ER to make an equivalent amount of money for ProShares - not the sort of ER anyone would want to spend. I would personally be pretty depressed if my assets lost a massive amount of money **and** I got a notification from my brokerage that I'm getting a cash transfer from ProShares for the current NAV of my assets.",Yea stock market is primed for a blow out year after the Nasdaq made a paltry 40%,"Large cap growth stocks underperform in the long run. If you invested money in small cap value 50 years ago, then you would have 4x as much money today than if you did large cap growth. Additionally, unlike with normal funds, leveraged funds introduce the risk of total loss. As in, you permanently lose all your money and holding for longer never brings it back. This is an unacceptable risk for most people and I highly recommend you don‚Äôt do this."

My online bank is giving me a chance to roll over my CD into a 14-month, 5.30% interest CD.  This seems pretty decent compared to brokered CDs that I see with Schwab, T-bills, and more.  I don't think we'll see the government cut interest rates as fast as the market seems to be expecting, but I don't think they'll raise rates further, either.  So this seems reasonable.   Any thoughts/feedback?","Seems reasonable. I opened a 13 month cd last month at 5.5%.

investing,Jan,192kycw,Pay off mortgage or invest money to retirement?,"My wife started a job with a startup that is doing very well. So much so that the shares she was given are now worth around $800k. She will soon have full access to the shares to do as she pleases. With that being said, we are considering three options:  Option 1: Leave the shares in place with the hope that the company continues to do well.  Option 2: Withdraw all, or a portion, and reinvest in more conservative stocks, such as low-cost index funds or something of that sort (we're not very knowledgeable on stock investments, other than the average). We are in our mid/late 30s for refence.   Option 3: Withdraw enough to pay off our mortgage, which would be around $780k at 2.90% on a 30 year fixed rate.  I have done some research and the main takeaway seems to be that because we have such a low interest rate we can go with Option 2 and get a higher return on our investment than paying off the mortgage and say reinvesting the $3500/month that would have been going towards the mortgage.  A bit more background. We already have a 6 months emergency fund and other misc. savings. We also don't have very much as far as debt. We do have a $850/month car payment, of which she receives $750/month towards it, from work. No credit card debt.   Will appreciate any advice or further questions I need to be asking ourselves. Thank you in advance.  P.s. Option 3, paying off our mortgage, seems very tempting to us. Just the idea of knowing we can be mortgage free in our mid 30s sounds very enticing.",&gt; $780k at 2.90%  You can get over 5% in a savings account or money market fund now.  Don't pay off the mortgage at least until those rates fall below 2.9%,I‚Äôm not even going to read past the title. The math with this is extraordinarily simple.   If expected Investment return % &gt;&gt;&gt; mortgage interest % = invest   If expected Investment return % &lt;&lt;&lt; mortgage interest % = pay off mortgage,"With a 2.9% rate, I would not pay off the mortgage if I were in your shoes.

Thanks!","Yes, investing in low-cost index funds will almost always outperform active management over time.","Remember: Your advisor‚Äôs goals are also retirement, home and car. Just not yours.","Listen to everyone telling you low cost ETFs that track the S&amp;P.   There is EXTENSIVE literature that consistently affirms the notion that it is extremely extremely difficult to be the S&amp;P500 over decades and decades. There's a few fundamental reasons why.   1) Any well run business will naturally find it's way to the top of the market cap list. That's definitional. So the biggest companies aren't simply ""the biggest"" or richest. They are the ones over time that have been run well even in ways you can't really specify or articulate. Therefore, your portfolio only contains companies that are good at being companies. And in the future, the most likely companies to be profitable are the ones that have already proven they are good at it.   2) The very very very smart people whose job it is to read the market and value companies are literally geniuses. The smartest people on planet earth are drawn to these jobs because they can make the most money. We aren't smarter than them. So do not try to beat them. Not only are they way smarter than you, they have endless resources, data you can't even imagine, sophisticated computer algos, and all their time and energy to devote to it.   3) It's costs almost nothing. This one is pretty self-explanatory","So I should basically ditch my guy and go all in on fidelity?   I have a Roth and a ‚Äúsingle account‚Äù through Ed jones.

Dumping everything into S&amp;P might give you the best returns over decades, but it's considered a relatively risky investment. Plenty of risk averse people would pull everything out as soon as they hit -10%.  Also some people invest because they'll need the money in X years, and if that X is low it might not be prudent to put everything into stocks.  Now obviously you could learn about risk management without an advisor and do everything yourself (including periodic adjustments), it's not that hard. I just wanted to point out that dumping everything into an index is hardly the best strategy for most people who know nothing about investment.",Get out of Edward jones and just invest in mutual funds or etf yourself,"Put it all in big cheap broad index funds and you will probably outdo 85% of the world.

But early on chunk money into your 401k, max an IRA, invest in low cost diversified investments and watch it grow devoid of major major costs.    then when you have amassed a decent nest egg, you have OPTIONS.  when you go to an advisor with a chunk of money, you have negotiating power.   when you go with a $500 check you pay what they tell you to pay.

I also want performance in line with VOO. Note the flip side of performance is risk.   Where an advisor makes sense, is things like holding individual stocks mirroring the S&amp;P500 to make better tax loss harvesting. To advise me on when to set up a 529 or UTMA for my kids. To connect me with a good life insurance broker. To advise me on tax advantaged strategies from 401k to Roth to backdoor to FSAs to whatever. To build a long term financial plan and track against it and advise what similar clients in my age / income bracket are doing and spending.   All of this requires you to actually have conversations with your advisor. If you plan to set it and forget it, open a vanguard account, buy VOO, and walk away until near retirement.

I am curious to get some input on this.   Thanks in advance!,"If you are the only employee then a solo 401k is a very good easy option. Pretty much a no-brainer if you are already maxing out your IRA. Fidelity has solo 401k plans with zero fees.  You can contribute $23k as the ""employee"" and up to 20% of the net business income as the ""employer"".  Yes I get the terms employee and employer are a bit weird when self employed but that is how the IRS defines it to keep it consistent with ""real"" 401(k)s.  These limits would be on top of an IRA ($7k).  So if you had $100k net business income you could contribute $23k as employee, ~$20k as employer, and $7 to your IRA for a total of up to $50k tax sheltered a year.  The max limit is $69k per year combined (plus $7k IRA) which would be possible with a net business income of $244k or more.  https://obliviousinvestor.com/solo-401k-contribution-calculator/  If you have any employees (other than spouse) you can't use a solo 401(k) and a ""real"" 401(k) involves significant cost and probably worth consulting with a financial advisor.

One annoying thing is contributions must be by company check (yes actual check) and sent by paper form.  Once contributions are made it works like any other Fidelity account but it is crazy it is so antiquated.  If your business doesn't already have an EIN that is an IRS requirement for opening a 401(k) so you would need to get one.  Any business can get an EIN even a sole prop.

I have some bitcoin invested but that‚Äôs about it.,"In the short-term, are you wanting to put money into this investment (to use a long time from now, like in retirement) or are you wanting to get money out (to spend in the next few months &amp; years)?  I'm guessing you're really interested in what you said in your 2nd paragraph - gradually building assets to spend later, but it's very important for you to think about what you're really trying to do.  I retired at 57 years old.   Investing doesn't have to be complicated or costly to be successful; simple &amp; inexpensive is most effective.         I invest 100% in total-market, index-based, low-cost mutual funds. Specifically, I use mostly Vanguard's    Total Stock Market,    Total Bond Market,    Total International Stock Market, &amp;    Total International Bond Market funds.    I've been investing this way for 35+ years. It's effective, simple, &amp; inexpensive.        www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting\_started  has some great free resources to learn about investing. After a few hours reading the articles, and, especially, watching the Bogleheads Philosophy videos, most beginners can learn how to get better results than most professionals.  Bogleheads is named after John Bogle, founder of Vanguard.        My asset allocation (ratios of the funds mentioned) is based on my need, ability, &amp; willingness to take risks.  Market conditions are not a factor.  Vanguard's investor questionnaire (personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire) helps me determine my asset allocation.        Buying individual stocks or sector funds creates unnecessary &amp; uncompensated risk; I avoid doing so.  Index funds are boring, but better for making money.  If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 5-10% of my portfolio in individual stocks.  As it is, I own pretty much every publicly-traded company in the world; that's interesting enough for me.        All of the individual stocks &amp; sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors.  Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one.  I'm a member of the Triple Nine Society, but I'm not smarter than all of them.  If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.        I prefer mutual funds, but ETFs could also work well.  The differences are usually trivial for a long-term investor, especially if they're the Vanguard funds I mentioned above.  Actually, the Vanguard funds I mentioned above have both traditional mutual fund shares &amp; ETF shares; they both represent a piece of the same fund.        The funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds; these are excellent choices for many investors.  Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically.  Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors.        Other companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because they've been the leader in this type of investing for decades &amp; because Vanguard's customers are also Vanguard's owners.        I hope that helps!

If you have pre-tax money in your Traditional IRAs, the pro-rata rule will apply when you do the backdoor Roth, and you'll get taxed on the portion of pre-tax money that converts to ROTH.   The pro-rata rule means that when money is distributed from your IRA (which happens as part of the Traditional IRA -&gt; ROTH conversion), the distributed amount is considered to have the same proportions of pre-tax : post-tax money as overall IRA account balance proportions. And then you get taxed on the pre-tax portion of the distribution.   Example:  Current Traditional IRA = $100K pre-tax money and $0 post-tax money.   Which is 100% pre-tax, 0% post-tax.   Then you put $7K of post-tax money in the Traditional IRA for the backdoor ROTH.   Now your IRA is 93.5% pre-tax and 6.5% post-tax.  Then you convert $7K from Traditional IRA -&gt; ROTH.  The $7K conversion is considered $6.55K pre-tax (93.5%) and $455 post-tax (6.5%). And you'll get taxed on the pre-tax portion.   So...what you can do is...if your current 401k plan accepts rollovers from pre-tax Traditional IRA funds, you can roll all your Traditional IRA funds into your 401k.  This will zero out your Traditional IRA balance. Now you can do the backdoor ROTH. Because when you put $7K into the Traditional IRA, now the balance will be 0% pre-tax, 100% post-tax. So the conversion to ROTH will be 100% post-tax and you won't get taxed again.  Also the IRS considers all your IRAs as one IRA balance. So you'd need to zero out both your Traditional IRA accounts.  I'd recommend consulting a tax professional before doing anything to confirm the right pathway to handle this for your situation.","With two rollover IRAs ostensibly having 100% pre-tax balances, you can‚Äôt make a true backdoor Roth contribution.   You would need to convert your IRAs to a Roth IRA first, paying owed taxes, and then you‚Äôd be able to proceed with backdoor contributions going forward.","&gt; My (and wife‚Äôs) employer offers a 401k but I‚Äôm not currently contributing to it; neither is she (no match; saving for a house so need liquidity soon, among other reasons)  I think you're asking the wrong question here. According to this sentence, neither of you appear to be saving for retirement. That's a huge problem. A house is not a substitute for retirement.   You are a high income family living in a high tax state. You should both be making substantial Traditional 401(k) contributions.  In addition you said your wife's 401(k) doesn't offer a match but you skipped over whether your employer does.","and what this means is that your withdrawals are not taxed, nor are your *trades*.  That's a big deal.  I went without rebalancing my portfolio for a very long time because the transactions - even if I didn't actually remove any net money from the account - would be taxed.",Thanks for this. I was talking to a friend who works in finance and he mentioned pro-rata. He couldn't explain it too well but this kind of helps. But this never gets mentioned in any tutorials or anything like that. And the implications of tax.,"Generally, the advice for high earners (ie, those in the 35% marginal bracket or hihger) is to prioritize traditional, since the tax benefit is substantial.   However, once you're in that bracket it's pretty easy to find $7000 to do the Roth backdoor.","To be fair, trades aren‚Äôt taxed in a traditional IRA either but you‚Äôll obviously pay the taxes upon withdrawal",This should be way higher up.

It‚Äôs been doing ok with current fund allocation.   I am not working (oooof layoffs), so I don‚Äôt have a current 401k.    Question is: is there any compelling reason to leave it as a 401k vs rolling it into an IRA?",Having pre-tax funds in an IRA will prevent you from doing a backdoor Roth IRA contribution in the future if you exceed the income limits to contribute to a Roth IRA directly.,"1. If you need to retire before 59.5, willingly or unwillingly.  2. 401k has ERISA protections, IRAs do not.  3. Similar to 2, if you suddenly have a large financial liability, your IRA may be garnished based on state laws, but your 401k cannot.",Ahhhh yes that‚Äôs a good one.   Interestingly some of it is already roth because it had in plan conversions. So I could roll the Roth portion to Roth IRA and keep the non roth as 401k to roll to my next employer plan (whenever the heck that is!).,"Do NOT roll 401K pretax into IRA ever! Always roll it into your new employer 401K. The reasons are 1) If you roll 401K money into IRA you‚Äôll lose the ability to do back door Roth IRA unless you want to be subject to pro rata rules (google if you don‚Äôt know what it is but the long story short is you‚Äôll get hammered with tax which is the exact opposite you try to do with retirement accounts), 2) 401K is better insulator from creditors if you ever get into debt trouble and 3) USUALLY depending on your 401K you‚Äôll have some perks - access to lower expense investments, able to speak to advisors, loans, etc.","401k rollovers are done in cash. The investments aren't transferred. So your old plan would sell your investments, then send the cash to your more current one. You would then choose how to invest the money between the options in your current plan.   Rollovers and selling within a 401k aren't taxable events.   Yes, not having a traditional IRA balance keeps your option to do a backdoor Roth IRA open.   Admin fees, expense ratios, and fund choices are all good reasons to do a rollover.","No. Roll it, don't lose money to fees. Once you have a new job and the fund options aren't completely ass, roll it into the new 401k to keep the slate clean for backdoor Roth IRA conversions.","As long as you don't put non-payroll contributions into the IRA before you roll it back into a 401k plan, you can move a Rollover IRA back into a 401k.",When I ran into this problem I was able to roll my traditional IRA into my current 401k.

Also what stocks / ETFs are you buying right now to hold long term?,"I‚Äôm paying close attention to a small number of industries in 2024 ranging from oil tankers to food supply-chain track &amp; trace, however, lithium is at the very top of my watchlist.   The lithium supply chain (prospectors, mines, refineries, et al) will be within the blast radius of massive tailwinds as the demand for lithium will continue growing at an expedited rate with a compound annual growth rate of 12% to 20% (depending on what you read).     EV‚Äôs are the obvious lithium catalyst driven by strict adoption mandates across the EU, US, and Asia. For context on this, a Tesla model S' battery contains around 62.6 kg (138 pounds) of lithium and roughly 2 billion EVs need to be on the road by 2050 for the world to hit net zero emissions - the demand / growth potential of lithium industry is something unprecedented. There‚Äôs not much to compare it with and no, it hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù.     Also, let‚Äôs not forget the impact of global relations on lithium and other base metal supply chains. We‚Äôre seeing a repatriation of the manufacturing base back to the western world which in this case will favour domestic and near shore lithium projects (Canada and Mexico will likely be the biggest beneficiaries of this).   I‚Äôm currently placing my long term bets in the industry and am bullish on a small number of stocks:   $ALB - My safety net play   One of the biggest lithium juggernauts rn with an extensive global portfolio. They hold the title of largest provider of lithium for EV batteries in the world. Albemarle is on a path of industry consolidation via aggressive M&amp;A (This trend is expected to continue in 2024 and beyond).     $LIFT.V - My parabolic growth play   One of the most robust early stage lithium projects I‚Äôve come across in Northern America. If you know anything about junior miners you know how drill test results play a key role in assessing the potential value of a company/stock. I recommend reading into these. Just by looking at publicly available drill hole data, I believe we could see a total resource of 60+ million tonnes, which would mean and estimate 1-1.4 million tonnes LCE resource.

Automaker margins are already paper thin and will continue to be compressed. Add to this that the EV industry iterates very quickly and automakers like Ford, etc will struggle with getting rid of first gen models (massive discounts inbound).     The lithium mining/refining space however will continue to flourish. 60% to 80% of lithium deposits recently announced  just aren't commercially viable (geography, drill costs, international relations, etc). This is a strong catalyst for domestic / near shore lithium mining / refining.

I have $40,000 in emergency savings based on my current lifestyle which would keep me afloat for one year. Should I potentially lose my employment.   With all that said- if i put the extra money left over towards my mortgage instead of investing it in the stock market with historical being the market having gained around 20% on a really good year in a bull market, what would make the most sense??

Prepaying the mortgage principal, over the next 3 years...  - You're seeing a cumulative 9.89% return on the $125,000 or $12,524 saved.  Note you don't see a flat or yearly 3.375% return on the $125 due to how mortgages are calculated with fixed monthly payments.   - For comparison with markets, that's making $3,561, $4,406, $4,557 respectively (year 1,2,3) due to reduced interest obligation on each payment. (No, that's right.  Y1 has less interest saved than Y3.  Look at an amortization schedule if you don't believe me.  This is what makes mortgages evil if you aren't living there for a long time - banks take their cut first).    - The total interest on the mortgage drops from $296,000 to $137,000.  You save $159,000 over 30 years, guaranteed.    Investing in the markets instead...  - Remember these are some of the wildest swings the market has every seen, back-to-back.  +26% in year 1, -20% in year 2, and +24% in year 3.    - After year 1, you're up $32,500.  If you sell, you're paying short-term capital gains, so you shave off anywhere from to $3.2k to $12k in taxes, for a final return of at least $20.5k or a net return of $17k.  Congratulations.  You've timed the market.     - After year 2, you're now up just a tiny $1k on your $125k investment.  Pulling out now would put you roughly where you started after capital gains and other brokerage fees.  You're at a net loss of ~$8k with the opportunity cost of the not putting that into the mortgage instead.  This is why timing the market is bad.    - After year 3, you didn't panic and left it in.  You're now up to $156k.  If you sell now, you're likely at the 15% capital gains bracket and pull out about ~$26k profit less brokerage fees for ~$151k.   You'd have saved $12.5k in the mortgage, giving you a net profit of ~13.5k.    Said another way with a little more obfuscation (read fuzzy math):   - If you put $125k in year 1 into the mortgage then you save $159,000 in interest payments you don't have to pay (payoff in May. 2043).  This means the house cost you $511,686.51 in interest and principal.    - If you would have put the $125k in the S&amp;P in 2021 and then pulled it out to put $151k into the mortgage in year 3, you're saving $154,686.86 in interest over the lifetime of the mortgage (payoff in Jul. 2042).  This means the house cost you $490,086.32 in interest and principal.   - Net savings of about $21,600 over 30 years."

These amount exclude interest and dividends reinvested in 2024, and this also excludes my pension which I pay over $6k/year into automatically.

investing,Jan,19b7uyu,Not all time high in swiss franks,I want to give you all a different view on the all time highs.  Yes in dollar terms you have reached ATH. But the USA has suffered inflation.  Switzerland had much lower inflation and therefore the dollar depreciated. For swiss investors (somewhat inflation protected) we are more than 10% from ATH.   Considering that the stock market appreciates over time as economies grow and now additionaly the dollar has devalued new ATHs in dollar terms seem very reasonable. Everyone thinks the market is overvalued but what would you excpect when there wasnt a serious recession?  Keep cool and follow your long term plans.,"Sure, the ATH is kind of arbitrary. If you adjust for dividends, it was already at all time highs. But if you take out buybacks, the market cap isn't at all time highest. Similarly if you adjust for inflation it isn't at ATHs, but if you adjust for money supply it already was at ATHs.  Its not a precise thing, but interesting psychologically because of the amount of bad sentiment thought out the last two years. Yet here we are at all time highs nominally.","in switzerland, you don't need to buy a swiss bank account.","I love swiss franks (in particular, St. Galler Olma Bratwurst) :) ... at least in American English, franks = hot dogs.   I think you mean francs?!",What?,"It's also not an all-time high in real dollars, because we've had 2 years with 8.7% and 3.2% inflation since the previous high.","And elephants aren't actually mammals, but a large species of flightless bird.  What? It's just as accurate as your ""fact"".","People adjusting for inflation on ATH assets everywhere lately don't make much sense to me.  ATH is a psychological barrier, any market of exchange or derivatives has buyers and sellers and the side in control pushes price in their favor. Buyers who buy here are not thinking, ""oh well this is not real ATH inflation-adjusted so it's still got room to go to real ATH"" and neither are the sellers.  SPX just reached ATHs yesterday since a few years past. It's not ATH inflation-adjusted and neither are the numerous other ATH's of the past if you inflation-adjust every single one. But the numbers have buyer and seller psychology at play and supply&amp;demand is economics 101. There is demand which is what creates higher highs. Inflation-adjusting these numbers, especially when they took years to develop is just silly. The side that controls the price to these new levels don't think like that.","Yes, it's strange how chart makers often chart nominally in the short term and only switch to real if looking over decades.

investing,Jan,1905psq,What to watch out for before getting into annuity?,I am 62 with plans to retire in a year or two.  I have about 800k in investments and now considering an annuity.  One that is presented to me is Nassau Bonus with 10% bonus and 10% market cap.  Although it sounds safe and reasonable I am still hesitant.  Planning to put half of my money there for 10 years.  In a few years I can start getting up to 10% out of it to supplement SS and pension if need to.  On a surface everything checks out - any advice on what to look out for or better choices to consider?,Annuities are tricky.  You might want to see if there are penalties for early withdrawals in case of emergency or whatever.  Is there a reason you don‚Äôt want to stay in investments like the stock market or even a 4-5% savings account?  That way all your money is always available to you.,"I spent $420k on an annuity ten years ago. A similar amount I had in stocks doubled within four years, making me feel foolish about the annuity. I started drawing 30k(guaranteed minimum) per year after five years and it supplements my pension and SS nicely. The contract has riders for assisted care and leaves a $250k inheritance for my heirs when I pass. After the uneven markets we have had since then, I have more appreciation of the certain income. Had I made the right moves, I could have done much better, but there's many a slip between the cup and the lip.",What you need to watch out for is the fees - how much of your 800K you'll lose once the annuity company takes their cut.  An interesting exercise would be to lay out what you plan to extract (withdraw) from the annuity and when - and see how that would compare with you achieving the same thing with the 800K - invested/managed without an annuity.  Having data like:  What is your SS and when will you start taking it?  How much is your pension and when does it start?  What are your anticipated total expenses?  I'd venture to guess (won't say it's a certainty since there aren't yet detailed numbers) you'll come out ahead if you don't do the annuity - as long as the 800K is managed appropriately.,Saying all annuities bad is naive. That‚Äôs a blanket statement and shows you don‚Äôt understand what the word annuity means.  They are expensive and can be very gimmicky but the right annuity for the right situation can be very appropriate.,Why don‚Äôt you start with letting us know why you are considering an annuity? And what you plan to do with the other half of your money.,&gt; I can't pull this money out without paying tax if I want to put it into long term CDs.  An IRA with any of the major brokerage firms will allow you to purchase CDs within the IRA.  United States Treasuries might be another option.,"They‚Äôre considering the annuity because they are 62, about to retire and want insurance and downside protection on their principal.  If the market performs well, they‚Äôre obviously do much better outside the annuity.  If it tanks, they could risk their ability to retire.  Some people use annuities to have market exposure without all the risk of being naked in the markets.","You're clearly paying for something here. You need to figure out *how much* you're paying for it. I have my doubts regarding the value.   Have you run any numbers to see how much you're leaving on the table in order to gain (possibly perceived) stability? You're definitely leaving something on the table, but it's hard to tell how much without running numbers through historical returns. You also have zero protection from inflation if I understand the ""deal"". Is that correct? So if inflation hits hard and the market goes up, you will barely make any real money that year. You're also stuck in the annuity unless you pay some nasty fees, I would guess.   The S&amp;P 500 trends upwards over a long time, but those gains can often happen in large chunks. There are far fewer of the down years that you are seeking out protection against. So it seems like you are sacrificing a lot of regularly occurring, large magnitude upside to protect against a limited occurring, smaller magnitude downside.   https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns","He won‚Äôt lose any money upfront from fees. That‚Äôs not how it works.  It hinders performance, doesn‚Äôt take a chunk of upfront performance.","I‚Äôve worked in finance for 20 years and don‚Äôt sell annuities.  It‚Äôs just annoying when people say ‚Äúannuities are bad‚Äù.   It shows they don‚Äôt understand how many variations there are and when they are appropriate.   An immediate annuity, fixed annuity, variable annuity, variable annuity with living benefits, indexed annuity etc. are all very different things.   Saying all annuities are bad for everyone is dumb."
investing,Jan,1aem899,Backdoor Roth conversion timing,"If I am contributing to my traditional IRA with the intent to convert it into a Roth using the back door method, does the timing matter as long as it is only done once a year? Specifically, should I do it in December, January, or is that not relevant? I don't have the $7,000 to plunk down once a year, so I contribute to it throughout the year without investing it in anything(to avoid tax on gains) and then roll it all over before investing.","&gt;does the timing matter as long as it is only done once a year?  There is no limit to how many Roth conversions you can perform. You just need to stay within the annual contribution limit for the contributions that you make to the Traditional IRA.  &gt;I contribute to it throughout the year without investing it in anything(to avoid tax on gains)  Avoiding gains in order to avoid taxes doesn‚Äôt make sense, it‚Äôs impossible for the taxes to be more than the gains.","Never let the tax tail wag the investment dog.  While everyone dislikes paying taxes, HIGH taxes are proof that you're ""winning"" the investment game.  Keeping your taxes low *relative* to your assets is certainly strategically smart, but avoiding investing in order to avoid taxes is not.","I'm not certain but I think so.  Usually when you do the original contribution, the form asks you what year the contribution is for. And IRA contbution deadlines are the same as tax filing deadlines.  I believe the contribution is documented for the tax year you select when making the contribution.  But the conversion gets documented in the tax year of the conversion.  I can't speak to how this would have to be handled on your taxes.","To piggy back (I seem to get contradictory results on google)-  Can I still backdoor my Roth for 2023 now?  I have the money sitting in a traditional IRA which I transferred in Dec but messed up the timing and it took like Fidelity 6 business days to recognize it, which took me into January 3rd before the funds were realized.    Too late to backdoor for 2023 (I will also do so for 2024)",[deleted],"&gt; You can also do a Roth conversion after every contribution immediately, but this does make tax filing a bit annoying.  How does it make it more annoying? I‚Äôm pretty sure only the total amounts contributed and converted are reported, number of times you do it doesn‚Äôt matter","This. Last year for the first time I did multiple backdoor ROTHs on Schwab and Im looking at my 1099 R right now, and all I see is one entry for 6500.","CFP here. You can still do your backdoor contribution for both years if you'd like. You may have to file a form with Fidelity to make sure your contributions are backdated (""recharacterized"") for 2023 instead of 2024, but I would call to confirm first. When you do your conversion, it would be a tax reportable event in 2024, but you can convert as much as you like as often as you like in the tax year, so you'll just wind up converting two years' contributions this year. If you have positive earnings on those contributions prior to the conversion, you may have to include those as taxable income for 2024.  Be sure to file IRS Form 8606 with your tax return for your non-deductible IRA contributions.",I still cannot understand why individuals are so worried about taxes on any potential growth of a backdoor Roth. Tripping over dollars to pick up quarters...   Either setup a monthly backdoor conversion and invest or invest each month then convert.,It's a really simple process. I use Schwab and they have both accounts set up ready to go before you even fund them. I usually fund the traditional and then convert the next day.

How much of this exchange rate effect accounts for the relative underperformance of VTIAX vs. VTSAX?","I didn't find a resource that answers this automatically, and this may need a bit of work to answer properly manually since VTIAX holds at least 59 different countries ([Taken from here at least](https://stockanalysis.com/quote/mutf/VTIAX/holdings/)). That said at least 25% of VTIAX is from European Union countries which makes the task slightly less daunting.  From the top countries it looks like the USD buying power is probably affecting the price by about 20% what it would be denominated in foreign currency, using a probably overly naive `$1 USD = X foreign` base point and comparing `((Jan 2024 price) / (Jan 2014 price) - 1) * (2024 VTIAX Holding Pct)`. For example, $1 USD = 104.84 JPY in Jan 2014 and 145.79 JPY now, so since Japan companies make up 15% of VTIAX today that would account for about `145.79 / 104.85 =&gt; 1.39 =&gt; +39% * 15% =&gt; +5.9%` effect on the VTIAX price in USD compared to the growth those holdings would have had in JPY (Assuming VTIAX didn't change its holdings proportions at all between 2014 and 2024, which is an absolutely faulty assumption).  Adding that up for JPY, GBP, CND, CNY, EUR, AUD, and INR gives a total weighted effect of about +20%.","Yeah international markets have lagged a lot over the past 10 years. Not only have economies lagged, but international stocks tend to have much higher weight to financials with very little growth tech. The divergence really took off around 10 years ago. However now a lot of European stocks are at attractive valuations and pay relatively high dividends, things may be quite different over the next 10 years. Also Japan might return to growth.","US companies do a lot of business overseas so they don't necessarily benefit entirely from a strong US dollar. The out performance of US is due mainly to the technology sector and economic growth of the US. Now maybe that growth and attractive of big tech companies is because the US is the dominate economy and reserve currency. So it could be an indirect thing, but just having a strong currency alone I don't think is the direct reason.","Oh that's interesting, thanks for running the numbers. Seems like the effect is small compared to the overall underperformance of ~150% over 10yrs","If you are asking about U.S. stocks vs. Ex U.S. developed the risk return profiles should be similar so one should expect similar returns over time.  But as you noted they really aren't of late. Why?  You guessed it... U.S. dollar dominance is likely a big factor.    Jeremy Seigel in his excellent book ""Stocks for the long run"" has several pages and table dedicated to his EXACT idea.  If interested I would scan through it.  When dollar is strong U.S. will outperform and when weak Ex US DEVELOPED will outperform.    Go read his book.  He should know few things considering he is full professor at Wharton Business School at U Penn","No problem.  Book itself is not that great, but does have some excellent tables/ graphs especially of stock data WAY BACK even before Alfred Cowles started collecting data.",The strong dollar is likely a major factor in VTIAX lagging VTSAX recently. International stocks face currency headwinds when priced in dollars. might be worth sticking with your allocation until the dollar weakens again.,Thanks for the book rec!,"Strong US dollar is the result of funds overperforming relative to their own country, not the other way around.    In the place I live, nobody does their long term savings or investments in local currency but almost everyone is using US dollar.  This drives up the demand for US dolloar.  The reason is you need US dollar to buy US stocks and bonds.  The return of SP500 is super good and there is no reason to invest in other indices.    If US market performs poorly, the values of US dollar will go down.",80-20 is a great option so keep up the good work
investing,Jan,19epe29,Made My First Investment At 20.,"Just bought 2 shares of AMD and 1 share of Nvidia all for $1000.   Thoughts? I invested in Nvidia due to them being a leader in AI hardware and AMD due to their growing server market share. I'm debating on grabbing some Intel too due to them possibly become a chip fabricator. They're losing consumer and server market share but still retain market share in pre-builts so they could just ditch it in the future and just fabricate chips for other companies.  I was told to expand my portfolio so I plan on doing so. Is there any other sector besides the tech and overall market (VOO/ NASDAQ) that I should invest in? All the companies I can think of are all tech related, which I mean makes sense because tech is the #1 selling thing to consumers and companies. Just wanted to make sure.  I make $1400 a month, have $500 in bills and plan on investing a large some of cash every paycheck. Should I diversify it above all 3 companies? Throw it in VOO? Open a savings account with a high APY? My bank has a .01% interest rate so it made more sense for me to invest it than to let it sit.  This is my first time investing and I'm all for any advice you have to give. Thanks.","Congrats, but also a hell of a time to buy both.",Hes gonna learn an important lesson either way. Cheap tuition.,"For future reference, and I mean this sincerely, please take your money and invest 60-80% of it in VOO, VTI, or some combination of the two. With that 20-30%  remaining invest it in cool, interesting plays you may have. I say this because you're buying into AMD/NVIDIA when it's already very high. Maybe not AMD, but definitely NVIDIA. At some point, it's gonna go down and down by a lot.   And even with VOO/VTI, you are investing in both those stocks, along with other great companies like MSFT, APPL, GOOG, AMZN, etc. It's just a better way to not put all your eggs in one basket.","Then don't invest in it. If you don't understand it, why would you buy it?","I‚Äôd advise not to get too overzealous on AMD and NVIDIA. they‚Äôre both on some pretty nutty uptrends (NVIDIA especially.)   While they are in fact great companies, I wouldn‚Äôt put a cent into either specifically at these levels. They‚Äôre both way too overvalued at this point fundamentally. It‚Äôs just riding the AI hype train mostly.   Keep what you have if you wish. But I‚Äôd start buying other companies not associated that are strong and reasonably priced. But also be mentally prepared for your initial investments to potentially lose 70%+ value at some point.","Nicely done! Congratulations on your first investment.  The reason that people are saying to put your money into VOO is because it‚Äôs already diversified and VOO has holdings in the major tech like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. By putting your money into VOO you are allowing financial experts to maintain a diversified portfolio instead of you having to directly diversify the portfolio yourself.  [VOO on Investopedia.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121814/look-vanguards-sp-500-etf.asp)","Buying 2 chip stocks, at all time highs as your first and only investment is a dangerous game. When your down 30% might leave a bad taste in your mouth.   I'd want to diversify but sometimes losing money helps you learn the lesson before you make the msotake with a lot of money.","Screw all these comments telling you these companies are overvalued. You're 20. Keep these stocks for 50 years so you can show your grand kids a cool ass +10,000% trade.  Going forward, throwing all your extra money in VOO is ~~an~~ *~~excellent~~* ~~idea~~ perfect.","The thing about AI is it reminds me of the internet hype. (Even the blockchain hype of crypto.) Yes it‚Äôs a great technology. Yes it‚Äôs going to be a big part of the world. But it takes time for this stuff to actually make a difference. AI realistically probably has a handful of years away before it‚Äôs really integrated. And it very well not be fully what you imagined it to be too.   While I don‚Äôt invest in these companies specifically, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good to have the SCHG fund. It‚Äôs heavily weighted on all the largest American tech companies. Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, etc. not an overwhelming part of a portfolio. But a decent portion so you aren‚Äôt crushed if tech falls off, but also reap the benefits of it going up.   Most people will recommend stuff like SPY, VOO, SCHD, VTI. All are decent options. I highly recommend sticking to a few (usually only one for a newcomer is plenty fine.) And just take more time to learn investing along the way while you build up. I highly recommend listening to a guy named Peter Lynch. He offers a great amount of wisdom and insight on investing. It‚Äôll really help. Trust me.","It sounds to me like you are trying to account for variables that you really don‚Äôt need to be worrying about until they actually happen. I‚Äôm going to revisit the questions you asked at the bottom of your post.  If you are planning to put a large chunk of your income into investments each month then there are a few things to consider.  You need to build up an emergency fund. A good way to do that is to pile some of your money into a savings account with a high APY around 5%. How you do this is calculate your monthly spending and expenses. Multiply that number by the number of months you want to save. If you are spending $500 a month and you want 3 months of emergency funds. Then you would need to put $1500 away. You don‚Äôt touch this money unless you really need it. Ideally, all you should be doing is adding to this fund.  Honestly, if your bank is only getting you 0.1% then you should move all or most of the money out of it. Your money should be making a minimum of 4% each year just to combat [yearly inflation.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/244983/projected-inflation-rate-in-the-united-states/)  I‚Äôd consider making two savings accounts. One account that you save for an emergency fund and another savings account that you use for investing. That way your investments are earning the baseline savings rate at minimum.  I‚Äôd also consider starting an IRA or other retirement account. Any money you put in now will massively grow due to compounding gains.  You have to set obtainable financial goals for yourself. For example, something like: * $1,500 into emergency fund. * $1,500 into retirement. * $5,000 into high yield savings account. * $10,000 into investing. * $18,000 into retirement."

investing,Jan,19coqlp,Suspected churning stock broker,"My father-in-law recently passed away. I'm helping my mother-in-law get her finances in order and when we got control over her late husband's retirment account we found some really strange activity. For example, in just January of this year alone, they have bought and sold $150,000+ of ETFs. They will do things like sell 40k-50k of one type of ETF, and then turn around and buy the same type of security with a different stock ticker. Their advisory fees seem like they are pretty standard and I can't find if commission was made on these trades . Does anyone know of a way to investigate this without confronting the brokerage firm? I feel like this stuff should be disclosed, but from what I'm reading online, maybe these crooks get to keep it a secret? I'm also interested in reporting them to the SEC or FINRA. I'm a little overwhelmed right now, the account has lost a lot of money and the whole family is upset.",Is this a taxable brokerage account? Are they tax loss harvesting? It‚Äôs kind of hard to know if something shady is going on without more details.   Why do you not want to confront them? Schedule a meeting and ask for an explanation. You could hire another flat fee financial advisor to go over the account for you if you wanted to make sure everything was on the up and up and couldn‚Äôt figure it out yourself.,"Tax loss harvesting is a way to improve the after tax return of your taxable investments. Was the only reason I could think of for them to be selling ETFs and then buying very similar ETFs.  Not something I do because all of my money is in tax advantaged accounts, but it is a legitimate strategy in a taxable accounts.  Here is a link explaining it. Definitely ask them for an explanation. If this isn‚Äôt it yeah it sounds pretty shady.  [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_loss_harvesting](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_loss_harvesting)","When you say you got control, I presume the account is in your mother-in-law name now.  If not, you need to inform them that your father-in-law has passed away.  You‚Äôll probably need to furnish them with a death certificate, etc.  It sounds like it‚Äôs a discretionary investment account where the brokers can initiate trades without your consent.  If you change it to a non-discretionary account, they‚Äôll need to get your consent before making a trade.  All my investment accounts are non-discretionary.  My advisor calls me about once a quarter to potentially rebalance my accounts.  We talk about it and if I agree, he makes the trades.","It‚Äôs not ‚Äúconfrontational‚Äù to ask your advisor/broker to explain their trading activity. Just do it in a non-confrontational tone and don‚Äôt assume that they were churning the account.  My bet is that they were tax loss harvesting.  Those losses can carry over indefinitely so just because she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù the losses now, doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt helpful to offset gains now or in the future.

Client and advisor SHOULD be discussing the accounts to prevent your exact situation.",Thank you!,"The s&amp;p in 2022 was down almost 20%, depending on when those positions were opened, selling them for a loss is very possible.   Others have mentioned tax loss harvesting. Buying and selling at the beginning of the year and end respectively is a common strategy.

I suspect it was false trading. Just made up trades to devalue the account‚Ä¶.which it did. Like every trade was a loss.   She got her money out with a statement and it was brutal. Just losses trade after lost trade. Some of the trades were out of range for the trading day.   She didn‚Äôt want to chase the issue and just closed the account because a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù worked there and recommended him.,Buying and selling ETF‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt produce commissions and most are free everywhere. If they were load based mutual funds you might be correct.  At the end of the year there will be tax loss harvesting followed by a quarterly rebalance and that is probably what you‚Äôre seeing.,No problem.   Switching to Vanguard could be a good idea. They even have a pretty cheap wealth management service if your mother-in-law still wants someone else to handle the investments for her and you do not want to take it on yourself.  Fidelity is also good if you want to go self managed. Their wealth management service is kind of expensive though.,"Almost half of it is taxable, the other half is in IRAs. She doesn't need to harvest any losses, would there be a benefit to the broker for losing money?  My mother in law is going to call this week and tell them to hold all investments and not make any moves for now. I think it might come to a meeting, but I'm not very confrontational. That's good advice about another financial advisor, I was thinking about going to Fidelity or Vanguard and just moving everything, but maybe a review beforehand would be prudent."
investing,Jan,1999cex,What market trends are you BULLISH on for 2024?,"Hey all! Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn‚Äôt wanna go overboard   **Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**   The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.     **GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**   Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.   **Uranium (BHP, NXE )**   The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.   &amp;#x200B;  Are you betting on any of these? If not what are you looking at?",Cash -- 5.25% Federal Funds Rate will continue for longer than anyone expects.,You can dog pile me but crypto.   Specifically BTC with the halving in a few months and Ethereum with a quite possible ETF this spring. (The second one is assuming the SEC doesn't want to go through another spectacularly losing round in the courts)   We now have JPmorgan shilling ETH on CNBC (see Dillons comments fell the other day) and Larry Fink from Black rock saying he sees tokenization on Ethereum as the future of the financial system.   Maybe just shilling their bags but they're backing it up with their own ETF filings so I'm here for it.,And if the market returns negative over the next 5 years you‚Äôll be changing your tune.,"Okay but inflation is 2-4%. 5.25% nets you like, 2.25%? The opportunity cost there is pretty bad.",I agree Uranium will continue to boom in 2024 but I like URNM.,You mean 30% gains over 5 years.  Which stock are you investing into that will have a chance of 30% gains over the next 5 years?,"The SP500 over 2 years is basically 0%. Or in terms of inflation, -14% or so.",I guess but I‚Äôd rather risk that than guarantee just 11.25% over 5 years.,"&gt; Mathematically it simply has to increase in value when all other factors are taken into account  I mean... do they?  If a company is generating revenue, products, even if a ton of people start dumping that stock someone who is doing the math on how profitable the company is going to buy it back up because the underlying property you are purchasing is worth something.  Bitcoins are mathematically scarce, but they are perpetuated just by the fact that someone is buying them. Otherwise, they are worthless? The tech is also become stale/out of date from the perspective of other blockchain.","I am very bullish for Agents. I am old and read about them for over 30 years now and it seems we are finally here where you can have one that adds a lot of value. Basically something that can take care of your sh*t.  We finally have the technology to make possible. I suspect Google is where we will get the best consumer agents.  Key is search. There is nothing digital that tells you more about someone. So using the 10+ years of my search queries is a great basis for an agent.  But then Google has Google Maps which has everywhere I have gone for the last 10+ years. Then add in all my email, photos, etc.  But what really sets Google apart is the TPUs. That was so smart to develop over a decade ago.  Now on the sixth generation with the fifth recently deployed.  This allowed Google to complete do Gemini without any Nvidia. Nobody else can do that.  It is a bit of a headscratcher on why Microsoft did not get it a lot earlier. Only now starting their TPU effort.  Why on earth did they not copy Google far earlier? It is not like the TPUs have been a secret for the last decade+. Heck they shared in papers."

investing,Feb,1aj4c8b,"A story of hope - $1,000,000","7 years ago I hit rock bottom - I found out my wife was having an affair which led to a divorce and caused myself and my two kids to move back into my parents house because I could not afford my house payment   At the time I had $15,000 in retirement and lived pay check to pay check.  At that time I made $60,000 a year  I got serious about my money at that time and started to budget.  I also focused on my savings rate and at least save 20% - 30% into retirement   A year after the divorce I met a great girl and we got married.  She brought $80,000 of retirement money into our family which gave us about $100,000 in our 403b.  At the time she made $50,000.  7 years later we are making $200,000 a year and have been saving 30% and we now have a net worth over $1,000,000  We still enjoyed vacations, travel sports so we def have not stopped living life.  My biggest advice is we drove cheap cars ( we both have Honda accords that are older) so we never did car payments and used the cheapest car insurance .  A hot stock market helped but now I realize it‚Äôs more about savings rate than anything else and just live within your means and eliminate unnecessary debt.

It‚Äôs good to put some away because you effectively increase your pay by avoiding tax but like you said you got a life to live also. You hopefully will find in the future your rate of pay increases faster than your living expenses and you‚Äôll have more to save.","Of course maxing these is after your monthly expenses.  If you're going to save for a house,  I'd save in a higher interest savings like Marcus or Ally.  Don't let the money sit with your big bank as it'll earn nothing in interest.",It‚Äôs in the sidebar of r/personalfinance,"So, I am not a financial advisor. All I can offer is my own experience. I started out poor and worked my way up to about 200k/year over the course of my life. I'm 40 years old, own a home, and have a reasonable net worth.  Step one, assuming you have a steady place to live and all your necessities, is to build an emergency fund in a HYSA. This emergency fund should cover 3 months worth of bills plus 3 months worth of day to day necessities. Think ""enough to live on for 3 months if I lost my job today"". You're young, so the amount you need in your emergency fund will likely go up over time.  Next step is to max your 401 to your employer match, assuming you can afford to. You can go higher than that, and it will make a huge difference in 30 years, but it's hard to do that when you're trying to make huge purchases like your first home. And you don't want to be cash poor because you're squirreling all your money away for retirement, which you may or may not live long enough to enjoy. But you still want to try to max it to your employer match (which in my case is 5%) because if you don't, you're literally losing out on free money.  Once you do that, build enough padding into your HYSA so if you have to make a big purchase, like a down payment on a car, or new appliances, etc., you can borrow against your own money instead of using an interest-bearing credit card (its more nuanced than that - sometimes you would want to make the purchase on the cc for the perks such as longer warranty or cash back, but you still pay that off right away from your HYSA).  Next steps are kind of your preference. For me, I wanted to be able to know precisely how much money i had in checking without having to do math like ""well the car payment and the netflix bill come out of this check so i actually only have x left"", so i made a 2nd checking account just for bills. I calculated how much my bills are per check, added a little to that to cover variables like the electric bill, and funded that account to cover one paycheck worth of bills. Then I set up direct deposit so that i could throw all my bills on autopay and never have to think about it again. Now, when my primary checking acct says I have $500 left, I know that I truly have $500 of spending money left to cover groceries, gas, and that new game that just came out that I want.  Now, whatever I have left over in my primary checking acct at the end of the check goes either to investments (s&amp;p 500), or to a separate savings acct so I can save up for a large purchase (depending on how long you need to save up - if you plan on saving a huge down payment for the next 10+ years, a hysa might not be the optimal vehicle for it). This is how you get the down payment for your house.  One thing I do slightly different from most people I know is I never make a purchase with my debit card. I make all my purchases on a credit card and at the end of every pay period, I pay off that credit card. This solves/avoids a couple problems: 1. Nobody can get my debit card info and drain my bank acct. They can only steal my cc info, which will not leave me pennyless, and is easy to recover via my bank. 2. I always have a full paycheck worth of cash in my primary checking, which can be used in an ""emergency, break glass"" type situation.  Once you're to this point, you can think about how much you want to lock up in a tax-advantaged retirement acct. For me personally, I'd rather lose the tax advantage and have access to that money every time, because I ride the line between ""here for a good time not a long time"" and ""i want to be rich in my golden years"". If you're on track to have your house paid off and be able to pay cash for your cars by the time you retire, you don't need nearly as much money per month in retirement. I just plan on sitting on my porch, drinking coffee, smoking weed, and catching up on all those great books I've been collecting but never find the time to read.  Having a house is a wonderful feeling. If you make a plan based on what you want out of life, you'll have peace of mind. Most people are going to give you advice based on the old idea that you should live less comfortable during your working years so you can have a ton of money in retirement. Personally I don't subscribe to that because if I can't even make it to the toilet on time or climb stairs (assuming I even live that long), tf do I need extra spending money for? But that's just me and the argument can be made either way. I will have enough to live comfortably before and after I retire, and not feel bad about buying a nicer car now, or going on a lavish vacation with the wife and kids once in a while.  That may or may not answer your question. Hope it helps in some way.",The personal finance flowchart is very beginner friendly and an excellent resource!,My wife keeps me grounded. I‚Äôm saving like mad. She makes sure we enjoy some of the money we‚Äôre making. We have a great house. Take trips. Live life in the moment. But we both do have our retirements funds maxed and are making monthly investment.   One reason people will tell you to try to max the IRA is the tax issue. Your retirement gets funded before it is taxed. It costs you less to invest this way. The sooner you start investing this way the less you will miss it.   Lifestyle creep happens. The more you make the more you will spend. If you automate the investing you get the benefit of that growing while you just keep on living life with what‚Äôs in the bank.

In early days, especially when there's still non-house debt, ""max"" has different meanings, which often means this in this order. If at any stage, you can't afford that step, then do as much as you can, then (and thisis the important part that is too often omitted from one-liners like you quote):  NEVER STOP; Increase amounts at every opportunity (raise, bonus,  etc), move on to next step once TRUE max is hit.  1. Fund your emergency fund. 2. Always get your max match in 401k.  Eat ramen only if thats what it takes. 3. Start and max your Roth IRA at a cheap, fee-free brokerage. (Watch your income vs. the income limits that will eventually disqualify you from Roth if you make too much). 4. Increase your 401k to the IRS MAX.  This year, that's $23K. And yes, that's a lot.  Give it time. If you never reach the max due to income never getting there, try to increase your income (more training? Will they pay for it? New job(s)?) 5. Start the taxble brokerage account same place your Roth is. Put excess here (as your one-liner gets right).  &amp;#x200B;  Some notes:  * 1-2 can be done concurrently, and if you can't get to that max match, get a second gig so you can * 2-4 can all be done concurrently. As long as the money you put in keeps increasing, just aim for knocking all of these out eventually.  * 5: If you get here, you're doing amazingly well.  You may never. Usually the answer to finally getting there is better income.  Maybe dual incomes if you meet the right person. * The taxable brokerage can be used for large purchases - just account for any taxable gains and ensure you have enough for both that and the new expense (car, down payment, etc).","I learned this the hard way and I'm still kicking myself over it.

The reality is that the stock market has always been and remains a money game.

A bet that the published results are accurate, unambiguous, and won't drastically change in the future, that the quality and motivation of the management will remain unchanged over a year, two, or five, etc.  Purchasing growth stocks is, by nature, a gamble.

Okay. Rah rah. But what about the competition? That much money and someone(s) are gonna try and steal a piece and poach your employees.   So this one is for the nays and even the yays like me who want perspective.

It‚Äôs fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn‚Äôt it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause?   &gt; Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.  &gt; over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia‚Äôs margins and the company‚Äôs ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate.   &gt; the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia‚Äôs largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house.   &gt; not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk  &gt; In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia‚Äôs pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth.","As a Nvidia bear at this price, although I‚Äôm holding my long time shares, I believe Nvidia has three main strengths to hold back competition and three weaknesses to its pricing power long term.   1. CUDA (software &amp; support).  2. Best performance even excluding CUDA.  3. First mover advantage (biggest network, most capital).   Weakness I believe are getting bigger although the rate at which they are may not matter in an AI world assuming AI turns out to be the new iPhone or internet.   1. High margins inspire competition (AMD, Intel, Huawei).  2. High exposure to capital rich buyer (vertical alternatives).  3. High risk of shift from LLM training to LLM inference (lowering need for full replacement of prior generation with cutting edge hardware).","This is a good write up.   But the R&amp;D and manufacturing for all this stuff is astronomical.  They say single source as a weakness. They also mentioned that they can tailor any custom chips they make to their own topology and needs. Sounds good.   However, companies outsource non-core components and services all the time. Is Microsoft going to have their own janitorial staff or are they gonna just hire some firm to trim the hedges, wash the windows, and empty the trash?  It was all the rage, many decades ago, to be some perfectly integrated, vertical conglomerate. Like general electric. What is General Electrics core components and products? Hell if I know. Orientation for new hires must take a month.  And companies can get dinged for going on tangents. Amazon was beaten up for a while when they started AWS. Google was punished for their whimsical and very expensive moonshots. Investors like focus, and not to have their money wasted. Hell, they want you to spin off and divisions that straight too far. If you can make it a success, quickly, you‚Äôll be rewarded. But most cases you‚Äôre starting the race in the back.  Auto makers have a plethora, an army, of auto suppliers. Every iPhone is pulling in parts from across the world. It‚Äôs a global economy, and that has helped us tremendously. With admittedly, some hiccups.   But this just seems like such an expensive non-core, non-foundational category to try and compete in. Not to mention your computing with the literal expert at it who might even take it out on you, in a monopolistic fashion.  and the also rans aren‚Äôt gonna have the benefit of scale. If you‚Äôre just making chips for yourself, those are gonna be some expensive chips. Because you still have the same R&amp;D cost, admittedly, lower manufacturing cost cause you don‚Äôt need 1 million warehouses and assembly plants. But your per unit cost is still going to be way higher than nvidia.   Is META going to start making its own ram and hard disks? Build their own brand of jet to shuttle around execs? I think we would shake our heads if we heard they were trying.  It‚Äôs one thing to have Bing search engine. Or competing Mail platforms. But the huge difference in those is this is manufacturing. This is bricks and mortar and a lot, a lot of money. Like if Apple makes a car now. Just one car that would be gigantic undertaking and super expensive. For a non-fundamental manufacturing item where theyd have enormous strategic disadvantages.  *A caveat to all this is maybe I‚Äôm reading this wrong. And AI GPUs **are** core, foundational products for ALL these gigantic, disparate companies. If that is the case, then the AI bubble is just started. It‚Äôs not in its infancy, it‚Äôs not even pregnant yet.*  So this is some bad news for Nvidia, but as I just stated, this is a massive doubling, tripling, quadrupling down on AI. By the biggest most profitable companies on earth.  And that is very good news for nvidia.","""This will affect Nvidia‚Äôs margins and the company‚Äôs ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate.""  These pundits think they know.  Certainly seems logical.   But the truth is the longer Nvidia is left unchallenged the harder it is to displace them.   TPU has been around since 2015, 9 years and Nvidia just get's bigger and more formidable.    They are moving on new businesses, new consumers, new workloads, new discovery every day, so their footprint just gets larger.  ""single source""  yeah, what a shame that never worked out for Intel","I think what we are seeing right now is kind of similar to what happened to the auto industry with EVs.  15 years ago nobody would have said that batteries should be the core competency of a auto maker. But when you build an EV, the battery can make up more than 30 % of the manufacturing cost, basically replacing all the value car makers used to create through the drivetrain. Once you go all in on EVs, you want to at least have a part in the battery production chain because it is such a central part of your product. That's why companies like VW are starting to build their own battery plants, usually in joint ventures.  I would say in the same way, 10 years ago chip manufacturing was not as central to the business of Google/Microsoft/AWS. But once you go all in on AI, spend 20-30 billion every year on one supplier who cashes in a 70%+ margin, it sure does seem pretty central to your business. However the semiconductor manufacturing chain seems a lot more complicated to get into compared to batteries, will be exciting to see how that plays out.","No opinion on Nvidia, but the idea that it saved a sinking market is incorrect. Earnings have beat expectations across the board, this bull run is quite wide (see Russell 2000 up 22% since the bottom), real wages are above inflation (this one makes some people mad for some reason)... Bottom line, this bull market is real, with or without Nvidia. Now, is it helping the narrative, quite possibly.  Even more evidence is all time highs in several international markets, the notorious NIKKEI 225 being one among them.","As someone in the field of DS/ML/AI, I can say that the potential for us to explore on your point 3 is still a lot.   LLMs are still preliminary and there's a lot to improve.   It's not a weakness yet","This guys gf showed him Dicks, now he is all in on Dicks",That seems to be what Apple thinks. They‚Äôve been putting an awful lot of Neural Processing Units in everyone‚Äôs pocket for the last several years with all the Neural Engine cores in their A and M series chips and machine learning APIs. This years WWDC could be interesting.,"You are forgetting that Nvidia is not a chip manufacturer. They are a chip designer. They are 100% reliant on TSMC. All their value cones from their intellectual property, not from any physical or even virtual assets. This makes the whole thing very risky.  TSMC can easily manufacture chips designed by any other company, and they do. All Microsoft, Google and Meta would need to do, is hire engineers and design competing chips, which they are all in fact doing already.",You know which company has made me more gains than Nvidia?  Dick's Sporting Goods.  DKS is growing even faster than NVDA. Don't ask me why.

After garnering huge asset flows in 2020 and 2021 (totaling an estimated $29.2 billion), its funds were decimated in the 2022 bear market, with losses ranging from 34.1% to 67.5% for the year. Many of its funds enjoyed a strong rebound in 2023, but that wasn‚Äôt enough to offset their previous losses. As a result, the ARK family wiped out an estimated $14.3 billion in shareholder value over the 10-year period‚Äîmore than twice as much as the second-worst fund family on the list.

investing,Feb,1atgikx,People who hold a lot of Bitcoin: what is your theory of how it will maintain and grow long-term value?,"I know for most, the crypto craze is pure return-chasing: Bitcoin will go up because it has recently gone up.  But there‚Äôs got be someone around here with an actual theory about why bitcoin will maintain and grow its value over the long run. I assume it has something to do with bitcoin becoming a major medium of exchange (and since supply is capped price will have to rise as people buy in to use it for transactions, like silver in 18th century China). But even if you believe in the blockchain, what makes you confident that Bitcoin specifically will get widespread adoption, when it‚Äôs trivially easy to create new coins?  Obviously I‚Äôm deeply skeptical, but I‚Äôm asking in good faith, I do really want to understand what the theory is here.","I‚Äôve never seen a coherent argument for why me, an average joe, would prefer using BTC over USD as a medium of exchange. But I‚Äôm commenting so I can possibly learn something","I think the potential value comes from having an asset (I use that term loosely) that is perceived to be independent of any government monetary policy. For me, it does not look like it will be adopted as a currency for trade/business and I don't care;  it is more of an an alternative asset (still using the term loosely) used as a store of wealth. Disclaimer: I have 0.6% of my portfolio in Bitcoin (so that's all the conviction I have around my own points).",Try asking the r/Bitcoin subreddit instead of this one about BTC.   This subs commenters are historically bitter about Bitcoin.,It's not about medium of exchange.  When's the last time people use gold bar as medium of exchange?,I lived in Zimbabwe which had hyper inflation and then South Africa which had exchange controls so you couldn‚Äôt purchase foreign currency or get your money out the country.  So when I heard about bitcoin in 2013 I bought it because it is a currency that is outside of government control.   I now live in Canada and this sounded paranoid to some people until our government staring seizing the bank accounts of people that donated to protests against vaccine mandates a couple of years ago.   I bought bitcoin because to me it represents freedom however it has also given me a remarkable ROI  over the last 11 years and so has also become an investment.,"I think the argument as a medium exchange has largely been replaced with store of value. Fixed, finite supply means that over time it mathematically must become more valuable relative to whatever inflating fiat you choose to compare it to. At a minimum, it should holds it's value 1:1, but more likely as adoption grows toward ubiquity (and thereafter, as population grows), value will rise faster than mere inflation.","They won't. Reality is that BTC isn't a currency, it is a collector's item. It will fluctuate, people will trade it, it'll probably go up as long as it holds trust with the crypto community that it can be converted into something else when needed. But inflation is on purpose to encourage spending. If your currency is getting more an more valuable, you tend to want to hold it. Thus BTC is more of a collector's item similar to a gold bar, or jewelry, etc. Just the digital and modern version of such a thing.","His point stands. Had the money been in bitcoin, the threat of freezing or seizure would have been ineffective.",Yep.,"People have decided it's already worth $1T and it's only going to get more scarce. It's pretty obvious it's not a currency but it is property with a limited supply. If gold has a market cap of over $13T I see Bitcoin easily hitting $10T with time.  The only thing that gives fiat value is sentiment. Bitcoin is no different except the Fed/government can't print away the value of Bitcoin at will. If fiat was actually worth anything, Bitcoin wouldn't be an attractive asset. It says more about the value of fiat currency than it does Bitcoin. People are tired of having the value of their labor printed away.  For affect, I'll add that mining Bitcoin does require energy, computing power, and some degree of human time and labor. That does have inherent cost which does add some value beyond sentiment."

investing,Feb,1at0rcx,My wife's 401K rollover- with Empower- is lost in bureaucracy!,"My wife had almost $300,000 in her Empower 401K.  When she lost her job she decided to roll over the funds in her 401K into an individual IRA.  (She could have kept the money in her 401K but had lots of fees and limited investment options.)  She looked into moving the money over to Fidelity where she had an investment account, but got nervous when they told her they (Empower) would mail her a check which she would then have to present to Fidelity. The Internet is full of horror stories of 401K Rollover checks being lost or stolen from the mail.  This happened to two different friends of ours and it took them nearly a month to get it all settled and the money was out of the stock market during a month the market was booming.  So my wife decided to keep the money with Empower and open an Empower IRA so she would simply do a direct 401K to IRA Rollover within the same company.  It was suppose to be easy with no paper check.   So two weeks ago the money was taken out of her 401K account and it now shows zero.  Every day she checks the Empower IRA Account and that shows a ZERO Balance.  The money is lost in computer bureaucracy and not getting any investment returns. The Empower Website says this should only take 2-3 business days!  Every three days she calls the Customer Service Number of Empower and after sitting on hold for 30-60 minutes an unhelpful person answers the phone and tells my wife the transfer (401K to Rollover IRA) **is in process.**  This could happen with any company doing a direct no check 401K to IRA Rollover.  What would you do?  Should we contact an Attorney or work with some government agency to get our money?","For what it‚Äôs worth, I had an Empower Roth 401k and a  Traditional 401k (for the employer match) and I did the same thing a couple years ago. I rolled them into a Roth Brokerage IRA and Traditional IRA after I lost my job. I went through the same thing. Eventually the money did land in my new accounts, but if I recall correctly, it did take a couple weeks.",Empower has electronic rollovers to other firms as well. I‚Äôve done multiple of them as the receiving firm and they‚Äôve always taken 1-2 days. Something is definitely up.,"Sorry to hijack, but this is the most painless way to leave Empower that doesn‚Äôt involve weeks of paper checks:  1. Use their portal based IRA conversion. They will almost certainly put it their ‚ÄúPremiere‚Äù service which only has a handful of fund options. At least you‚Äôll have major index options and your money will only be out of the market for a day.  2. Wait a day or two and call them. Ask to convert your Premier account into a brokerage account. This should be an in-kind transfers that keeps your funds invested.  3. Execute ACAT transfer via new brokerage portal. You have to complete step 2, since their Premier account is not ACAT compatible and will fail.",So if the market went down 3% you were going to cut Empower a check for $9k right?,No need to speculate. They use Pershing.,This should be the top comment.  Empower may use a 3rd party broker like Fidelity.  So your wife's check may actually be going to Fidelity lol,The BBB does not belong in the same category as the CFPB. They are not a regulatory agency nor are they even a government agency. They are the Yelp of an older generation. Don't bother wasting time with them.,The next time she calls and gets a supervisor have her ask for the address she can mail in a written complaint. That‚Äôs might just be enough to do the trick.,BBB isn't a government agency.

COVID gave many an opportunity to downsize their lives, including their homes, and are in pre-retirement mode.  How much of that money sitting is waiting for real estate to cool down, or to lock into fixed income for a steady retirement income stream.  In the 1980's and 1990's people didn't put their retirement money into aggressive stock/bond allocations."
investing,Feb,1b0tdch,Amazon has replaced Walgreens in the Dow Jones Industrial Index.,"[https://apnews.com/article/amazon-walgreens-dow-jones-industrial-average-stock-market-7e7d5e71ee10f7612a45ac1c8bb82c4e](https://apnews.com/article/amazon-walgreens-dow-jones-industrial-average-stock-market-7e7d5e71ee10f7612a45ac1c8bb82c4e)  Supposedly, the motivation was to replace a retail company with another retail company, but everyone knows most of Amazon‚Äòs market value comes from its extremely lucrative web hosting business.  I‚Äòm not sure how I feel about this. Before today, the Dow was the last of the 3 major U.S. large-cap indices with less (relatively speaking) concentration in tech. ‚ÄúBig Tech‚Äù now makes up 30% of the S&amp;P 500 and even more of the NASDAQ-100.  The Dow Jones now includes 3 of the 6 companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon) usually considered as Big Tech, plus cloud software provider Salesforce, as well as 3 legacy tech companies (IBM, Intel, Cisco.) That‚Äòs a lot of exposure to tech.  Relatively few 401k providers offer alternatives such as S&amp;P 500 equally-weighted ETFs.",Difference is Dow is price weighted not market cap weighted so tech has less impact. Also idea was to replace Walgreens with a retail company since wmt split 3-1. Amazon financials may be presently heavily influenced by AWS however good will and brand is more influenced by retail.,"It's going to get increasingly difficult to draw a distinction between industries and ""big tech."" When Waymo begins to make its presence felt in the auto industry, will that make GOOG an auto stock? Or still tech? Amazon was the second biggest retailer in the US, and was the country's second biggest grocery. But it's... Not retail, it's tech?     A lot of industries are going to look more and more like tech companies as time goes on. It would be irresponsible for the Dow to exclude them.",The Dow is like a beta test that someone forgot to end. It is the OG.,Why anyone cares about this index is beyond me,"&gt; A lot of traditional companies are going to look more and more like tech ones (or perhaps vice versa) as time goes on.  The simple truth is that computers are the single greatest invention in the history of mankind and every company, every product, every _thing_ that can be sold in this world can benefit from an appropriate application of digitization.  Is Netflix a tech company or a media company?  Better question--if a new media company sprang up today, how much tech should they incorporate to be innovative and successful? The answer to this shows that there will no longer be any new non-tech comapnies, so the definiton of tech company needs to change.",Being allergic to investing in tech has not helped anyone‚Äôs portfolio in the last 15 years.,the Dow Jones should be so irrelevant by now..,‚Äú2015-16‚Äù &gt;9% drawdown üòπ,What an absolutely ridiculous way to do things.,Who cares?

Prior to this housing was up about 50%, but commercial real estate certainly lagged.",discounted future cash flows.   The REIT you bought when rates were at 1% and paid you 3% was pretty dope.   Well not so dope when rates are 5%.  Value goes down.,"Housing isn't the only part of REITs. In fact for a lot of them it's irrelevant. Commercial real estate is a huge business too, and it's generally down right now",This.   But also because most REIT ETF's are actually mostly non-residential stuff. SO that would not be parallel to the increasing cost of housing.,Commercial real estate values are in the shitter,this is the only true answer. the rest is noise,"Reits don't usually own a lot houses, they own the debt on those houses. Debt yields are up, so debt prices are down.",This is correct. Commercial real estate has really been struggling since the pandemic.,Collapse imminent imo. Everyone is trying to refinance / pile up more debt to cover this year's capital calls. Equinox Holdings is on the hook for +$1.5b and that's just the tip of the iceberg. We'll see a lot of defaults by q2/q3.,Most publicly traded REITs are not residential. Commercial and specifically office REITs have a real problem,Home affordability is at historic levels. Contractors struggle to sell new homes. Commercial RE is a timebomb. This is not a buy low situation
investing,Feb,1az8jex,What are ways you have invested in your home that have yielded the highest annual ROI?,"Here are the big ones for me:  * Replacing our electric resistance hot water heater with a heat pump one. This saved us about $500/year on our electric bill. It cost just under $3,000 after rebates, but less if you also consider a second rebate we got by bundling it with later air-sealing of our home, and a tax rebate. Even without the additional rebates the ROI is 16.7% which is insanely high. * Air-sealing our home. This cost us $1675 after rebates and reduced our heating bill by about $1000 annually leading an absolutely insane ROI of nearly 60%. This not only saved a lot, but it hugely increased comfort; the house is less drafty. The ROI was so high, I'm considering hiring the same company back to further improve on their job in the coming year. I figure even if I get a lower ROI if it's still higher than 8% or so I will keep wanting to spend more. * All energy-efficient lighting. This was one of the first things I installed in the home. Absolute value of savings were probably pretty low (~$150-ish) but the ROI was probably close to 100% because that was about as much as I spent on the lights. * Installing a better showerhead which was both lower-flow but had better ergonomics and features. Improved quality of life but also saved water, which reduced both water and electric bills. My best estimate of savings were about $50 a year, and it only cost $70 so ROI is 71%. Small item and small absolute value of savings but absolutely massive ROI. Thinking of replacing other fixtures such as the kitchen and bathroom sink faucets, considering toilets too, but not sure if these will be favorable because installation costs may make them less favorable in terms of ROI.  The best thing about all of these modifications is that they also increased the value of our home, so they provide an extra increase in equity, which we can benefit from if we sell or refinance, but the ROI was so high it was worth doing even without this.  I think we may have already gotten most of the ""low hanging fruit"" and I doubt I'm going to be able to get as high an ROI going forward, but I am looking to continue to pursue more cost-saving investments.  What were things that worked for you? I'm happy for both big and little things alike.",As far as value is concerned : Kitchen &gt; Bathrooms &gt; Flooring &gt; Exterior features,Are you a husky dog?,What company did you use for air sealing?,"We used Koala, which is a national chain.

Our local one had stellar recommendations, both from Google maps and a neighbor who had had great results from them.",Programmable thermostat.   Turns heating/cooling down when you aren't home. Returns to normal temps just before you arrive home.   I turn the heat way down at night. I prefer the house at fifty or below. My bed is very warm and I sleep better. ¬† Save a bundle on gas and electric.,Its not an instant roi unless you sell the house instantly.,"Landscaping. Even just having it mowed and amateurly taken care of looks a million times better than letting it grow naturally (for most people)  If you can get some weeds out, even better.","If you have a contractor brother and get a new kitchen for $5000 but it adds $25000 to your value, that's a solid and instant ROI. But I think you mean ways to save on bills? Proper Insulation is a huge one.","Not sure if that's always a good idea. It depends a lot on the interest rate and your risk tolerance, but unless the rate is very high, you usually come out way ahead keeping more of your money in investments that yield more than the mortgage rate, and paying off the mortgage off as slow as possible.","For reals, I like sleeping cool but fifty or below is some shit. Honestly I'd feel bad for the person because unless they live in North Pole, half the year wouldn't even possibly reach their ""ideal sleeping temperature"" or they are blasting AC.   65-70F should be the ideal sleep zone for mass majority of people, but oh wells, whatever works works"

Similar with VRTX, they have also gained 36% over the last year.  For Peloton its the opposite - it has been beaten down to 28% of its value from a year ago - any news slightly more positive than what investors are expecting will pull it back up.

Not just into nice offices, but to go from bookstore, to ebook readers, to selling everything, to AWS, to grocery stores (which are actually pretty cool and price competitive at least here in Seattle), healthcare, etc. It was a slow grind, but it has paid off and it certainly didn't keep Amazons stock from exploding, several times over the decades.

It aims to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.   The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering (IPO) price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors.   The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at about $10 billion in a funding round in 2021, did not immediately respnd to Reuters request for comment.   Reuters in January reported that Reddit has drawn up detailed plans for its IPO in March. It had filed confidentially for its IPO back in December 2021.   The IPO market has not yet fully recovered as it has been struggling for the last two years with low volumes while several new entrants trade below their IPO prices.

Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one.  I'm a member of the Triple Nine Society, but I'm not smarter than all of them.  If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.    I prefer mutual funds, but ETFs could also work well.  The differences are usually trivial for a long-term investor, especially if they're the Vanguard funds I mentioned above.  Actually, the Vanguard funds I mentioned above have both traditional mutual fund shares &amp; ETF shares; they both represent a piece of the same fund.    The funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds; these are excellent choices for many investors.  Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically.  Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors.    Other companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because they've been the leader in this type of investing for decades &amp; because Vanguard's customers are also Vanguard's owners.    I hope that helps!  I'd be happy to help w/ further questions. Best wishes!","There‚Äôs zero mathematical reason to invest in bond‚Äôs at OPs age.

I feel like $180 doesn‚Äôt seem a lot at the end of the year, but it kind of does.","It would be worth it, but if you don‚Äôt have an emergency fund already in place it can make you worse off if life happens.  Stocks go up and down, and in the long run they go up. If you‚Äôre forced to dip into the invested money there‚Äôs a fairly high chance you‚Äôll have to sell at a loss (until you‚Äôve been able to let it ride for years and years)  Having savings gives you the breathing room for your investments to remain untouched when an emergency happens.  What‚Äôs your profession? It seems really apparent that time you spend learning skills that make you earn more in the first place are going to be worth 10,000x finding the optimal way to invest $180/year","Make it $25, make them automatic and don‚Äôt stop after a year. You‚Äôre right, this is not a meaningful amount but you can grow the deposit amount as your financial situation improves over time.  Is it worth it? Yes!

If not, put that money into a HYSA instead.","I‚Äôm going to disagree with most people here and say it‚Äôs not worth it. Practice the good savings habit by putting that extra money in to a savings account (high yield savings accounts are even returning 4-4.5% these days risk free). Investments go up and down, and despite the recent euphoria in the market, there are no guarantees. If you only have $15-25/mo of savings ability, your financial situation is too precarious to be risking any of it. And it‚Äôs certainly not worth stressing over the investment gains and losses.    If/when you get in a better financial situation, you will more than eclipse the missed gains. $25/month for a year is $200. At 10%/year growth, you‚Äôre missing about $20/year in gains. Even if it takes several years, once you‚Äôre in a better financial you‚Äôll be able to make that difference up in a couple months.","&gt;Stocks go up and down, and in the long run they go up.  In the long run the stock market goes up, individual stocks don't necessarily go up.

And the market in China has even less to do with their economy. There are fundamental differences between the US and Chinese economies. For example, Chinese citizens save way more, credit cards are much less of a thing, real estate and gold are hugely culturally important and play a bigger role, etc, etc. You cannot make direct comparisons between how things work in the US and China.

investing,Feb,1ar1g1k,Best lithium stocks to buy for long term holding?,I‚Äôm long term bullish on lithium for a number of reasons 1) Market growth over the next 5-10 years 2) Irreplaceable as a foundational commodity for the green energy transition 3) Major consolidation will continue to happen leading to more / better upstream growth opportunities.   Is anyone else holding ETFs or stocks? What are your lithium plays for 2024?,"I'd be cautious leaning too far into this thesis: lithium is not rare. The very cheapest to mine lithium deposits are maxed out in the Atacama but there is plenty hard rock based lithium around the globe. The price ceiling is going to continue to fall as attention gets paid to floating it out of hard rock more efficiently. That's to say nothing of alternative battery technologies.  Beyond that, the mining and process industry has been watching this trend forever - the thesis you laid out is 20 years old. There is really no new news here.  I'd just caution going too far in on this one.","I'm all in on Albemarle (ALB). I'll watch LAC for fun, but it isn't sla long term play. ALB has a huge history of being profitable in any market conditions and sustaining a dividend. It holds some of the best areas for lithium harvesting that it's set in stone until 2040.    I don't really see any other competitors that I feel confident will be doing well in 10 to 15 years. Obviously there is more explosive growth potential in something like LAC, but I think it will be a class in the plan as bigger players are able to weather these period price crashes. The P/E ratio and dividend alone makes ALB attractive, even though I know P/E has a somewhat odd pattern for commodities producers and miners.   If minimum lithium is looking to be unprofitable long term, ALB has the resources and cash flow to pivot into a more profitable commodity. Few other companies can do that, especially not without taking on mountains of high interest debt.",Wait till you find out about the alternatives to lithium batteries ü§£,"New battery technologies have been ""just around the corner"" for at least 20 years. I'll believe it when I see it.","This isn't terrible advice, but it seems too generalized for a post specifically asking about lithium stocks.  Why do you feel the need to copy and paste such generalities?","They're not going to replace them in 10 years, which is OP's scale.  Think about how long it too to get lithium ion batteries to where they are.  Flow cell has potential.  Gravity batteries take tons of land and water, so they're useful situational.    Lithium isn't oil, but it's not going away lol.",$ALB,"Correct - it's really important to understand the supply side if you are making commodity investments. Way too many people on Reddit only look at demand. I might be wrong, but lithium simply doesn't look very attractive from a supply side POV. The barriers to entry are not high at all, and there's shit loads of it.",Post: What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?  Comment: Ice cream isn't healthy. I eat a balanced diet and only eat a little dessert every once in a while.,"Down compared to what?  It's back to the realistic prices from 2020.  It got pandemic supply chained and shot through the rough, so the pendulum swung back.  There's an 12-18 month delay in turning up production from brine based lithium.  They can pump more water out the ground immediately but it takes that long to turn it into carbonate.   Demand increased, but there was only so much lithium in the pipeline+pandemic.  Suppliers turned on faucet, supply go up, price go down."
investing,Feb,1am6y4k,What's the point of Income Limit on Roth IRA Contributions?,"When it takes literally 2 more minutes to just do a backdoor Roth ira contribution once you exceed the income limit?  This ""loophole"" has been around for so long now that everyone knows about it and does it...if anything it makes the Roth IRA contributors suffer once they're near the income limit and have to stress about being penalized for overcontributing.","I mean, there's simply no will to remove the loophole. Very few people feel bad that someone making fix figures has some extra complications with tax advantaged accounts and the IRS is getting their money either way.","If your income is over a certain level, you are not allowed to contribute directly to a Roth IRA. You are, however, allowed to contribute to a Traditional IRA (at that income level you can't take the tax deduction for it). You are also allowed to convert money from a trad IRA to a Roth IRA anytime - you just have to pay income tax on the money converted (which, if you aren't taking the tax deduction for the trad IRA contribution, is nothing for the money contributed).  Hence, the way around the law is to contribute your money to a trad IRA and immediately convert it to Roth. This is called a ""backdoor Roth"".  There are complication with this approach, such as the pro-rata rule, but we'll leave that for another time.","Typically, if you have money in a traditional IRA, it is pre-tax money you haven't paid tax on yet. When you convert money from a trad IRA to a Roth IRA, you have to pay the income you owe on it to make it post-tax money (because that's what a Roth is). When you do a backdoor Roth, you're putting post-tax money into the trad IRA and converting it over, so you don't owe income tax on it during the conversion because you've already paid it.  BUT, if you have other pre-tax money in your trad IRA, you can't just convert over the post-tax contribution you just made. As far as the IRS is concerned, all the money in there is intermixed, so when you make the conversion you have to pay tax on the proportion of the money that is pre-tax.   For example, let's say you have $21,000 of pre-tax money in your trad IRA and make the max contribution of $7000 to it with with post-tax money with the intention of converting it to Roth as a backdoor. You can't just convert the $7000 to Roth and say it was all post-tax money. You really now have $28,000 in your trad IRA account, where 25% is post-tax and rest is pre-tax. When you convert $7000 over to Roth, 75% of it pre-tax money, so you will need to pay income tax on $5250 of it to make the conversion.  That's the pro-rata rule.","I would say there‚Äôs *some* will to fix it, given closing the loophole has been raised in various draft bills, but it‚Äôs a very easy thing to ‚Äúgive up‚Äù or drop in reconciliation. It‚Äôs just not a big enough loophole for anyone to score political points on and die on that hill.","It's such a small yearly amount I don't know why the limit even exists... with the exception that I think any tax advantaged account (traditional, roth, whatever) should *not* be allowed to invest in any non-public investment... it is the answer to the Peter Thiel and Mitt Romney chicanery.",Can someone ELI5 the loop hole mentioned here?,"It's not really a double tax. You're only paying tax on the proportion that hasn't been taxed yet, which you were going to have to do someday. It's just that you probably weren't planning on doing that until you started taking distributions from your traditional IRA in retirement. You also probably don't have money withheld for it at tax time, so it can be painful and defeats the purpose of what you were trying to do.  If you have money in a traditional IRA and you have a 401k that allows you to roll an IRA into it, the easiest thing to do is roll your trad IRA into the 401k. 401ks aren't subject to the pro-rata rule.",Or the TL;DR version: don't do a backdoor Roth if you had pre-tax money in a Traditional IRA as of December 31 of the prior year.,Tax revenue now instead of 30 years from now.,What is the pro-rata rule?

And you wonder how many ppl on this forum own those underlying stocks in the exact same weight as each other. Which is a weird concept when you think about it.   From MarketWatch interview:  &gt; Value is just not a consideration for most investment money that‚Äôs out there. There‚Äôs all the machine money and algorithmic money which doesn‚Äôt have an opinion about value it has an opinion about price: ‚ÄòWhat is the price going to be in 15 minutes and I want to be ahead of that,'‚Äù he explained.  &gt; As money moves from active management to passive, value managers are forced to deal with redemptions. They then sell their holdings, which causes value stocks to fall further, triggering more redemptions. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden the people who are performing are the people who own the overvalued things that are getting the flows from the indexes. You take the money out of value and put it in the index, they‚Äôre selling cheap stuff and they‚Äôre buying whatever the highest multiple, most overvalued things are in disproportionate weight,‚Äù  &gt; now means that you no longer have to pay 10 times earnings to profit An investor can now find the same scenario at four or five times earnings.

investing,Feb,1ani22c,Do rent prices go up faster than SP500?,"We all know rent rises faster than wages, but what about SP500?  One of the big cons with renting vs housing is rent prices will always go up while a 30 year fixed stays the same.  But if SP500 goes up faster than rent, and someone does not want to buy a house, wouldn't it just be good to hold SP500 and withdraw yearly to pay for a years worth of rent?  Ex. 24 years old and life expectancy is 75 = \~50 years left, which is about 600 month. 600 months of rent at 2000/mo = $1,200,000 in a lifetime.  If I had 1.2 million in SP500 RIGHT NOW (hypothetically) (and along with other assets), wouldn't it just be alright to rent forever and withdraw from the 1.2 million gradually over time to pay for the rent?  Or is buying a house ALWAYS the way?","You are oversimplifying the comparison. Rent has no leverage.  Rent had no tax advantages. Rent builds no equity. Rent increases vary wildly city to city, state to state. Etc.","Owning has no tax advantage for most people anymore because the standard deduction is so high ($29,000 in 2024 for married filing jointly).

Would it be more beneficial to pay off the mortgage as fast as I can, or spend the extra money investing in index funds, since apparently they are 8-10% return per year?","A mortgage is a reverse bond.  You are the bond issuer and the mortgage company is the bond holder.  So ask yourself, if you could buy a bond that paid 6.5% per year for x years, would you buy it?  Well, the market rate right now on long term bonds is 4.x% -- so of course you would.  But in this case you are the issuer -- so would you sell a bond for 6.5%?  Not if you could help it!  So to me, the most logical way to decide whether to pay it off is to compare your rate to treasuries of a similar maturity date.  If your rate is higher, I would work on paying it down.","Nobody knows.¬†  Plenty of people would be satisfied with a guaranteed 6.5%, which is what you get paying the mortgage.¬†  An index fund could return 25% or -25%.",I can stop reading now.

Not if you could help it!  Yeah, not so fast. The non-dumb answer to this question is *""sure you would, if you can get a higher yield elsewhere for the same level of risk.""*  Some other useful facts:   * the historical average return of the stock market is higher than 6.5%. * you can get a tax deduction for mortgage interest * you won't lower your monthly payment by pre-paying (unless you re-cast, which generally costs money).  When you pre-pay a mortgage, what you're doing is putting money into principal on the asset itself [1], and cutting payments off the back-end of the loan (which could be 30 years from now!) So the real question is: would you rather invest *present-day money* in your home for a return in N years, or in something else? Because unless you re-cast on a regular basis (again: $), you're only getting that money back when you sell, when you pay down the loan, or (possibly) when you re-finance. If you're like most people, you're not saving any interest for a long, long time (possibly never, if you sell soon enough in the amortization curve).  Nobody can answer this question but you, but OP's argument is misleading. You have to do the math, and make your own assumptions about risk and yield.  [1] **Highly important thing to know:** if you do decide to pre-pay your mortgage, you must make sure your servicer isn't simply allocating the extra payments in advance. You will gain nothing if you do this -- it's like paying a year of rent in advance. You must tell them that you want all extra payments to go to principal.","We need a whole financial snapshot here to make a good decision.  For example, do you have an emergency fund?

You might be refinancing in a couple years anyway.  Are the payments too high, do you write off of the mortgage interest, do you plan on retiring in sooner than 30 years?    Velow is a flowchart, I don't recall if mortgage is on there, but I would probably max my tax advantaged retirement accounts before making extra payments.

Compare this to Facebook‚Äôs ARPU in US/Canada of $68.44.   \- 98% of revenue is from their ads (they have some freemium features but they never really made an impact) but the big question mark is can they monetize the API side and license their data to LLMs. Reddit‚Äôs $60m Google licensing deal right on the eve of this S1 is likely to build confidence there, but licensing still feels like the big unknown when it comes to monetization.   \- Reddit gets a massive portion of revenue from just a few top advertisers.

investing,Feb,1aqnmpd,Nvidia - cash out profits and buy an ETF or hold?,"Nvidia releases earnings on 2/21. There doesn't seem to be a consensus what the stock will do, especially given the fact that the price doesn't really seem to be tied to traditional valuations. I currently have over 300 shares, mostly long-term with a gain of almost 700%. I'm 52 and looking to retire in about 8 years, with an overall net worth (including house) of over $2.5M. Most of my net worth is in a 400k, but I have a non-significant amount tied up in stocks, with Nvidia now representing over 30% of my total stock holdings (not including 401k).     I've been considering cashing out a chunk of Nvidia and just putting it in an ETF like VOO to insulate me a bit from any potential massive down-tick in the stock. Unfortunately, most of the ETFs are also heavily invested in the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks, which includes Nvidia. I've also been trying to figure out what a good ""break-even"" type point would be, if I cashed out and took a 20% capital gains hit (federal + state) and how much the stock would need to drop for me to buy back in at a more reasonable price. I'm clearly a bit all over the map here and would appreciate some feedback and guidance.","NVDA is a great company and a stock I plan to hold forever.  However, if I had 300 shares I would likely be selling some into this mania, and certainly prior to earnings. Having 30% of your holdings in a single stock, even the market leader, is a big risk.  Since your gain is 700% you can sell half and still be way ahead. That would be my plan. If the stock surges to 1000 on earnings you're still holding a big chunk.","No one ever lost money taking profits.   Nvidia is doing incredibly well right now, but expectations are also sky high. That is a risk for their current momentum, they don't just have to do well but do extremely well to meet expectations. At some point they will fall short of that. It is inevitable.  Anyone who denies that is delusional btw. It happens to every company, Nvidia will be no different   Will this earnings report be that moment? I have no idea.  Holding Nvidia is a high risk high reward move. Index fund ETFs is a safe move. Up to you what you want to do.  But again: no one ever lost money taking profits.","Pretty much this, with that many shares at that level of gain I would be taking around half my position and sell before earnings. Then reinvest it in an ETF. If you go with an ETF like VOO that money you reinvest will still have some exposure to NVDA while being diversified. Especially at 52 with ~8 years till retirement, mitigating risk is a smart move.   I on the other hand have 8 shares of NVDA, while at a similar 700% gain, I'm going to hold onto those shares for the next decade and see where it goes. I'm also 32 and have a lot of years to go until retirement.",I sold 420 shares a few weeks ago and like yourself I had massive gains  My thought is I don‚Äôt want to get to greedy and I was thrilled with my investment which was in a Roth so I did not pay taxes  I moved all of it to VUG‚Ä¶.

The interest goes back into my 401k over the 5 year term of the loan. The only negative I can see is the opportunity cost of the cash that will securitize the loan sitting in cash and not invested‚Äîbut that opportunity cost would just be the delta between the 9.5% interest I‚Äôm paying back to myself vs whatever return I would get from investing that money into a stock or ETF or whatever. Am I missing something here? It seems like a good option vs using money from my taxable account/pulling from my savings.,Almost every comment I see here is terrible advice and/or flat out incorrect. Check with your 401(k) provider and your CPA to be sure of anything before you move forward.,"You have to pay them loan back with after tax money. So if you pay a 25% effective rate - 9.5% interest going back into the 401k = 15.5% ""fee"" for the loan. Plus that money is also removed from the market. You'd be investing in property so in theory that'll gain value that cash is out of the market until you pay it back.","If you google ""401k loan taxed twice"" there are about a billion places saying this is wrong.  &gt; You have to pay the loan back with after tax money.  Either you pay income tax on money you then use as downpayment for home.  Or you use 401k loan as downpayment for home and then pay income tax on money you use to repay loan.","I did that to buy my first house and was 1 of my best financial decisions.

I'm gonna have a stroke reading this comment thread I swear,The only bad part I see is if you leave your job or get fired the loan is due in full.

Bank interest goes, well, to the bank.","This is a common misconception. There's no double-taxation on the principal portion of the loan.  Because you aren't taxed when you receive the loan, think of it like a temporary pre-tax-to-post-tax-without-paying-tax conversion. Paying it back is just the reverse.  Or, to make it simpler, imagine taking a 401k loan and then immediately paying it all back the next day. You wouldn't expect that to have any major tax consequences, good or bad, right? Why would it make a difference if you do it slower?  You *are* double-taxed on the interest you pay in, though. That's a point against them.  The bigger reason not to take a 401k loan is that if you can't pay it back you're doubly boned, because you'll take a huge tax hit on top of losing retirement money."

I‚Äôm in the middle of buying a new home at 600,000. With the interest rates at 7% do I buy the house outright or do I still get a loan? At what interest rate would you chose the loan over paying off the house? The rest of the cash I was planning on putting into the S&amp;P 500 or VTI. Thanks",At 7% I would purchase outright,"Buy outright,  less long term stress about performing better than 7% after taxes. Invest the $700k leftover and feel good.",The cash flow of a paid off house is something so many people sleep on too.,"Around 84%-87% of the payment would go towards paying interest in the first couple years (assuming 7% on 30 year note). If they borrow 80% of the $600k purchase that‚Äôs about $66,000 spent on interest in the first two years.","Here's a different way to phrase your question:  Would you borrow cash at 7% with 20% collateral held in escrow to invest in the market right now? Because that's basically what you're doing by taking a mortgage in order to put more cash in the S&amp;P.  I say this as someone who recently made the same decision - in the last 6 months. Bought a second home, could have gotten a mortgage at 6.X%, or could have paid cash.   Paid the cash, and don't regret it at all.",[removed],Any merit to taking the 7% mortgage now and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in a couple years?,"Financially speaking you are probably at a wash for now.   I like the loan for flexibility purposes with liquidity. Plus if you aren‚Äôt married or are itemizing you‚Äôre seeing a fairly significant tax deduction from interest, significantly lowering your real interest rate (33k in interest the first year).  Investment will statistically have about the same return as cost in the first few years because of this and do better if you refinance down. Plus it gives you flexibility. That said, there is peace of mind to not having the debt which you should consider.  Plus in the future you are likely to refinance as rates are expected to fall to around 5% in the next couple years. Refinancing will generally get a lower rate than a cash out refinance as well.  To your what % question Personally under 8% I‚Äôd probably take the loan, especially given interest rate and inflation outlook currently. But I‚Äôm aggressive and understand the risk and I‚Äôm ok with it. 7% is probably the bubble and it depends on future rate outlook. 6% I‚Äôd take the loan and definitely under 5%  Hope this helps and best of luck","Keep in mind that inflation isn't a possibility it's a guarantee. So if you buy a house outright you are buying with dollars that are worth significantly more than they will be in 10, 20, or 30 years.   However the point may be moot if your interest rates are high.   Personally I'd probably put down 20% to avoid PMI then invest the rest while making payments. I understand wanting to pay one big lump sum and be done with it though.","I think most people get in the habit of over-leveraging themselves and forget, or never really knew, what that sort of monthly cash flow feels like.

investing,Feb,1b18zxx,"Citi's research, outlining their view that S&amp;P 500 is not in a bubble.","Overall, the year-to-date surge of nearly 7% in the S&amp;P 500 increases the necessity for fundamental growth factors to materialize and sustain the market's movement, Citi added. Essentially, investors are advancing funds based on anticipated future earnings growth. We remain confident in this, but need to recognize that much has quickly been priced in. While the index may overshoot our year-end 5100 target in the short term, it seems premature to increase the probability of our 5700 bull case scenario, strategists led by Scott T. Chronert said.     That scenario reflects a goldilocks macro and 22x a $260 index earnings projection (vs our base case $245 estimate). For now, we remain constructive on SP 500 fundamentals, but prefer to buy pullbacks, they added. Citi also responded to recent parallels drawn between the current bull market and the tech bubble, pointing out that today's valuation multiples are significantly lower than those seen in 1999-2000.     From their perspective, the strategists think that the underlying fundamentals of the market have markedly changed, distinguishing the current situation from that of the late '90s. That said, the current spending ramp on gen AI infrastructure and product will need to translate to incremental revenue and growth drivers. But it is premature to judge that, Chronert and his team commented.     Moreover, Citi previously said that market broadening is crucial for reaching new index peaks. While it's true that a handful of mega-cap companies have significantly propelled the S&amp;P 500 to new highs, contributing to about half of the index's gains, there's also been a significant rise in the number of stocks reaching 52-week highs, Citi highlighted.",Any time an investment bank tells me it‚Äôs not a bubble I have to wonder if they‚Äôre trying to convince me to buy what they are selling as they exit their long positions.  They‚Äôve done it before.,Bubble confirmed.,Not sure if Citi is an expert in identifying bubbles if it barely survived the 2008 sub-prime mortgage bubble.,Good thing that'll never happen so this thought experiment is pointless,"A couple quick notes, first, this isn‚Äôt Citi‚Äôs IB talking. It‚Äôs Citi‚Äôs buy-side ‚Äî see ‚Äústrategists‚Äù. They have a strict fire wall between the buy &amp; sell-side, and even if it wasn‚Äôt perfectly airtight, it‚Äôs a macro opinion, which an IB has no ‚Äúinside‚Äù information on. Also, because IBs are on the sell-side, they don‚Äôt hold ‚Äúlong positions‚Äù, in the same way you are implying, they underwrite/raise capital through transactions like IPOs and M&amp;A events and then move onto the next, with virtually no residual longterm ownership. Furthermore, because this report is from their buy-side, they only benefit if you buy and hold their funds into perpetuity (it‚Äôs how they make money). So they are incentivized to sell you their funds, not underlying shares. If they wanted to ‚Äúexit‚Äù positions in their funds, they would quickly have to put their cash back to work or else face backlash from clients (who pay for certain exposures) or regulatory bodies (due to very likely changing the funds mandate).  Long story short, this isn‚Äôt nefarious, like any business they obviously want to make money, but they‚Äôll make a lot more if their forecasts, like these, are right and you buy their funds (not long positions in some exit strategy).",is it really surviving when you were bailed out by the government?,The mechanism is they will have spent all this money into it with nothing to show for it.,"This statement is key to me:  &gt; the current spending ramp on gen AI infrastructure and product will need to translate to incremental revenue and growth drivers  The big guys spending billions on NVDA GPU's and related LLM's for AI MUST see returns in hard monetary terms on those investments.

It‚Äôll be interesting to see how all these investments in AI contribute to the bottom line for the mega caps, should start showing up in 3-4Q roughly?

investing,Feb,1b0t1pn,EV stocks. How are you navigating the current bloodbath?,"My EV portfolio is looking dire gents - more holes than the US-Mexico border.  The EV landscape has gone from great to shitshow in the last 6 months as the entire supply chain (from automakers to mines) is struggling due to lackluster EV sales.  Likely, the EV boom will become a hybrid boom as predicted by Toyota. I think lithium as a commodity will struggle for a few more months but will eventually find a stale floor price.  My long term bet is that upstream lithium (mines, refineries,) will continue to consolidate at a rapid rate and the lithium supply chain will tighten as a result. SQM and Albemarle are having a field day right now picking up strategic acquisitions for pennies on the dollar (I'm accumulating both).  What are you betting on EV stocks wise?","OT, but how much do you want to bet this same exact type of post with ""AI"" in the title gets posted in 2-3 years?",I avoided it by not investing in car companies.  It's a shit industry with poor margins and massive costs.,"The issue is hybrids can't get better.  EV's can. We're still in the early stages of EV innovation. Think about it from this perspective: Five years ago, would you have ever considered an EV? Hell no. These days, it's more popular than ever.   Hybrids are good vehicles but the fact is, many who drive hybrids do not rely on electricity and more on gasoline to refuel the vehicle. The efficiency is great but it's not cleaner than an EV nor is it capable of the same performance (speed).  China doesn't have an EV demand issue. It's practically their best seller.  Europe doesn't really have an EV demand issue, either. Their adoption rate is very high with some countries, like Norway, pushing only EV sales.  The problem with U.S. is we have easy access to gasoline and a lack of EV infrastructure. In California, there's widespread EV adoption. In NYC, EV's aren't as popular because anyone who lives in an apartment and owns a car doesn't have a readily available area to charge. In China, this is VERY different. Charging is very accessible in most metro areas.  Rivian and LUCID suffer from the same issue: Two startup EV companies that have great products but can't produce them at a gross profit. When your labor/materials costs more than the price you're selling the vehicles for, then there's a problem. Tesla never had that issue.   Ford/GM have a separate issue in the sense that they can't make EV's cheaper because they're afraid that by producing too many EV's, they're losing ICE profits. For every EV Ford/GM sell, they are most likely taking away an ICE sale. Let's say they make $20k profit from an ICE vehicle and lose $40k from an EV sale. That's a $60k loss. They're not willing to take that hit.  Tesla is the only U.S. automaker capable of sustainably generating a profit selling EV's. No one comes close. And that's something that these other automakers are and will continue having issues with for the foreseeable future.",There is a bloodbath?,Funny how looking back how these analysts tried to justify the valuation for these EV companies and how they were so much more than traditional ICE manufacturers..,"&gt; Likely, the EV boom will become a hybrid boom as predicted by Toyota. I think lithium as a commodity will struggle for a few more months but will eventually find a stale floor price.   Let me get this right. A year with doubling in EV sales is somehow an indication that hybrids are the future?   No, that's not the issue here. The issue is that many legacy and new automakers went all-in on super luxury high-priced EV trucks and SUVs. The prices made Tesla's look like a good deal.   Speaking of Tesla, as much as I hate some of their business practices and quality control, they're the only automaker that is able to actually make battery packs at scale. That's because they made the investment 10 years ago that legacy automakers are making now.   And finally, EV stocks, including Tesla, were way overpriced anyway. The same way AI stocks are probably overpriced right now. But we won't find out for another couple years probably.","To me, I wouldn't consider the AI bubble to be like the EV bubble we've seen (BTW, Tesla is definitely the winner in that space), rather, I would compare it to the 2000 tech bubble in this specific regard...Yes, back in 2000 the hype for internet, internet related, e-commerce, [dot.com](https://dot.com) was at a boiling level WITH virtually ZERO companies even near the realm of profitable (amazon was at the forefront of this hype back then) and, when the music stopped, everyone got drilled. Where am I going with this? Well, nearly 24 years later, that tech bubble paved the way for the technological revolution that we currently are living in today.   To bring the point full circle, it is likely that the true realization AND, heavy monetization of the AI movement, is years away from being even moderately realized and, the difference in this case, as is well documented, is that the companies at the forefront are printing money, hand over first, with their current business models. So, if we do get the pullback on the AI hype, via overhype, I recommend everyone buy the highest quality names as, when we get into the 4th, 5th, 6th innings, they will be at the forefront of the next technological wave, AI, and we will look back at these moments and realize it was at its very infancy!",Tesla split in August 2022.,Buying index funds,"Disclosure: I don't own, nor have I ever owned, Tesla. That being said, to me, outside of a Chinese company, I don't see who is going to capture the market quite like Tesla has. Ford (Who has a boatload of Ford Lightning's sitting on lots), GM and others, seemingly, have pulled back their electric ambitions and, Rivian for example, speaks for itself (I believe I saw today that they lose $43,000.00 per car they sell?)

investing,Feb,1aj2rf2,Roast me: I‚Äôm a financial advisor who charges AUM,"I‚Äôm a financial advisor with about 15 years of experience under my belt, and so much of the feedback I see on Reddit is so negative toward advisors that pay AUM, so I thought I‚Äôd ask for your feedback  I charge based on AUM, but very little of what I do is related to investment management. I run my practice like a family office with the following services on an unlimited basis: 1. Investment management (largely passive, sophisticated hands on management including tax loss harvesting, building out individual bond ladders, providing access to alternative investment opportunities like late stage venture capital, real estate, and private equity).  2. Cash flow planning - helping clients envision how much money they‚Äôd need to make a significant purchase (new home, relocation, etc), or to retire.  3. Legal/estate planning - I not only provide initial suggestions for estate planning, I refer my clients to an attorney specifically selected from my network and I also sit in on every call they have with the attorney throughout the estate planning process. I act as the coordinator for every project and am with clients each step of the way.  4. Tax advisory- my firm provides in house tax advice, and I have connections with CPAs, corporate tax planners, and tax attorneys. If a client is in need of any of these professionals, I also sit in on each of these calls to ensure I can manage a clients project properly. 5. Balance sheet management - I only get paid for my AUM, but I also advise on items that I can‚Äôt manage. I will provide input outside investment opportunities clients get from their personal networks or other investment institutions. I discuss writing individual checks to startup companies, and participate in conversations about cryptocurrency investments.   I feel like I do a lot for my AUM fee, which starts at 0.65% and declines to 0.4% at $10M. However, it doesn‚Äôt seem like the world thinks very highly of what I do for a living.   So Reddit, roast me. Tell me why you don‚Äôt need me.",If you didn‚Äôt need any of the other services and only care about growing a taxable brokerage account would you hire you?,"It sounds like you offer a lot of value for your clients. And given your account minimum, you‚Äôre not preying on someone who can‚Äôt really afford it.  Most of the hate in this sub for AUM fees seems to be targeted towards advisors charging entry-level investors - someone with $50k to invest getting charged 1% to essentially just invest in index funds. You‚Äôre obviously doing a lot more for the people who actually need it.","Paying for advice gets a bad wrap.   I think a lot of reddit skews younger, still just saving and buying each month. In reality, besides a little advice on optimizing where to stash your money, there just isn't as much advice to give. Most people can figure all of that out on their own, at least 97% of it. And since younger people are more likely focused on maxing IRA/401(k) and then taxable second, tax-loss harvesting isn't as important, and is pretty simple.

We broke the billion dollar mark in revenue but it landed short of the expectations and our guidance for Q1 wasn‚Äôt as high as market expectations.  Stock dropped 15% today.  Our executive chairman sold a combined 80k shares reportedly on Feb 2nd and Feb 5th. Totals around 3.2 million I believe.

investing,Feb,1aweeqt,"If the best strategy to make money is to buy and hold an index fund, who is keeping the market ‚Äúefficient‚Äù?","I always hear that actively managed funds (and individuals) fail to beat indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. If this is the case, how does the market stay efficient when instead of needing to research companies based on their fundamentals, capital just flows into the top 500 companies with no regard to whether or not they are actually good companies?  It seems to me like the following two things cannot be true at the same time:  1. The market will efficiently price individual companies based on their ability to gain value.  2. The best way for capital to gain value is to buy and hold an index that reflects the market and is agnostic to individual companies.   Eventually, if point #2 holds true, actively managed funds will become weaker and weaker, until everybody is just pouring money into market indexes.   If point #1 holds true, then it seems like the entire modern investing paradigm of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt beat the market‚Äù is wrong. Perhaps actively managed funds will beat the market in the VERY long run, even if most of them have failed to do so in the last couple decades.","&gt; ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt beat the market‚Äù  You're assuming ""you"" in the universal sense. _You_ can't beat the market. You don't have the resources nor do you have the access to beat the market.   An index fund is a bet on the entire market. An actively managed mutual is a bet on a manager. There's also hedge funds and individuals and PE firms and companies like Berkshire and etc. etc.",Just want to clarify that the SP500 is not the 500 largest companies. To be included into it has some quality criteria.,Thank you for sharing your feelings with everyone.,"A lot of the actively-managed funds included in that statistic are not intended to beat the S&amp;P, that's not one of their objectives.  Many of them are instead designed to not *lose* their clients money.  To be more resistant in downturns.  Many super rich people are more concerned about not losing their money than they are growing it in multiples.",I think a more accurate description is being ok accepting that no one gets first place often enough to beat regularly getting 3rd place.   Think of it like a season of NASCAR - you can end the season in first place never having won any particular race. And if anyone could just get 3d every race they would probably win the season no matter how hot the person with the most 1st place wins was.,"On this note it is worth mentioning the famous Buffet open offer bet.  The bet was that Buffet would put his money in the S&amp;P and the hedge fund could put their money anywhere, and after 10 years the loser donates $1M to the winner's charity of choice.  Only one hedge fund came forward, Ted Seides of Protege Partners, and they made the bet.  Buffet won, with the S&amp;P beating Protege's returns.  It is a champion flag waived by proponents of passive investing.  But the takeaway is wrong.  Buffet's exception and problem with hedge funds wasn't even their ability to generate returns.  It was specifically the 2 and 20 fee structure.  That means a 2% expense fee and 20% of all profits are paid to the management team.  Truly ridiculous.  Seides admitted almost instantly that he didn't expect his funds to beat the S&amp;P, and that having the kind of access to Buffet that the bet gave him for 10 years was far more valuable than the charity donation, which was a write-off anyways.  This comment is not putting an agenda on either side of the coin, but just explaining why people misinterpret this statistic/saying and the Buffet bet.","&gt; VTI are bets on whole market  Only the USA equity market. When people say beat the market (what I admit I will say too) usually they are talking about some popular index like the S&amp;P500  but that is not the only market, there is mid caps, small caps, Total market, international markets, world market  And that is just for equities, there are also credit markets and remember the credit market is something like 25x the size of the equity market","A lot of that ""nobody beats the market"" stuff is considered for the actual fund members/unit/shareholders, after fees and taxes, and over a long period of time, which is all legit but can be a bit misleading when you extrapolate and/or misinterpret the conclusions.  Funds often do beat the S&amp;P, they just can't do it consistently for a long period, and it's the fund managers that are making bank and not necessarily the investors, again at least on an after-fee/tax/10-year basis.  Individual investors absolutely can beat the market over a long period, but it requires the stomach for it (*you* try putting in REAL money, like $100k+ or whatever amount is ACTUALLY meaningful to you, watch it drop 20-50%, and then tell me how you're feeling), moderately high intelligence (like maybe 115-120 IQ ish), personal solvency and long time horizon (i.e. you don't need the funds for 10+ years so you're not forced to liquidate when you're down), and the *time* and *actual willingness* to do the research to find deals, which also means that you've reached an opinion on a company let's say that the rest of the market has put too low a value on and that you're right and they're wrong AND that will be corrected at some point in the future (which goes back to intelligence and time horizon).","i feel dumber reading this. if you want tech stocks buy QQQ, if not buy something else lol. people buy more than 1 ticker","The active side of the market cannot, more or less by definition, succeed more than the passive side. Active traders will see a range of outcomes, while passive traders will see the 'average' of those outcomes. There are a lot of mathematical nuances involved but that's the gist of it.  What will happen if more and more of the market goes passive? The opportunities for active management will grow, and thus the *potential* gains for active management. There will always be some winners to grab, for the taking, and that should keep active managers involved even if some of them are going to wind up being losers.  I mean, the stock market is inherently a zero sum game, if you define 'zero' as 'average returns'. That would be true even if passive investing never existed! It will be true even if passive investing keeps growing.  Now, things can get *wonky* if you assume passive indexing eventually gets close to 100% of the market, and that's where things can get interesting. That's an active area of study and nobody is sure what will happen, so there's no easy answer to give you."
investing,Feb,1aur19z,Do people take their returns and place it in with safer investments?,"My Roth is 90% stocks and 10% bonds.

My thought is protect that $5k   Is this something people do?",That's how you shoot your compounding in the foot.,"If this was a tree, it‚Äôd be like putting a cage around a new growth. Sure you ‚Äúprotect it‚Äù but you also stop it from growing to its full size over many decades.","It‚Äôs something people do, but it‚Äôs illogical.

Just keep your 90% stock to 10% bond ratio if that's the allocation you're comfortable with. The closer you get to retirement, the more people tend to put into bonds for preservation.","No.  If you wish to maintain a 90/10 portfolio then periodically you may wish to rebalance.  However rebalancing can also be done by contributions.  If for example you were now 93/7 you could add a higher share of bond purchases to bring that average closer to 90/10.  There is no point in ""locking in"" profits though.  Wealth is wealth.  Profits spend just the same as contributions.  In the longrun hopefully the vast majority of your portfolio is profits.  In the short term there is going to be volatility and the market may go down.  When it does just buy more and know you are getting cheaper prices.",Great analogy. Thanks,"If you started a year at $90 in stocks and $10 bonds and the stocks appreciated 10% while the bonds appreciated 5%, your ending allocation would be $99 in stocks and $10.50 in bonds.  Rebalancing regularly would be the prudent thing to do to allocate in accordance with your goals, so if you wanted to maintain the 90-10 split, you‚Äôd sell $0.45 in stocks and move it into bonds to get back to a 90-10 split on what is now a $109.50 portfolio. You wouldn‚Äôt take the full $9.50 between the gains in stocks and bonds and put it all in bonds.",Too young to be doing this IMO.,"Rebalancing is a useful tool, but rather than sell gains it can also make sense to just change your contributions for a bit until you hit your weight targets by investing less new money into the portion that‚Äôs overperforming and more new money into the portion that‚Äôs underperforming.","Investing neophyte here. I just read an article that suggests rebalancing your portfolio each year if you feel the need to do something. If your bonds have outpaced your investments, you‚Äôd sell bonds and buy stocks/ETFs to rebalance your portfolio to your stated objectives of X% stocks and 100-X% bonds, which would have you buying stocks that have gone down in value.   Same could be true of your situation. If your risk tolerance is 90% stock 10% bonds, you could sell stocks and buy bonds to achieve those proportions again.

For your personal investments, you‚Äôre in the early stages, throw everything you have at a low cost whole market ETF like VT or VTI. If you want to set aside 10% to play with some individual stocks, that‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs pretty rare that stock picking outperforms the market as a whole.  Also recommend you switch platforms.

It is clear that buying a stock within an index affects the index. It also clear that buying a fund that tracks the index also affects the stocks within the index. Every stock has a beta, which is the movement that can be explained via correlation to the overall market, and alpha, which is movement that is not explained via correlation to the overall market.  What I'm trying to understand is the nature of the relationship between NVDA vs indices ex-NVDA. Which of these is more true:  1) NDVA goes up -&gt; causes indices to go up -&gt; STOP.

I've talked to engineers at OpenAI about their different public models, they were all shocked by how much attention ChatGPT and DALL-E got from the public. It was completely unexpected, to them they were just trying to beat previous academic benchmarks in language modeling and text-to-image. They were great results but there was no expectation these would go viral with the general public in the way that they did.  The problem in investing is that the public interest spurs a lot of stupidity in behavior from company leadership. Public interest spurs analyst questions which spurs CEO initiatives that may not make much sense.","yup. if you have large enough market cap, you can move the market  just less noticeable nowadays with aapl and msft cause they don't shoot up 15% on a day",You should send a strongly worded email to the CEO of SPY,To the CEO of The Market
investing,Feb,1apjm12,Should I invest the money I'm saving for a down payment until I'm ready to buy?,"A little more context: My wife and I are saving up for a down payment for a house, and we're hoping to buy sometime in the next 2.5 - 4 years. And until we're ready to buy we also want our money to be making money for us over while we wait.   Our first thoughts were to keep our future down payment savings in one or two HYSAs earning about 4.5% APY since they're at a 15-year high. However, I know once the fed funds rate starts coming down, probably in the second half of this year, so will the rates for HYSAs. Another option we've considered is putting our down payment savings into CDs which will lock in a better rate (\~5.4%) for a year even if the fed funds rate goes down.   I've also considered putting some of our savings into a brokerage account and using it to invest in the S&amp;P 500 (likely FXAIX) and letting it grow over the next 2+ years. This could have greater returns. But of course we then run the risk of losing some of that money if the market drops.   Any thoughts and opinions are welcome.","I've been rolling 1 or 2 month T-bills for the last year or so with money I'm eventually planning to use for a house. Obviously in hind-sight having that money in the market would have been better, but it's been great having the peace of mind that comes from having a large sum earning essentially risk-free ~5%. To me the potential upside really isn't worth the potential downside of seeing that nest-egg disappear.   I actually have no real set plan or time-frame for buying a house but I plan to keep following the same strategy while interest rates are still relatively 'high'. I'd recommend the same for you.","No, do not invest it",Agree put in HYSA,"They're not tax free. You pay federal taxes on the gains. But they're exempt from local and state taxes. Which is a big positive for me. I don't have local taxes but I'm on California, my state taxes are 9.3%","We don‚Äôt talk about this very often here, but it makes perfect sense. In my opinion, in the opinions of statistics, for the last hundred or so years, houses make very poor investments.  That said, if you want a house, get a house. But it‚Äôs generally the biggest purchase we ever make, the most, we spend our money on, and it under performs the market by a pretty sizable amount.   There are key area where they outperform market. And if you can buy a Central Park condo or Malibu beach house, great. But your odds are far worse than trying to time the market.   There are reasons for houses besides appreciation‚Äîshelter is very handy. But I always hear of homes being and investment-class investment. And in the vast majority of cases they aren‚Äôt. Factoring in insurance, inflation, repairs, the returns are abysmal.   You didn‚Äôt contradict or even hint any of this. But it‚Äôs a post on houses in investing and I thought I‚Äôd put in my 1 cent","What about a money market, presuming you have a bit of cash to put in? You can get higher rates in a money market than a HYSA currently. I'm in PCOXX. I recognize the same issue exists with money markets as HYSA of course, but they are more flexible and give you a slightly higher return.  If you're sure you want to buy a house I'd be wary of putting it into an index since that could slip. Fingers crossed for you for a market correction...I just can't get over how expensive housing has become.","I agree but it is huge returns for what you put in as a down payment and simply having your money go to equity instead of rent is part of the returns. Opportunity cost and what not.  But to invest or not to invest is more a shades of gray question. Yes you should have some of your house fund invested, no it shouldn‚Äôt be all of it. Depending on timing and market circumstances you either buy a year or two earlier or you wait a year longer while saving up some cash if your investments lost value. In that case at least you‚Äôre going to have the stocks left over afterwards to hold on to.","Its actually pretty easy. Its under buy direct tab once you log in  1. Go to treasurydirect.gov 2.

Bit hard to read for old eyes but manageable once you pinch and zoom.","IMO a 2.5 - 4 year horizon combined with ""hoping to buy"" means I would invest it in the market and take the risk.","I was in this position. Now, the down you will have and your timing will be different between the two of our scenarios, but I would choose a split in investing and HYSA where if you lost some money in the market, it wouldn‚Äôt set you back years, maybe 6 months at worst.  I just bought a home. It is my first purchase with 450k down. To this day, I still wonder ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù a lot had I just hedged a little money in the SP500 starting back in 2017/2018 and not kept so much in a ‚ÄúHYSA‚Äù that was paying like 2%ish at best.  Now given my specific scenario, losing 10k-20k wouldn‚Äôt have made my monthly payment  unbearably difficult nor hindered ability to buy, but there was enough potential upside that had things gone south, I still had the capacity to ride it out and buy a home."
investing,Feb,1ax2fmy,Wealth advice I would give to my younger self,"Here is some advice I would give to my younger self that I have distilled after a decade of starting my career. I still have a long way to go, but these are hard-earned learnings I thought of sharing. I will keep it as compass for remaining decades of my life. I hope, it can be of some help to you too in your own money journey.  **#1: Become financially educated.** Our schools and society don‚Äôt teach us much about money, so you must learn it yourself early on. Learn to earn, spend, manage, invest, and grow wealth. Personal finance is neither complex nor boring, so don‚Äôt outsource it. It only takes a bit of effort to master a few key ideas and practices. This little effort will massively reduce stress about money from your life.  **#2: Have a vision for yourself.** Plans don‚Äôt always work out the way we imagine, but being intentional helps. Visualize how your life would be like years and decades out. Your future image should come from a place deep inside of you, not from your ego. Don‚Äôt think of grandiose ideas about how big you will be one day. Instead, aim to be financially independent early so you can do things that add meaning to your life.  **#3: Choose right work.** Choose a profession where you can enjoy the work even when results are not visible in short-term. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, just follow your intuition. It‚Äôs your best guide. Don‚Äôt choose a role because it feels prestigious or offers little more money. It will take a long time to become at good at anything, so choose work that gives you energy. Getting this right is way more important than accumulating wealth.  **#4: Maximize your earnings.** Once you have chosen your craft, think about how you can maximize your earnings over time. Invest in yourself and over-index on learning new skills. Try to become a more valuable person each passing year. Most importantly, be in the right environment. There are certain markets‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike different industries and geographies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat will compensate you much better for your skills. For instance, job in the Bay Area would pay a lot more for same engineering skills than most parts of the world. Make all effort to transition to the environment that‚Äôs best for you. That will compound your earnings, connections, and happiness in the long-term.  **#5: Spend way less than you earn.** There is no shame in living frugally, especially in early part of your career. Aim for savings rate north of 20%. If you do that, you will keep more and need less to be financially independent. Deeply ingrain the idea that happiness does not have a lot to do with money. Precious things in life are free anyways, be it spending time with loved ones or losing yourself in your craft.  **#6: Invest in fast growing assets.** You will become wealthy when you own assets that can grow fast in value, like real estate or stocks. Stocks are volatile, but easier to manage. Real estate is more stable, but requires oversight. If you don‚Äôt want to manage individual stocks, buy diversified index funds. The key is to buy and hold for the long-term and let the growth compound. Things that don‚Äôt generate cash, like gold and bitcoin, are speculative. Play around with it if you want, but don‚Äôt make it the centerpiece of your investing strategy.  **#7: Aim for a few big hits.** There are a few asymmetrical bets that can have massive payoff. You can start a company or a join an early-stage startup with equity. You can start a side business or become a creator to share useful content with the world. You can even invest in undervalued stocks or real estate. These bets can take many forms. The odds of success of any one is low, but you can try as many times as you want. All you need is one big hit to change your life.  **#8: Know what you are chasing.** Play your own game. Do not compare with others because someone will always be in a better spot. Know when and what is enough for you. Don‚Äôt obsessively chase a target net worth number. Don‚Äôt revolve your life around a spreadsheet. Instead, know how much you need so can design a life you want to live. You will get lasting happiness only when you travel on your own path.

My 5 star holdings at the moment: O, PFE, BAYRY, BTI  Of those, only BTI is a position I've held for long, others are new in the last year or two and added due to dividend, sector and star rating (undervalued).

This means if the stock goes above $110 before the expiration date then they can force you to sell them 100 shares at $110 per share  What this means is that you're protected from the price of the stock rising, because you already own the 100 shares. So even if the stock rises to $120, you're making money either way  You make the premium for the contract. If the strike price isn't reached, you simply make that premium and the contract expires worthless  The main point is that you can't lose infinite money like you could selling a ""naked call""  Let's say you didn't own the shares and sold a call option. If the stock price went infinitely higher, you'd be forced to buy 100 shares and sell them instantly for the strike price","Rebalancing.    Each stock is X percentage of your overall portfolio.  As the prices change, those percentages change too so you occasionally sell/buy a bit of each to get back to the percentages you chose initially.","Honestly it's hard to do that lol, but I'll try to simplify a little bit  You own a stock that you like for $100  You sell someone a call contract. They pay you $5 for this contract  The contract says that you are required to sell them that stock at $110 anytime before the contract expires  **Scenario 1:** If the contract expires and the stock never reaches $110, then you made $5 for the contract and you still own the stock  **Scenario 2:** If the stock goes to $120 during the contract, then they force you to sell your stock to them at $110. This would be losing the trade, but you still make money. This is the benefit of the ""covered"" call  In a ""naked"" call, you don't own the shares. So in the 2nd scenario you'd be forced to pay $120 and instantly sell for $110. If the stock went to $1000 you'd have to buy it and sell for $110. Losses are theoretically infinite.

I‚Äôm certainly not able to question it or apply it to a stock price or competitor stock price.  You just confirmed that my self-appointed ""noob data scientist"" title is justified. I suck at translating concepts to business :(  I'll try to rephrase. Basically what I meant to say boils down to: - Data centers renew their equipment every few years. By the next cycle, Nvidia's probably going to be #1 because it takes time for competitors to enter the market. In 2-3 cycles, the others might start catching up. As a result, sales are kinda guaranteed for a decade. - Lots of AI is being pushed to end-user devices (i.e. running directly on smartphones, VR, etc). These don't depend on Nvidia, and are on the rise (e.g. see Qualcomm Snapdragon CPUs, or Samsung smartphones), so *maybe* less need for expensive/cloud GPUs. - I wasn't trying to analyze the stock's performance or future potential, I was only trying to give a **slightly** deeper context into the ""AI moat"" of Nvidia.","I think this is a pretty coherent analysis - as a scientific computing developer, there's really no other game in town. The Nvidia software stack is just more fleshed out than the competitors, and although shops like Intel have a rich history of building this kind of technology (e.g. MKL), they're too far behind in hardware to really move the needle. ROCm/HIP (AMD) just aren't there yet (while I like the idea of open standards, they're just too decoupled from hardware), and I'm not confident that they will be anytime soon.  The training/inference distinction is an important one, but custom silicon is already on the radar for Nvidia  https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-chases-30-billion-custom-chip-market-with-new-unit-sources-2024-02-09/  They're not as advanced in this space as others, but they have great fundamental chip design expertise, so I have no doubt that they will catch up quickly. TPUs (Google) are just tensor cores (Nvidia) on steroids. If they ever break into the FPGA market, things will get interesting","AMD's MI300 is competition for nvidia.  They have challenges but they will sell everyone they can make this year.  The issue is software, AMD is years behind if they want to compete on a level playing field.  Their strategy has been to primarily outsource the development of that software to 3rd parties, the opensource community, or the big cloud guys.  AMD has historically not had a great reputation with developer support.  Maybe that changes under Victor Peng, time will tell.   AMD is going to do fine with GPUs in data center, just not on the same scale as Nvidia.  AMD is projected to sell about $4-6B in DC GPUs this year.   Nvidia will likely do over $100B.","Couple things. It takes time to ramp and build a chip that is CUDA compatible. Next, they have to get fab time at TSMC. Between Apple, NVDA, and AMD there isn't much current node or current node -1 capacity available.","Really great post, appreciate the *in the trenches* insight.  re : Nvidia's moat is less than you might think  Inferencing is pretty interesting in terms of Nvidia's footprint.  My comment here is that **the edge** is a market Nvidia will selectively play in, robotics for example.  The use cases you site (smartphone), yes, absolutely they will run from those.  Why?  Low margins, Nvidia is intentional about where they deploy resources, and there are plenty of well established players (apple, qcom) who are better positioned to service.  Do you have any comment about large scale inferencing 2025 and beyond?   I'm talking data center scale.  Right now the big CSPs seem to have two paths forward, GPUs or internally developed part (AWS Inferentia, Goog TPU and MSFT Maia).   I see internal parts being an obvious play for internal workloads.   My wonder is about external work loads, can they convert?    And then what about on prem?  GPUs or maybe Intel Gaudi seem the only solution.  At some point folks are already in the Nvidia ecosystem, so are switching costs reasonable?   And the smaller companies are, the costs are inverse.  On top of all this Huang said last week **inference is comprising on the order of 40%** of their data center revenues.  Seems unsustainable?","Yes, software is Nvidia's moat which is often forgotten or not mentioned.",Can you explain why AMD‚Äôs MI300‚Äôs aren‚Äôt competition for nvidia?

Yes he will pay 22% on that that $25k but I don't see a scenario where he will pay less in the future by not converting it.

You guys are all great.,"You don't clarify on your IRA being trad or Roth.  Any Roth balances have no taxes or RMDs.  So if some of that $800k is Roth IRA your problem is already smaller.  For the trad IRA portion instead of withdrawing more than you need to cover spending you can convert some of it to Roth then it is tax free forever.  The amount you convert is taxed as income just like a withdraw but it is not tax sheltered for life.  Obviously you wouldn't want to convert a huge amount at once but converting $20k a year can make a difference over 15 years.  The general idea would be to spread the conversion out over a large number of years to limit the max tax rate.

investing,Feb,1ajchbw,My company is allowing some staff to buy shares. What do I ask to find out more?,"My company (private not public) told me today that high-performing staff are being given the option to buy shares in the company.      The problem I have is that this is being taken out of our bonus, and we have the option to use a fixed percentage of our bonus (25% or 50%) to buy shares.     On the one hand, I appreciate the ""thanks for your hard work"" offer, but at the same time, this feels like gambling. As far as I know, the company has no plans to go public in the next few years.      The company is in series B and has so far had 3 rounds of investment since being founded.      All I knew to ask so far was what happens if I leave. They said they will buy the shares back. Every year they will also have a set period where we can sell them back. So they could technically choose the period in the year when they're at their cheapest I guess. But also since this is a private company, who decides what the shares are worth?     Please tell me what I need to ask the company to find out more. So far I'm leaning towards a hard ""no thanks"" simply because I don't know enough about the company's financials, or if I get taxed when I sell them back (I'm in Asia), or who controls the price of the shares.     &amp;#x200B;","Shares in a private company are basically a lottery ticket. It might pay off someday, but that won't happen until they go public, or someone else acquires the company. The shares have no real value until you are able to liquidate them. Who knows when that will happen?\*  The fact they want to take money out of your bonus to give you the shares is a non-starter for me.   \*Did they tell you they are going public in a year? Know that every start-up says that. All of them. I used to work for a company that was ""just 2 years away from IPO"". Very promising company we all thought was going to make us rich. They've been 2 years away since 2013 and have gone through multiple layoffs since then because of financial difficulties.",Seems strange.  I'd skip this.  Most companies allow all employees to purchase private stock shares with their 401k.  Targetting certain employees just sounds irrational.  A little strange that the company is also targetting employee bonuses too.  Definitely won't buy the companies stock with a promotion that targets my bonus.  Won't do it.,"Skip it, take your bonus money and invest it on your own. I‚Äôd only buy company stock if it‚Äôs offered at a discounted rate like most SPP‚Äôs which is usually at a 15% discount.","For every Shipt, there are 10,000 companies you've never heard of because they never went anywhere. Odds are you aren't working for the next Shipt.  If the company wants to give you shares, or options to buy shares at a later time, that's great. Take them. But taking money out of your bonus to buy the shares. No, not for me, and not something I recommend.","The stock does have a value, and there should be occasional liquidity events that allow employees to sell their shares. You wouldn‚Äôt typically have to wait until they go public.",&gt;Shares in a private company are basically a lottery ticket  A lottery ticket that can also be planned to be diluted prior to any acquisition or IPO.,"It sounds like a startup, and they're lean on cash, so they're offering stock to their 'top talent' -- because they're trying to give them some golden handcuffs...  The idea being that it motivates them to stay, and share in the potential windfall if the company does go public.  I'd only get into this arrangement on the following conditions:  * I'm young and have a high tolerance for risk.  * The shares are being provided at a modest discount from their estimated value, and the cash-out value (whenever that happens, and for whatever reason) is never lower than the original estimated value.  * I believe that the company is on the right track, making good decisions, and that key players are going to stick around.","There's so much random advice here.  Step 1) Are they giving you shares or options? If they gave you options, you would have to spend your own money anyway to exercise those options. If they are giving you options, you need to know 1) the fair market value of the options today and 2) the strike price - what you need to pay to exercise.  Step 2 - Figuring out if it's worth it. Does it feel like gambling? Yes, but gambling has an insanely bad rap bc, in games like blackjack, your expected value is negative. Is your expected value negative or positive in this case? It's really hard to figure out but the point is ignore people who are like ""stocks are scams"" or ""shares are like lottery tickets"". Yes it's like a lottery ticket - but you work for the lottery ticket company and have access to insider information. It's more fair to call it a ""risk"" but you can lower the risk by doing everything you can to understand the company.  Questions: - who decides what shares are worth? I am not sure in Asia, but in America, a 3rd party comes in after the round to evaluate ""Fair Market Value"". Investors need to know a number to participate in the round. This is the number you need to know. - Taxation: In America, this gets really complicated. It depends on the type of investment, how long you hold it, the value when you got it, and the value when you sell. You need to talk to a tax professional in your area.  A ""no thanks"" bc I don't know enough IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. Stocks can go to 0 and be a wasted investment. However, stocks in private company that successfully goes public or does get acquired down the line could set you up for life. Avoiding bc ""I'll get taxed"" also not acceptable.  Price of the shares is not controlled. It is set based on the investment bank you are working with's due dilligence of the market as well as investor appetite as well as the larger VC industry as a whole.  I'm saying all this bc I have seen numerous folks ignore buying stocks bc ""it was too complicated"" and miss out on huge paydays. That's not the right way to go about it.",They are offering a 30% discount on the fair market value. But who decides what that value is?,The vast majority of returns are way less than 1000x.
investing,Feb,1avt0yx,Im dumping my 2050 Fidelity TDF for FXAIX S&amp;P500,"Man I‚Äôm kinda pissed.   I have a TDF for  2050 (26 years away) so I haven‚Äôt checked on it in a while.   It‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù at this stage and since the S&amp;P 500 is up 25% in the last year, that‚Äôs what I expected to see when I just looked.  Nope, 11% growth.   Turns out this fund is in the bottom 22% percentile of its morning star category.    I don‚Äôt understand why TDF‚Äôs are being so risk averse when the date is 26 years away.  I know US stocks have not ALWAYS outperformed international stocks but aren‚Äôt we paying a fee for them to keep their finger on the pulse and adjust accordingly?   They couldn‚Äôt maybe read the room and see we‚Äôre in a major bull market and maybe put a little more into US stocks?  I‚Äôm going all in on S&amp;P 500 and *maybe* in 10 years all start to diversify to make it more conservative.     I know TDF‚Äôs are popular here but I just don‚Äôt understand how it could underperform so badly.   This one year (13% in lost gains) probably set my retirement back 3-4 years.   Edit:  just so you all don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ONLY looking at the last 1 year:  My TDF annual return over the last 10 years is 8.5%  S&amp;P is 12%  So that‚Äôs a difference of 3.5% annually over 10 years which realllly adds up.   Basically my retirement portfolio would be 40% higher than it is now.  2nd Edit:  since this TDF‚Äôs inception in 2007, its annual return has been 6%.   S&amp;P 500 over this time is 9%.  So 1.5x the returns.   This time period obviously includes the 2008 recession and S&amp;P 500 is still waaay better.","You'll never know if that's the right decision or not until down the road. and that's the risk.   Fwiw on TDFs, though, yeah 0.75% in expenses for a glorified global closet index portfolio (or really any portfolio) is disgusting and you probably should get out of that. The fund has been in the top 20% in its category going back 5 and 10 years, though, so don't let your emotions seeing a single bad one year comparison lead to you make a short sighted decision.   It sounds like the diversified nature of the fund is the problem you have with it, though, more than the fund itself. The reality is ""most"" people can't hold the S&amp;P 500 for their whole lives - it's too volatile during a lifetime and that's why the industry standard is diversification. If you believe you can set it and forget it, rarely look at it, and never have these same emotional reactions you're having here \*if\* US stocks do underperform sometime in the future, or heaven forbid an extended time, then it seems like a wise choice!","Are you comparing total return or just the price change?   Historical returns for the fund look pretty normal to me. One year return is also a pretty meaningless timescale.  The 2050 fund is currently at anout 90% equities, so it is very aggressive. The 10% allocation to bonds has a small effect on returns, but a decent risk reduction that can help the average person.  Are you in the actively managed version of the 2050 TDF or the index version? The expense ratio of the active one is pretty high and it would be ok to switch to the passive one.   The biggest downside to switching to FXAIX alone would be losing auto rebalancing, automatic risk reduction as you approach retirement date, and international diversification.  It would likely be a bad Idea to drop all international in favor of S&amp;P based solely on recent returns. This is classic recency bias and there is no guarantee that U.S. will continue to have outsized returns. The exact amount is debated heavily, but 20% to 40% puts you in the right ballpark   If you don't want to manage all of the above manually for the next few decades I'd stay where you're at (if you're in the index version)","Sp500 is the best or one of the best performing indexes right?   The TDF are way more spread out globally and they carry some bonds that have had some tough years. The currency risk is also spread out more than the SP500. So the 8,5% average gains are still quite good with the very spread out risk of the TDF.   Because the SP500 is 100% USA based all the issues of the USA could have an effect on your investment. Now and the last decades it went very well but if something goes wrong it could severely impact your wealth in the short term if there are some impactful issues in the USA. On the long term it will probably even out but if such a dip occurs when you want to quit you could have some serious issues. With a TDF the USA risk is smaller so temporary issues would set you back less","Not sure what you're looking at but going to M\* and looking at two different Fidelity TDF options:     FIPFX (Freedom Index 2050 Investor Class - passively managed) - 19.91% return in 2023 and ranked in the 56th percentile. About 10% in bonds.     FFFHX (Fidelity Freedom 2050 Fund - which is actively managed) - 20.46% return in 2023 and ranked in the 35th percentile. About 13% in bonds.     So, a couple of questions/comments:     1) What is the ticker for the fund you're in?     2) Neither of those bond allocations would not be considered particularly high, even for a 2050 vintage.     3) If you really expected a well-diversified portfolio of large, mid, and small cap US stocks, international stocks, and bonds to outperform the S&amp;P 500, you need to drastically reset your expectations going forward.",It IS more volatile. The international exposure makes it more aggressive than just the S&amp;P. You‚Äôre mistakenly assuming that risk and volatility guarantee return.,"So, that is a Collective Investment Trust (CIT). They're regulated a bit differently than mutual funds, which allows they to charge a lower expense ratio. The downside (to me) is that they don't have a ticker so you can't just research them in M\*, Yahoo Finance, etc. The only place you can get the info is in your retirement account.  It also appears to be the blend TDF, so they're using a combination of active and passive strategies.  Looking at the mutual fund data in M\*, the 2023 return for all the various share classes was in the 19-21% range and ranking between about the 25th and 56th percentile.  Going back 5-10 years, yes, the S&amp;P will likely have returned more; however, the last decade has been a period of US outperformance. You can find periods of international outperformance, and periods of bond outperformance compared to US equities.  The 2050 vintage that you're in is not a particularly conservative allocation and would generally be considered quite agressive given that it has in the neighborhood of 10% +/- fixed income. But, as has been stated, a TDF is not designed to outperform the S&amp;P 500 because it is globally diversified portfolio and is not constructed of only 500 of the largest US stocks.  You also shouldn't be comparing the target date return to any single index. You should be comparing the annualized return to the return you feel you need to reach your long-term goals. If you think that number is 10% annualized and the TDF is 8.5% annualized, well, then you can save more, move to a 2060 or 2065 vintage, or completely change your allocation to take more ""risk"" to try to closed that gap.  But if you can get to your long-term goals at the 8.5% annualized return, then there is not reason to take on more risk when you're already getting the return you need to reach those goals and taking less risk to do it.  Bottom line, is you do you. If you want to go all in on FXAIX, that is your call, though be sure you can truly stomach a 30-50% drop in the S&amp;P 500 and not do something stupid like move it all to cash near the bottom and not get back in until we're near a top. Hint: most investors think they'll stick it out in a true, extended bear market, but most can't and most don't because most people VASTLY overestimate their risk tolerance, especially those who have never had to endure a true bear market.  But being mad that a target date has ""underperformed"" the S&amp;P 500 during a strong US bull market is the direct result of unrealistic expectations because the TDF was never going to, and likely will never, outperform on the S&amp;P 500 on a pure return basis because that is not what it is intended to do.",I do FXAIX for my Roth every year.  This year I googled aggressive funds and it took me to a current morning star article that recommended three aggressive funds.  For the hell of it I googled the historic rate of return and 2/3 were at the same place twenty years ago.  Very odd.  FXAIX is a good bet.  Set and forget.,"The 100 year average for the S&amp;P500 is 10%.  If you want to invest in a bull market, go ahead. But be prepared to be brought back down to reality each time there‚Äôs a big correction.  You‚Äôll end up with around 10% in the end. If you can do better, start your own hedge fund and become a billionaire.",Invest by feels. Nothing goes wrong with that approach!,"&gt; They couldn‚Äôt maybe read the room and see we‚Äôre in a major bull market and maybe put a little more into US stocks?  Why'd you pick the TDF in the first place?  That's not what they are for.  They are made to be diversified, not aggressive.  They rebalance every year, but do not favor whatever is doing better or expected to do better (US, Intl, bonds)."
investing,Feb,1aqvf5c,Anyone actually living or pulling significant cash from dividends? What is your safe vs yield balance?,"There are some impressive yields out there. I hear the topic of living off/generating income from dividends brought up a lot in YouTube videos for example, it's a cool concept but is anyone actually successful while managing risk? I'd be afraid of my dividend gains going out the window every time the stock price drops since one would need a nice chunk of cash riding on it to produce these worthwhile yields. Is it better practice to just set a stop loss with these stocks or hodl?

Not much risk, diversification takes care of that.","There was a time when investing for dividends was a good strategy for a lot of people. Those days are long gone &amp; probably never coming back.  So, I invest for total returns (dividend + capital gains).        It used to be expensive &amp; difficult to sell stocks. Getting a dividend check periodically was much simpler.        Selling stocks is usually free &amp; a lot simpler now. I have a few automatic transactions set up to run every month.

The payout rates are generally not high.  Pure dividend income stocks/funds don‚Äôt move much.,"That's not nearly enough diversification for me.  I retired at 57 years old.   Investing doesn't have to be complicated or costly to be successful; simple &amp; inexpensive is most effective.         I invest 100% in total-market, index-based, low-cost mutual funds. Specifically, I use mostly Vanguard's    Total Stock Market,    Total Bond Market,    Total International Stock Market, &amp;    Total International Bond Market funds.    I've been investing this way for 35+ years. It's effective, simple, &amp; inexpensive.        www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting\_started  has some great free resources to learn about investing. After a few hours reading the articles, and, especially, watching the Bogleheads Philosophy videos, most beginners can learn how to get better results than most professionals.  Bogleheads is named after John Bogle, founder of Vanguard.        My asset allocation (ratios of the funds mentioned) is based on my need, ability, &amp; willingness to take risks.  Market conditions are not a factor.  Vanguard's investor questionnaire (personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire) helps me determine my asset allocation.        Buying individual stocks or sector funds creates unnecessary &amp; uncompensated risk; I avoid doing so.  Index funds are boring, but better for making money.  If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 5-10% of my portfolio in individual stocks.  As it is, I own pretty much every publicly-traded company in the world; that's interesting enough for me.        All of the individual stocks &amp; sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors.  Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one.  I'm a member of the Triple Nine Society, but I'm not smarter than all of them.  If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.        I prefer mutual funds, but ETFs could also work well.  The differences are usually trivial for a long-term investor, especially if they're the Vanguard funds I mentioned above.  Actually, the Vanguard funds I mentioned above have both traditional mutual fund shares &amp; ETF shares; they both represent a piece of the same fund.        The funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds; these are excellent choices for many investors.  Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically.  Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors.        Other companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because they've been the leader in this type of investing for decades &amp; because Vanguard's customers are also Vanguard's owners.        I hope that helps!

VPU in Last 5 years has returned 4.85%.     Yes, electricity demand has been mostly stagnant in the past couple of decades (1-2% increase annually). However, considering that it is so timely and costly to construct power plants (for example, 5-8 years long from permitting to construction in CA), labor intensive, running power plants and distributing &amp; transmitting electricity and guaranteed profit margins through rate increases - one would have thought it would have some premium.

Otherwise their will always be a big hole in the bucket.  Think of it like having credit card debt at 17% while trying to save/invest with a goal of 10%. No matter what you are going backwards.   - Figure out you spending first.  - Find a budget (needs like rent gas food ext + some spending money). The remaining is your savings rate. This determines how long you have to work before you can retire).  - now re-evaluate your views on money. Do this by figuring how much spendable cash you make an hour. (Total monthly earnings- expenses = left over. Divide this number by the hours you worked. (This will show you what you actually make an hour that can be spent). It will likely be way lower than your work advertised hourly wage.  - now when you want to buy something not in the need category. Calculate how many hours you had to work to get it. Example. Door dash $30 (you make $30 an hour but spend $25 an hour on needs). So at $5 an hour spending cash you worked 6 hours today so someone could bring you food.

Things with a higher interest rate first and anything with a higher interest rate than you would make if it was sitting somewhere.   - invest in tax sheltered savings first.

Basically at 20% tax rate every 5th dollar would have gone to taxes but now you get to keep it and invest it. Then you pay taxes latter on it when you are in a lower tax bracket after years of that dollar compounding for you.  - now that you have cut spending, and understand how much your time is worth focus on savings rate. The % of your income you save Vs spend. If you only save 5% of everything you make you will need to work for 66 years to retire.  20% is 37 years. 40% is 22 years.

investing,Feb,1b082kc,What is the point of bonds when you can use CDs?,"I always hear people throw out the idea of a 60/40 portfolio especially as you get older near 45 or 50 &amp; up, but I never understood what the exact point of this is. Bonds behave similar to stocks, when a stock market crash happens like 2022, 2020, 2008 - bonds can get hit just as hard as stocks. Well maybe not quite as hard, but you still lose money if you have 40% of your portfolio in bonds or even if you had 100% of your portfolio in bonds.   &amp;#x200B;  And for that case most dividend stocks would take a hit too unless it's something that's not directly invested in stocks like JEPI or other derivative based products. Bitcoin got hit pretty hard in the 2020 and 2022 crashes as well, so crypto isn't safe.   &amp;#x200B;  But CDs - Certificates of Deposts. They are FDIC insured to 250k per account, and if you use Fidelity they can be deposit swept up to 1 million in FDIC insurance. They yield 5.0% to 5.7%, which is better than most bond portfolios over time have yielded, and just 1% off the average return of my wife's Edward Jones portfolio and 2-3% off the average return of the S&amp;P 500.   &amp;#x200B;  And Certificates of Deposit have ZERO RISK OF DIPPING IN VALUE! Your funds can be locked up, but if this is a retirement strategy, that's actually what you want - you won't be touching it until you retire anyways.  &amp;#x200B;  So are bonds useless if you can put CDs in your Roth IRA? There is no tax advantage what so ever to anything in a Roth as it's all taxed already. If you're in a Traditional IRA, dividends and yield basically are taxed as income anyway so no real advantage either way. So I just don't get why people use bonds if they have the option to balance their portfolio at all.",&gt; They yield 5.0% to 5.7%  I mean - they do right now when interest rates are high. But they'll drop substantially if/when interest rates are cut.,"T-bills have higher rates, are more liquid, and are free from state and local taxes.   Your question is the reverse of what it should be.",The only response that matters,That was my first thought. The question should be why would anyone buy CDs when you can buy a bond.,"Bonds are generally superior in terms of offering more options for rates and terms, and can be bought and sold before maturity (though you don‚Äôt have to).   BTW T-bills typically offer better rates, more liquidity and lower tax burden than CDs.",No State Tax on T-bills,"There has also been many 5 year periods when bonds outperformed stocks in the US  (Around 30 in the last 118 five year periods). There have also been many 15 year periods when bonds outperform stocks.    And sometimes stocks can lose A LOT of value like in de 1929 in US, 90s in Japan etc... which is scary if you won't live much longer to see it",another question is why buy bonds that aren't t-bills.,"What about vinyl, man?

Presumably so insignificant that buyers won't be price sensitive and will buy at nearly any price. The uranium price might run a long way.,Wake me up when some of those get installed and are producing at scale.,"Isn't it ironic that the anti-nuclear lobby came from Environmental protestors in the sixties and seventies who thought they were doing the right thing for the planet? It's kind of a lesson in, modern politics. The downstream effects of any movement are very hard to predict, despite motive or solidarity in purpose.  Edit: Also I agree totally with your ""people smarter than me"" comment. But I'm always extremely paranoid of Charlatans and people who have their own agenda. I've concluded that the worst these online voices could probably do here is attempt a pump and dump, or that they may have some inside connections with specific corporations. So I'm still all in.","I forgot the exact figure, but the price of uranium can multiply and still only represent fractions of a cent per kWh.

We still use environmentally dirty power sources more than we should given the technology we have.

investing,Feb,1arkuv9,Blackrock Vs Vanguard investment funds. Who owns the underlying companies. ,"I just learned this myself, a bit embarrassingly late, that vanguard is owned by it's investors. So in that case, if I invested in a vanguard fund, then I should also be the partial owner in the company in relation to my percentage ownership of the fund? Eg, if the fund owns 100 shares of apple, and I own 1 percent of the fund, then I own 1 share of apple. Of course in reality the ownership stake would be negligible.   Is this actually true? And do we not get voting rights in each underlying company due to just how many there are and how insane it would be to tally every single investors vote for every single company, in say the SP500. Or is it because we only own a partial stake in vanguard and it means nothing for the underlying companies they invest in? If someone had a larger, majority stake in a vanguard fund, would they have voting rights, or am I missing something?  Next question is about BlackRock. It's a public company. So if I invest in a BlackRock fund, who is the owner partially, of the underlying companies? Is it me indirectly through my stake in the fund, while the shareholders in BlackRock profit from the money BlackRock earns through charging me fees. Or is it the shareholders who own BlackRock and then BlackRock invests in companies with the money provided by investors?",Why do i think you only have $5k invested in vangaurd and you are asking about voting rights that are usually reserved for those with $5m -5 billion,"Vanguard has proxy voting, so all of the owners of certain vanguard funds have the option to vote on company decisions, and the majority opinion of the vanguard fund shareholders determines how vanguard casts their vote.","Yes - it's true.   Pretty much all funds are structured as RICs under the Investment Management Act of 1940. It's why many funds are referred to as '40 Act funds.   A fund is a separate corporate entity and the investors in the fund own shares of the RIC.   It's also why if an investment manager fails, the funds are still protected because they are separate entities.   As for voting - both Vanguard and Blackrock provide proxy voting services.","Probably because anyone with those voting rights is out there making money hand over fist and not asking about anything in Reddit forums, much less how voting rights work.",You're correct. (little more than that but still negligible). Just something that I didn't know about and seemed interesting.   Also I'd like to add that I've stated I'm not too interested personally in the voting rights.,Technically these funds don't actually own shares. They own the rights to shares which are held at a custodian who technically owns all the stocks (historically it was all literal sheets of paper getting moved around),"&gt; So if I invest in a BlackRock fund, who is the owner partially, of the underlying companies? Is it me indirectly through my stake in the fund,  Yes  &gt;Or is it the shareholders who own BlackRock and then BlackRock invests in companies with the money provided by investors?  No, the funds are separate companies just sort of administered by blackrock ; see greytoc comment",Fund managers have a stewardship policy or use a third-party. You would have to check with the investment manager.

After Bernie Madoff no sensible investor would invest with a company where the company was both the custodian and the investment director. At vanguard, they direct the investments. For the most part, vanguard uses passive index products, but there are some active products. When you buy shares of VTI for example, you have a right to a portion of that pools assets, but not the voting rights since vanguard is a degree of separation between you and the stock market. Vanguard then must follow through on their promise to allocate the pool to track the Russel 3000's weights as per the prospectus. The shares themselves are owned by a custodian company, kind of like a bank for stocks.  If vanguard was both the custodian and the investment director, you can pull of shady ponzi scheme stuff like Bernie Madoff. With that separation, you're protected.","This is pretty much irrelevant . It's easier to hold shares in street name vs trying to assign shares to 2 billion different people, what would be a total mess.  If you are a large company say MSFT, do you realize how much of a pain it would be to track daily the 1-2 billion people/companies/organizations  (just making up a number) who actually own the shares each day or is it easier just to let the custodians do that?"

I‚Äôm open to suggestions of other changes I can make.,Another vote for sp500,Id just go all s&amp;p 500 if you can,"I also would support putting your investments in a SP500 fund.   The problem with a Vanguard Target 2060 Fund or another fund just like it is that it is loaded with bond like investments which over time will cause you to underperform a straight SP500 investment.  Since you are very young and have lots of years ahead of you, go with the 100% stock option.  Congrats by the way for being able to put such a sizable chunk of money in the 401K each year!  Not everyone can save at that rate.  Since you are only 3oYR, you keep that up and you will not have any retirement money issues.","1. Most people can easily manage their own 401K. 2. I wrote the following comparing TDFs to a US total market stock fund.  Everything in it applies to comparing between TDFs to an S&amp;P 500 fund except that an S&amp;P 500 fund has even less diversity than a US total market fund, so it's even less suitable to be the only thing in a retirement portfolio. 3. A lot of people have claimed that TDFs are too conservative for a young investor. I disagree, though it does depend on the fund &amp; the investor. Bonds account for very little of the difference in performance between an all-US-stock portfolio &amp; many TDFs designed for young investors.        Bonds have had little impact on the performance of these performance TDFs; it's mostly been the international stocks.  Adding international stocks doesn't make a fund more conservative.  Historically, US stocks &amp; international stocks have taken turns outperforming each other. US stocks have dominated recently, but that tide could turn at any time.        I'm most familiar with Vanguard's TDFs, so I'll use them as an example. I've never invested in one, but they're a great choice for a lot of investors who value convenience &amp; are willing to pay a little bit for it.        Vanguard TDFs start out with a 90/10 stock/bond allocation &amp; stick with that for many years before starting to gradually shift more towards bonds twenty-five years before the target date.        The difference in performance between a 90/10 portfolio &amp; a 100/0 portfolio is usually pretty small, but the difference in risk is usually much larger. This makes it much easier for an investor to hold onto the TDF through a bear market instead of selling in a panic, a move that would cost much more than the performance difference.        For a US-only portfolio, over the last 30+ years, the performance difference has been less than 0.4% CAGR. However, the risk (standard deviation) difference has been about 1.5%. (I expect longer time periods would show similar results.) 22 years into this comparison, the 90/10 portfolio was slightly ahead. Only the longest bull market in US history created much of a gap.        Why then, you may ask, have funds like Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund (VTSAX &amp; VTI) beaten Vanguard's TDFs by such a large margin recently? The answer is not bonds; it's international stocks.         So, pick an all-US-stock portfolio (total market or S&amp;P 500) over a TDF if you like. But please understand that the TDF is only slightly more conservative &amp; has its own advantages. Of course, past performance is not an indicator of future results.     https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&amp;mode=1&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=1972&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2023&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;asset1=TotalStockMarket&amp;allocation1\_1=100&amp;allocation1\_2=90&amp;allocation1\_3=54&amp;asset2=TotalBond&amp;allocation2\_2=10&amp;allocation2\_3=10&amp;asset3=IntlStockMarket&amp;allocation3\_3=36&amp;asset4=GlobalBond        I didn't include international bonds in my analysis because their impact on the portfolio is small.  Also, the comparison period would have been much shorter because some years of data are not available for international bonds.","I manage my own with a TDF and S&amp;P mix. You'll beat most investors with just the S&amp;P 500 it's riskier though imo. That's why I use the TDF for bring that risk down a little and it works in my brain.   Better than buying 20 stocks and selling, failing to meet the market gain and then paying a guy",Keep your money where it is now and make future contributions to s&amp;p500.

And then learning not to touch it.  Once you get to that 100k mark, you‚Äôve learned the behaviors and habits necessary to successfully see 1mil soon.  So you go about life, maintaining your saving habits, and poof, 1mil is there.  There are other reasons too of course and there will always be exceptions.  But some would say that once you enter your 30s, life kinda blurs.  Your 20s have so many milestones and events, typically speaking, you‚Äôve settled into a routine during your 30s and 40s, so the perception is a blink of an eye.","Believe it or not, you're doing it right.

investing,Mar,1bify2n,Can You Guess How Many Americans Actually Retire With a Million Bucks?,"That is the title of an article on [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/many-americans-retire-million-dollars-140019814.html) which provides some answers to that question.  You may be surprised to learn that only 10% of retirees have over a million dollars in savings.  Additionally, the average retirement savings by age:   &amp;#x200B;  * $426,000 for those aged 65 to 74 *  $357,000 for those aged 75 and older  These numbers are very concerning.  What are investors doing wrong that causes this shortfall for so many people?  In my view, the number one cause of not saving enough for retirement is not having a budget that keeps spending below income.  This takes discipline and requires a person to delay large purchases until the budget allows.  That is hard for many to do.   If the retiree has been diligent in investing in the stock market over their lifetime but still comes up short, it is likely because they did not follow a long term buy and hold strategy with broad based USA stock ETF's.  The temptation to try to time the market cycles by selling when things are looking bad and trying to buy back later is just too great for many to resist.   Nobody can time the market consistently.  What do you think?","Average is skewed by the wealthy.

Since it‚Äôs the only major airplane manufacturer in America and basically has a global duopoly with Airbus, seems like the odds that it doesn‚Äôt somehow recover from this are quite low.   Biggest counter argument is that although GM was too big to fail as a company the stocks issued before it got bailed out and went through bankruptcy are worthless.","It might be ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not too poorly managed and fucked up for its stock to stay low for a long time or drop even more.","Case in point - Citigroup, literally too big to fail but still down 90% from its pre-financial crises peak 15 years ago.","GM and Citi were too big to fail and they still exist today, however GM shareholders were completely wiped out and Citi shareholders lost &gt;90% of their value and never recovered.","It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs too big, it‚Äôs that the DOD can‚Äôt afford any more consolidation in its aviation supply chain. It won‚Äôt be allowed to fail for that reason alone.","Boeing may be too big to fail but that doesn‚Äôt mean shareholders won‚Äôt get fleeced. So wouldn‚Äôt put it at a guaranteed return but this isn‚Äôt something that can‚Äôt be fixed. A management shake up at the top, or a very public we are here to fix these problems would go a long way.","Case in point, While Airbus has substantially recovered from its COVID lows and is now reaching new ATH‚Äôs (as well as the broader S&amp;P up 83% in 5 years), Boeing is actually priced lower now than during the peak of the COVID outbreak and is down over 50% in 5 years.  Until i see substantial improvements from management and production, I think it will continue to get worse before it gets better. Airbus is currently producing 50 A320‚Äôs a month, and they are trying to get it up to 83. Boeing is now hard capped at 38 a month now due to the FAA investigation meaning their sales will be hard capped.

investing,Mar,1b49rq4,Is reaching the $100k milestone the hardest to attain?,"Charlie Munger famously said that the initial $100k is the most challenging to acquire, but does this adage remain relevant today?        As I approach the milestone of saving $100k within two years, my sights are set on the more formidable goal of reaching $1 million. Does this larger sum truly present a greater challenge?        It's been suggested that the time required to amass $100,000 is approximately one-fourth the time needed to accumulate $1,000,000. But in the current landscape, do these proportional challenges still hold true?        I wonder if others can relate to these concepts and if they still resonate in today's financial climate.","I am working on my 2nd million.  Gave up on the 1st million, it was too hard.","I ran the numbers in excel just for fun and I came to that same 1/4 number with never hearing it before.   Assuming you save $10,000/year and get an 8% annual return it would take you: 7.6 years to go from 0 to $100k 4.8 years to go from $100k to $200k 3.5 years to go from 200-300k 2.7 years to go from 300-400k 2.3 years to go from 400-500k 1.9 years to go from 500-600k 1.7 years to go from 600-700k 1.5 years to go from 700-800k 1.3 years to go from 800-900k 1.2 years to go from 900-1 mil  This is a very basic example, but using these assumptions it would take you around 28 years to hit $1 million, of that 7.6 years is getting to the first 100,000 or roughly 1/4. It‚Äôs also worth noting that the next 2 years add up to 8.3 years so $300,000 is the approximate half way point.","Nah, if you're going for a 1mn speedrun, the trick is to invest as much as you can as early as possible, because of compounding  However, now - this is the real trick. Wealth is only a means to an end. You use it to buy satisfaction / happiness / welfare / enjoyment / etc. via goods and services  Wealth has diminishing returns - having 100k vs. 0k saved is a huge difference. Having 1.1mn vs 1mn? Not so much  And age matters - if you spend your youth obsessively chasing wealth, you are postponing all of your experiences to your later life when you might not be able to enjoy them due to poorer health, energy, fitness, etc.  So... Take a balanced approach. You and your future self are like different people in a relationship. Help your future self as much as you can by investing, without sacrificing your own wellbeing now","The reason the first $100k is the most difficult is because it means you have to change your lifestyle to start saving to begin with.  You could say the same about $50k or $10k.  In order to start saving money you have to have a job that pays enough so that you‚Äôre net positive after all your bills. You also have to make enough and be strict enough that you actually save rather than spend the net positive money on something frivolous.  Once you‚Äôve done that for long enough that you‚Äôve passed the point of your savings being your rainy day fund and now have enough so it‚Äôs truly savings, then it starts to become easier to make money.  With actual savings you can start investing in slightly more risky things where compounding interest makes a difference.  If you‚Äôre planning to buy a house and saved $200k just for the down payment you‚Äôre not there yet.  If you‚Äôve bought a house already and still have non-rainy day savings of $25k, it‚Äôs going to be easier to get to $1MM than it was to get to where you are now.",Straight from the Mitch Hedberg school of finance.,Thank you. Kinda disheartening hearing that I‚Äôll be grinding for almost 30 years to hit the first million lol,"Nah the difference is that you don‚Äôt invest the exact same amount every year. The trick is to increase your savings as you get older and make more money. The first $100k is tough, for sure, but if you invest more and more each year, it starts to snowball","That‚Äôs not really the reason, the reason is compounding growth. If you invest $10,000 per year @ 7% growth it will take about 8 years to get to $100k. That doesn‚Äôt mean it will take 80 years to get to $1M if you continue at this pace though, because your first $100k is still growing at that 7% growth meaning it only takes about 5 years to go from 100k to 200k. And going from 900k to 1M takes less than two years. Overall it would take about 30 years to get to 1M if you invested $10k per year at 7% growth, but 25% of that time is spent going from 0-100k",it is an old joke.  someone I worked with had perfect delivery and timing with it.,"I used to not be a millionaire.

investing,Mar,1bkr7y1,Let‚Äôs do some very basic math on the Reddit stock.,The market cap is currently at $8B.  There are 73M users.  Half of them are active.  Half of that aren‚Äôt bots.  Best case scenario each account represents $109 each.  Realistically that‚Äôs $400 an account.  So let me ask you: do you think your account is worth $109 to $400 ?  Puts open on Monday.  Have a great weekend.,"What are you talking about ?  I am not a math or valuation wizard but I know they use discounted value of future earnings or future cash flows or something. And they forward a few years to calculate that.   So the 109 bucks is equivalent to 10 bucks this year maybe 10% less for 2025 and another 10% less for 2026 and so on till infinity (realistically 10 years) and that adds up to 109.   So all you need to be worth is 10 - 15 bucks in 2024.   If you remove half bots as you contend, maybe your account needs to be worth 25-30 bucks for 2024.   And that assumes fixed number of users. Investors obviously expect growth in engagement and number of users so in my opinion if each account was only worth 10 bucks in 2024 with discounted worth in future plus growth in future, the numbers still work out.   You pay Netflix 200+ a year, Amazon prime wants 36 dollars a month to not show ads, Disney wants 60 bucks a year to not show ads, pretty sure 10 bucks is a reasonable number based on these comparisons.",You have $900 in your trading account and started trading options a month ago.

You eventually want the mortgage because the rates will be generally better than an asset-backed loan.","The loan rates are not much different usually between for example taking out a 10 million mortgage or taking out a 10 million dollar loan with your stocks are collateral  I have not done this I am not that rich but from my limited experience with buying property this is the benefit  Lets say I want to buy a 10 million dollar apt complex , I do not have 10 million cash but I have lots of investments but I do not want to sell them  I could go to the bank and try to get a mortgage and they might agree to loan me the money and the apt complex will be the collateral . This might take time, the bank is going to want to make sure the apt complex is actually worth 10 million , they might need to do some of their own DD to make sure if I skip out on the loan they can repo the property and hopefully sell it for around 10 million to get their loan back  They also might put some restrictions on the loan, say I must carry a bunch of insurance and maybe I even need to clear major remodels with them. They don't want me to buy the apt complex for 10 million tear it down then walk away leaving them a worthless pit of ruble right?  However if instead I take out a 10 million dollar loan by putting up my investments as collateral , I can quickly buy the apt and I will own it free and clear. The Apt complex is not the collateral , my stock and bond portfolio is. The bank really doesn't care if I am massively over paying and the apt complex is only worth 5 million , my collateral is not the apt complex it's my portfolio . I could buy the 10 million dollar apt complex then tear it down or do what I want as I own it free and clear  However with these type of loans , unless you are borrowing like 10 million + the rates are not great and you are basically better off with a regular mortgage where the real estate is the collateral","Nobody every talks about the risks associated with this kind of money move.  First, you're only going to get about half of what your asset is actually worth if you take a loan against it. Then you have to hope the assets don't drop in value or the banks are going to come knocking. After it's all said and done, you still have to pay back your loan. It's not just free money.  I hope you can efficiently leverage your assets to cover principal + interest.","Yeah, I highly recommend it.","Wow, it's so simple and elegant really.  It pays to be rich!",The main reason is to avoid paying capital gains and liquidate assets you do not want to sell yet,"That explains why someone would borrow money rather than just pay cash, but I think OP's question is why they would switch from an asset loan to a mortgage."

If nothing, then being scared over something you cannot control isn't very helpful.",A lot of people‚Äôs retirement plans are their house and that wouldn‚Äôt be reflected in the headlines you mention.,The economy is so good *because* people spend more than they can afford and because they are not saving for retirement.  Marketing is such a strong leverage on people's minds and wallets that they spend on giant trucks that are expensive and burn lots of fuel when a minivan would serve them so much better.  Those stupid cups that people were buying a few months ago are another example.  It's a big world and it's filled with people who don't give alot of thought to the future and their money.,The frightening statistic is how many people live paycheck to paycheck. Not sure how the economy is so good with so many teetering on the brink,Pretty horrible plan in that case.,Better than the alternative which is that they don‚Äôt save at all.,This is why Social security exists. If anything funding for that would have to change and taxes increased. Now who bears the brunt of the increases depends on who we vote for.,I think for me the fear is of some kind of forced transfer from those that have a retirement account to those that don't in the next 35 years lol.,That‚Äôs one of the big things so many people miss in the rent vs buy debate. Most people aren‚Äôt disciplined enough to save adequately. If you have a paid off house in retirement you at least have a place to live plus an asset that‚Äôs worth generally quite a bit.,I cant worry about everyone

investing,Mar,1bgjbmd,Does it ever make sense to use a 401k loan to buy a house?,"I'm thinking the losses I'll take having my 401k money our of the market would have to offset not having a mortgage, paying mortgage broker and recording costs, etc. With mortgage rates rising and now around 7%, does it make sense to take a 100k 401k loan if it gives you enough to buy a 500k house in cash?","I did it in 2021 to nab a house we needed. It wasn't a ""maximize your money"" move. We just needed it.   I'm happy I did it.","Soooo, as with most things, it depends.  The loan will be paid back with after tax dollars.  You will be paying the loan AND interest, but the interest and it will be reinvested.  If you default on the loan, the balance will be counted as taxable income in the year you default  BUT- the 401k is your money. You need to decide what your goals are. If a home is a big investment opportunity (usually it is) it may be smart to use your 401k if you have no other funds.  One reason to almost always use a 401k loan for a home purchase: to increase your down payment to 20% and avoid PMI (private mortgage insurance). This is an expense that does not pay down your loan or help you at all. It is insurance for the bank. If you stop paying, the bank gets your house and the insurance pays their expenses, not yours.  So if you only have 5% or 10% down payment, you should use your 401k to get to 20% down and avoid the PMI expense.   PMI benefits the bank. A 401k loan repayment benefits you.",The max loan you can take against your 401k is 50k. Just an fyi,This guy fucks. Listen to him.,"I took $100k out of my 401k using the CAREs act since I didn't know if my job or rental in NYC was in danger. Ended up buying an apartment way under market at 2.6% interest. However, I owed taxes on that $100k over 3 years. So it sucked and was awesome at the same time. But I didn't think of it as stealing from my retirement, i just moved the money into another asset, one that I can also live in and, and gain access to some tax breaks via mortgage interest.","You are ALLOWED to BORROW from your 401K for a house. I did that. You then PAY YOURSELF BACK instead of a bank or inchrring penalties. The repayment of your 401K loan typically looks exactly like your contributions do already. Bruh, its going back into your own 401k. Borrow against it.",Keep in mind it's typically the lesser of 50k or 1/2 the account value.,"Just like any other loan though.  Let's say you borrow $300k for a home.   Over 30 years that's about $900k right (with interest).   But since you gotta pay tax on the income used to pay it back,  that $300k home really cost you about $1.3 million.","Well, try this.  Add up the total cost of PMI. What did that accomplish for you?  A 401k loan is your money moved from one investment type (stocks) to another (real estate).  Paying your loan back is not a cost paid to someone else. You are paying yourself back and paying down your mortgage faster.  I think avoiding an expense is smart when you're choosing to invest that money instead.",&gt;The loan will be paid back with after tax dollars.  Irrelevant because the loan itself is paid in pre tax dollars. It's a net zero and the repayment is effectively with pre tax dollars.
investing,Mar,1bkazj6,"What to do after reaching $100,000 goal?","Hello everyone  A few months ago I started taking investing seriously.

Over the past several months, i've been dollar cost averaging big blocks of money money from the HYSA into the S&amp;P 500.   My goal was to hit $100k invested by age 30, and with my birthday next week, I can say I hit that goal. Once I reached that figure, I was going to pay my mortgage down ($220,000 @3.5%).  I am also considering dumping everything but $1,000 into the markets to have a clean slate at age 30. It would be cool to look back in 20 years and say ""yeah when I was 30 I had everything invested but $1,000."" That would mean dumping another $80k in. It would bring my stock S&amp; fund up to $180,000, with $170,000 of funds invested in just the last 6-8 months. Then the next few years I can pay down the house or invest more. It would also be cool to have a paid off mortgage by around age 32 also so may stop at the $100k like originally planned.

Given that you _want_ to pay down your mortgage though, keeping your current 80k in cash (or 50k or whatever), and taking the sure thing 5% can make sense.    Also, you may have this accounted for, but an emergency cash fund is important, so don't go down to just $1k in cash.",I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks this. I try to keep a low amount of liquid cash because I can always sell investments and have that cash within a few days if needed. The risk of being forced to sell during a market downturn doesn't outweigh the cash drag of leaving a larger pile uninvested long term.,"$1,000,000 goal",Various banks have CDs with 4-5% rates rn so highly likely = basically guaranteed.,"Congratulations! Here‚Äôs some advice:  1. Keep at least 3 months of basic expenses in cash.  2. It probably would be financially smarter to invest that money instead of using it to pay the mortgage. You can even buy bonds that have a higher yield than your interest rate.  3. If, however, you would feel less stress paying the mortgage early, then do it."

investing,Mar,1blvb2a,Can someone please explain why DWAC with a current market cap of 1.37 billion would be worth 4 billion after the merger with TS?,"Lots of financial sites are using the 4 billion number so obviously it's my mistake, I'm not denying that. Here's what I'm thinking, so hopefully someone can show me my mistake.   My reasoning is based on the fact that the number of shares generally doesn't affect the market cap. If a company has a 4:1 stock split, the number of shares quadruples but the market cap certainly doesn't.  DWCA is a shell company, and it's valuation is based entirely on the assumption that it will merge with TS. If that merger falls through somehow then DWCA would go to zero.  So the current market cap of DWCA is a proxy for what shareholders think TS is worth. If someone owns 1% of DWCA (3 million shares), they're hoping to end up owning 1% of TS after the merger.  So 1% of the current DWAC market cap is 137 million (1% of 1.37 billion), meaning 1% of TS is implicitly valued at 137 million. If the merger happened right now they would own 1% of TS, no matter how many shares that's divided up into.  Owning 1% of TS with 3 million shares and owning 1% of TS with 12 million shares (or a billion or whatever) still just means they own 1% of TS.

investing,Mar,1b6fi6e,Was told by an advisor to completely change my taxable brokerage portfolio,"Hi all. I recently had a free call with a financial advisor with Empower (my 401k provider). I have been considering going to a local fiduciary fee-only financial advisor service, but figured I'd give the call with Empower a shot first. I have my taxable brokerage account linked up with empower so I can track all my investments in one place. This means that the folks at empower can see the linked accounts and their holdings.  It was a quick 30 minute call where I was able to ask a lot of general questions I wanted answers to. One of the things he recommended to me was completely redoing my taxable brokerage portfolio. Over the past couple of years I have been making automatic direct deposits into my brokerage account every paycheck, and investing in low cost ETFs and high dividend paying ETFs and securities. I also have DRIP enabled so that the dividends would compound and buy more shares and eventually the goal was to get to a sizeable chunk of income that can be relied upon.  The advisor at empower said that at my age I need to be focused on growth only, and that high dividend-paying securities aren't very tax efficient at my age. I am 30 years old. Currently, about 30% of my portfolio is in good stocks that I like (PEP, XOM, MNST, INTC, VZ, T), and the other 70% is in low cost ETFs. Of that 70%, I have roughly 8% SPY, 5% VOO, 4% VUG, 7% QQQM, 16% JEPI, 11.5% JEPQ, 10% SPYI, as well as a few other randoms here and there. I went a little crazy researching low cost ETFs and ones with good dividends and just picked a few that I liked, instead of putting everything into one. I was mainly using JEPI and JEPQ for their divys. I know this portfolio isn't anywhere near 'balanced' so I would definitely like to make some changes. For instance I know SPY and VOO are very similar. I started investing in SPY first, and then found that VOO had a lower expense ratio and the shares were slightly cheaper. This makes buying more shares easier because currently I can't purchase fractional shares of ETFs through my brokerage (Schwab).  Long story short the advisor at Empower told me I should basically sell everything, and do 50/20/20/10 into an S&amp;P 500 Index, Small Cap Index, International Index, and Real Estate Index. This would allow that money to grow without me having to pay taxes on all of these high-paying dividend securities. He also recommended I look at the free Schwab Robo-advisor called [Intelligent Portfolios](https://www.schwab.com/intelligent-portfolios), which I did and it looks interesting.  I have to say that I am giving his advice some consideration, but first wanted to get some more opinions and also I am still planning to visit an in-person local financial advisor.  Edit: I appreciate the feedback so far. Yes, I understand I have made mistakes and the ETF/stock picks may not make sense to a savvy investor. I'm no savvy investor. I will take the advice so far and talk it over with an in-person advisor. I'm just starting out investing in a taxable account outside of my 401k, so I'm learning. Mostly the picks that I have are from reading articles about good low-cost ETFs, and I was focusing on high dividend options without realizing the tax implications. The the Google algorithm took over and just kept feeding me more articles about good dividend ETFs.     Edit 2: FYI for anyone who's still reading this. I'm currently maxing out my HSA contributions to the IRS limit and taking full advantage of my employer match and then some. All 401k contributions are currently ROTH only. I have considered doing half ROTH and half traditional to reduce my taxable income. Currently I have an emergency fund that should cover 4-6 months of expenses but it could be stretched if necessary. But to answer your question, no, I currently am not maxing out my 401k. I asked the advisor at Empower if I should stop investing in the taxable account until I am maxing out my 401k and his response was that it's always nice to have liquid investments. Meaning that my taxable account can be used in the event I need cash without the penalties of withdrawing from a retirement account.",Surprised myself that you got what seems like reasonable advice from a consultant. I applaud the guy who told you this,That sounds a lot more rational that what you have.  There will be tax consequences to selling what you have.  Make sure you understand the taxes.,The advisor is correct. At your age you shouldn‚Äôt have anything so dividend focused. That‚Äôs crazy. Especially in a taxable account. All your doing is paying more taxes.,"I'm shocked, for free too","This needs to be higher.  Without knowing dollar amounts or cost basis, the advice to sell everything may or may not be insane from a tax perspective.  Rather, re-allocating all new contributions is for sure the right way to go at the minimum.","Ordinarily I do not trust advisors, but he's right. At age 30 you want to maximize capital gains. Dividend paying stocks are slow growers and more suitable when you are closer to retirement.",Agree with the above. Would stress that in person local advisor could be hit or miss as they could use annoying sales tactics to get you to buy their products.,"The broker is right your current portfolio is bad for your age.  (The broker's recommendations are okay, tho the real estate part is a not great idea at best.)  &gt;  researching low cost ETFs and ones with good dividends  Get both of those ideas out of your head.  Neither concept matters, at all.  The only thing that matters at your age is total return (including tax implications) on your investments.",Yeah the guy was cool for sure.,VOO and VTI are 99% correlated. VOO and VUG are 95% correlated.  Just simplify things and pick VTI.

Another Chief Economist saying that ""higher for longer"" will in fact last for the rest of this year.  **Q:** Are higher interest rates Good, or Bad?         **A:** Depends on whether you're **earning**, or **paying** interest.  And, retired, I definitely fall in the ""earning"" camp -- if MMkt accts are dishing out &gt;5% ""nearly"" risk-free, I have no problem stashing my Social Security checks in them for a while.  But this is going to throw cold water on a lot of otherwise-wishful thinking, I'd say.",I think it would be fine. Markets already rallying like crazy without cuts. If we don‚Äôt cut it means the economy is strong and we aren‚Äôt in a recession,"People frenzying for rate cuts seem to believe that the market is *supposed* to have as low rates as possible, and that's not necessarily the case. The post-2008 low rate environment that fostered the 10 year bull run was really an anomaly compared to historical handling of interest rates.","&gt;  If we don‚Äôt cut it means the economy is strong and we aren‚Äôt in a recession  Agreed!  I've been (silently) of the belief that rate cuts ""to stimulate the economy"" are not a good long-term look -- if the economy -needs- stimulating, sumthin ain't right.",Stocks don't need a reason to go up. They just go up. Figure out the reason later.,It's good.  Its necessary for a stable long term market.   I'm not in this market for a good year. I'm in it for good and stable 40 years.   The prior low interests were imho abnormal. Fuelling too many bubbles. Slow and steady is the way to go.,"I think the massive layoffs we are seeing at many of these companies are warning signs though, even if there were abnormally high employment rates from covid. This could quickly go from ‚Äúbooming economy‚Äù to ‚Äúoh no another recession!‚Äù And Im not normally a bear. Definitely feels like things have slowed down in the spending category for many people outside of necessities, regardless what the stock market is saying.","I used to think these layoffs were an indicator but honestly, all these companies doing layoffs overhired in 2020-2022 and are now just rebalancing their budgets and/or using this opportunity to shed poor performers. I think this is different than say if these companies were laying people off cause the economy was in bad shape or if revenue/profits were taking a dive (which could still be the cause for specific industries rather than the overall economy). I think the overall market is just rebalancing itself to new normals like many of the tech workers getting laid off are still able to find jobs in perhaps less sexy companies or industries.","Muh housing costs are a big risk to the broad economy. Pending home sales are at levels lower than the worst of the GFC. Homes are simply too expensive and it‚Äôs a hard ask to convince someone to trade in a 3% mortgage for a 7% mortgage. Not the mention the stress this has caused banks as their balance sheets are full of treasuries/bonds at a huge loss, which is why the fed facility buying those back at coupon was huge in keeping the banking industry solvent. I agree that cutting rates gives you less ammunition to fight a recession, however, quantitative tightening should really be advancing faster right now irrelevant of rates. When the fed has a balance sheet this big already, more QE is just going to kick the can down the road regardless of the rate environment.","Rate cuts are based primarily on inflation and unemployment data, not the rate of economic growth. The Fed will cut rates if inflation continues to slow down even if GDP growth and unemployment numbers are excellent.",Market is forward looking so it is anticipating the cuts. Currently about 90bp priced in through year end. If that doesn‚Äôt materialize better believe equity market will reprice accordingly.
investing,Mar,1bphmju,Is Robinhood Gold worth it now?,"I know the general sentiment of Robinhood is poor and rightly so, but the benefits of Robinhood gold have been very intriguing lately. I have about 30k in my Roth IRA and if I transfer over then I‚Äôd be getting a 3% match which would be ~$900. The Gold card was also announced which is an unlimited 3% cash back on everything.  Seems like a pretty solid deal and honestly a little too good to be true for a $50 annual subscription (not monthly). The only cons I can think of are dealing with Robinhood, keeping my Roth there for 5 years, and the chance that fees rise, but I feel like the 3% IRA match greatly offsets the cost and is somewhat a SUB. Is this a no brainer deal overall or am I missing something?","The fact that RH has lost over $5B in the last three years makes me question their future solvency, as well as if any of these bonus promotions will be honored if they fail.  But I suppose that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre trying to bring new assets in and lock them up for five years‚Ä¶","It‚Äôs not a popular opinion but I think if you are maxing out your Roth contributions yearly it‚Äôs a no brainer. It‚Äôs literally free money. Even if they go under and get bought out, the gains made on the match is still worth it for me. And now the free credit card with 3% cash back? Icing on the cake","I‚Äôm asking myself the same. The subscription fee is negligible with the $1,000 off fee margin. Can pay the fee risk free","You gotta keep in mind, this is their MO. They were the first to do away with commissions. The average consumer doesn‚Äôt care about stock to order flow. They have bred some bad gambling type behavior with their app engineering but if you‚Äôre not a n00b and am aware of their slot machine tactics, confetti shouldn‚Äôt be the thing pulling you down. Their app is still one of the most user friendly. So, despite all the bad press, RH is still innovative and drives down the cost of investing for its users and I like it.

I appreciate what RH has done and is continuing to do.","I'm in line for the CC myself, waiting to see how it works out. I consolidated my old employer's 401k's there for the 3% match just last month too. Both had to be in-direct rollovers (which is why I never bothered) but the company (I think it was called Capitalize) they use made it easy because both my old ones hid where I needed to go to do it. And hand detailed instructions that a 5 year old could follow.  My only complaint was they notified me when they received the official check, but it still took 7 days to clear. BUT a full hold period isnt really something to complain about.  I know Reddit has a hatred for RH, but I see at least 30% of screenshots off their platform. So there's a bit of pot/kettle there.",Is insolvency actually a potential concern? I thought the customer owns the underlying assets in their IRA accounts?

investing,Mar,1b57pxi,How does my 401k actually work under the hood (serious)?,"I'm embarrassed to be 40 years old and asking this, but I'm struggling to understand how my 401k works. I have a workplace 401k and I've been contributing to it for 16 years. It's mostly index funds and is very stock heavy (80% domestic stock). I remember picking the funds years ago but beyond that, I don't know much. I currently contribute 16% of each paycheck and my employer matches $4000 max for the year.   What I don't understand is who is actually buying the shares? All I do is contribute and log in every once in a while to see where the value is at. Do I have an actual human broker at Fidelity who sees my contribution every two weeks and just buys a bunch of shares? Does a robot do it? I looked all over Fidelity's site and I can't seem to figure this out.   Would appreciate it. I'm one of those people who needs to know every detail of what's going on with my money and this has been driving me nuts lately.","The actual money is being funded by your employer each payroll. Each paycheck your contribution is withhold from pay, your payroll team calculates any match, and then uploads a spreadsheet to Fidelity with the detail, Fidelity debits your employer‚Äôs bank account, buys the shares and funds your account.",Don‚Äôt be embarrassed‚Äîunderstanding how your financial security options works is nothing to be ashamed of.

I have had it annually, quarterly and biweekly.  At each pay period is the best for the employee.","Your employer sets up the 401K plan.  Some of the rules are mandated by the government (ERISA) and the rest are set up by your employer.  These rules govern things like loans, fees, how the Rule of 55 would work at your company, whether a Roth option exists, allowing for voluntary after tax contributions, in plan conversions, and most importantly, **the menu of investment choices you have**.  Some employers do a great job selecting low cost funds from a variety of asset classes including target date funds.  Some do a piss poor job and saddle you with bad options, sometimes with exorbitant fees.  You enroll in the plan, pick your investments, how much you want to contribute each paycheck, select whether you want to auto escalate your contribution amount every year, etc.  These days I think the default is to enroll everyone in the plan and you have to actively opt out if you want.  That's not how it worked when I started working.  You're told about the plan but you have to actively opt to be in.  It's better now for sure.  Then every pay period your HR department calculates how much you're contributing.  The deduct that amount from your paycheck and send it to the plan manager, who then credits your account and automatically buys the investments you selected (basically a robot).  Since investment choices are mutual funds, you get to buy dollars of them vs. shares.  So when you say you want 80% of some domestic index stock fund and 20% in something else, the plan does that automatically.  HR also calculates when you've maxed out and stops the contribution from your paycheck.  They also calculate any matches you're qualified for or any profit sharing scheme.  The balance of what's left is direct deposited to your bank account.  There are barely any human involvement these days... everything is automated from your employer side in HR/payroll to the plan manager.  About the only time when humans are involved is when they're talking about making some changes to the plan or for periodic meetings just to make sure everything is running as it's supposed.  That's basically it in a nutshell.","Second to top comment for me, Reddit on purpose fudges votes in an attempt to combat biases so you gotta wait a bit to see how things actually shake out.",Go back to your hole.

investing,Mar,1b7jh3u,Wife wants to pay off low-interest mortgage. Need help with ideas.,"My wife and I owe about $124,000 @ 2.625% with 27 years left. My wife wants to get the house paid off ASAP with her additional monthly income, while I think she should invest it. It's her money and she can obviously do with it as she wants, but she doesn't understand the potential lost gains. I was able to convince her that she should put the money in an HYSA or index fund and pay off the house when that brokerage account reaches the total pay off amount. I figured this would save money in the long run vs putting that money straight towards the mortgage principal.   Would this would be the best compromise in this situation? Any better ideas with the understanding that his money will eventually go to paying on the mortgage?","Don‚Äôt put it in index or whatever, cause it is obvious your wife cannot tolerate any type of loss.¬†  Hysa or cd is fine as long as it is above 3%.","It might help to convince her by saying that having the money in a HYSA means that it's far more liquid than creating equity in the house. In the event of an emergency, you have the money on hand (growing at a faster rate) instead of having to take a line of credit out on the house and pay an interest rate on that.","One thing to point out is that even after you pay off the mortgage, you'll still have a monthly payment on the house for the rest of your lives. A lot of people think no mortgage = free housing, but you'll still owe property taxes and insurance, which for me is $800/month.   Wasting money to have no monthly payment ever again sounds nice. Wasting money to just cut the monthly payment in half sounds a lot less exciting",Tell her she will save 2.62% by paying off the mortgage but she can make 4%+ in an hysa account.  Why not make money and keep liquid,"Explain this way  We can pay 100k of the mortgage off and our return will be 2.65% or 2,650  we could buy 100k of 1 year USA treasury bonds and our return will be 5% or 5,000.  Would you rather save 2,650 or make 5,000?",Don‚Äôt forget maintenance and repairs.,If you are locked in at that interest rate over the 27 years left you'll pay an additional $50k.   If you used the $500 or whatever amount extra each month you'd pay towards your mortgage each month and put it into an investment account: you'd have an estimated portfolio value of $406k assuming a 6% return per year.   Don't payoff a locked in interest rate that low early. Invest the extra income.,Why does she want to pay it off? Is it because it makes her feel better? If so maybe find a way to put it in investments which can be liquidated to cover the mortgage should you need.,Good idea!,How much is $3k to you guys? We're talking about a potential extra earnings of $3k per year (minus taxes) if you don't pay off the house.  $3k to me and my wife isn't that much. If it made my wife that much happier and less stressed then it's worth missing out of the $3k for her peace of mind.
investing,Mar,1bn9012,Where does the money comes from in a bull run?,"I see many people pointing out that the current bull market is a bubble and that a fast growth like this has to be met with downturn.   It got me thinking why there is a bull market in the first place. Obviously, the market is growing thanks to new technology and geopolitical stability. But what I struggle to grasp is where all this money comes from? Was it stored on saving accounts, moved from commodities or real estate, self generated by the banks?  I feel like that without understanding why there's money to create a bull market, I can't understand how the bull market would become bearish.  Therefore, I would be glad if anyone can answer my question.","In general, in a bull market money flows from bonds to stocks because the returns become more attractive, and the opposite in a bear market.","I feel like a lot of the answers here are missing something key: money doesn't have to come ""from"" anywhere for stocks to go up.  I sell 100 shares of ACME to you for $100 each. You give me $10,000. A little while later I change my mind, but you don't want to sell at $100. So I can only buy 90 shares from you with the $10,000 you gave me ($111.11 / share).  Now I have 90 shares worth a total of $10,000 and you have 10 shares worth a total of $1111.

Some from borrowed money.,"I always wondered how much actual money was spent on a certain market cap of an asset. Like AAPL is 3 Trillion dollars but how much actual money was spent by people to buy ""it"".","The majority of apple shareholders aren't buying or selling daily. Only a small portion of them trade, and ironically move the prices quite a bit.","Worth mentioning that company profit *does* go into the market, for example at Apple‚Äôs latest earnings call they said that ‚ÄúDuring the quarter, we generated nearly $40 billion of operating cash flow, and returned almost $27 billion to our shareholders‚Äù, that is $27 billion used either for dividends or stock buybacks, the latter is a more effective way to return cash to shareholders because (everything else equal) it will increase the stock price, which is not a taxable event for the shareholder.  So *some* of the money in a bull market is company profit.","Money may be held as cash, money may be raised by selling assets like bonds, you can even buy stocks on margin ( borrowed money).¬†   I think it's also important to understand if a companies value increases 1 billion dollars it doesn't mean 1 billion dollars was pumped into the company. Technically not a single dollar has to change hands. All that needs to change is the bid/ask price. In a grossly oversimplified example, if I own all shares of a company and tomorrow I decide that economic conditions have improved and I want to increase the price I would be willing to sell my shares for by 25% then the market value increases 25% even though I might only sell one single share at that price.","Also, for a company‚Äôs valuation to increase, it doesn‚Äôt require an influx of investment - it‚Äôs not a transferred sum of cash. If a company‚Äôs shares are trading at $100/share and then some good news comes out and the next trades are at $150/share, the company‚Äôs valuation has increased 50% but it‚Äôs not like half their book value has been transferred. Just a few trades can change the ‚Äúnotional‚Äù value of the company (the book value plus the discounted future cash flows). A lot of the growth in a bull run is speculative - notional value - which is why it can be so quick to dramatically correct when opinions change.",Look at the volume of shares traded vs shares outstanding,exactly - thats where the question comes from. How much of the market cap is virtual and how much was actually spent when shares were bought.

investing,Mar,1bakgt0,US job market data bolsters Fed's 'no rush' rate cut view,"[https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-gets-another-reason-not-rush-rate-cuts-2024-03-08/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-gets-another-reason-not-rush-rate-cuts-2024-03-08/)  From the article,  U.S. employers added 275,000 jobs last month, a Labor Department report showed on Friday, handily beating the 200,000 that economists expected.  But the report's revisions of prior months' estimates showed smaller job gains in January and December than had earlier been thought, and other details of the report suggested a rebalancing in the labor market continues.  The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 3.9%, its highest in two years, though still below levels the Fed sees as sustainable in the long-run.  And wage growth has continued to edge down, rising 4.3% in February from a year earlier, down from 4.4% in January. Fed policymakers won't see that growth as consistent yet with their 2% inflation goal, but it is moving in the right direction.","Honestly with the economy as strong as it is, there's no reason to cut rates this year.  Why the heck would you cut when things are going so well? You want to cut only if the economy is weakening (which it's not)","One argument for cuts this year is that there is a lag period for the effects of rate changes (I can‚Äôt remember exactly, but broadly it‚Äôs something like 6-12 months).    So if inflation is coming down and unemployment is going up, they might need to cut a little this year to get ahead of those inflation and unemployment trends to make sure they don‚Äôt go too far in the wrong direction. It would look pretty bad if the year ended with 2-3% inflation and falling, 5% unemployment and rising, and a Fed Funds Rate over 5%.","Inflation isn't going down, it's creeping back up in the last two CPI readouts.","This news is somewhat ambiguous; the types of jobs added remain uncertain, and if they predominantly consist of gig jobs, the report may be biased. Rate cuts seem inevitable now, given the achieved inflation rate, the election year, and the current unemployment rate of 3.9, the highest in the last two years.","&gt; the current unemployment rate of 3.9  You need to ask WHY the unemployment rate went up.  If it's ‚Ä¢ because existing workers got laid off, that means one thing; if it's ‚Ä¢ because previously ""not-looking-for-work"" people rejoined the labor force, that means something **completely different**.",It's too volatile to look at individual readouts. How's the moving average looking?,It 100% has. 6-month annualized PCE is basically at target.,"The question is if CPI comes in hotter again, that'd make 3 months in a row. If so, the conversation needs to move back to rate hikes again, which would topple more regional banks. June rate cuts are a fantasy a5 this point",Houses will likely just increase in price accordingly to any cuts.,"&gt; But the report's revisions of prior months' estimates  This happens to prior months _all_ the time.

According to John Bogle's formula of calculating long term prices, a reversion to the mean of Schiller PE 17.10 would be a -50% drop, which of course would be partly countered by earnings growth and inflation. So if we assume a 5% annual earnings growth (including inflation) then stocks might be going almost nowhere in the next decade.

investing,Mar,1b7a8mo,"Why is gold at an all-time high, while gold miners' stocks are at the bottom?","The answer is simple - costs are rising faster than revenue. Let's look at Barrick Gold Corp.:  2016: All-in Sustaining Costs ($/oz) ‚Äì 674, Realized Price ($/oz) ‚Äì 1248. 2023: All-in Sustaining Costs ($/oz) ‚Äì 1335 (approx. x2), Realized Price ($/oz) ‚Äì 1948 (approx. x1.5).  As a result, gold prices increase, but miners' EPS doesn't see the same rise.  However, in the next year or two, the rise in gold prices could accelerate. It's already happening, even though rates have yet to be cut.  We might see a repeat of the 2020-21 story - gold reaching new levels with a sharp increase in free cash flow and EPS for miners.  NEM and GOLD might not be the NVDA or SMCI, but they could double in value.","The other issue with miners is that they do a lot of hedging, so if the price of gold goes up, they don't benefit from it as much as you would expect.","Dollar metrics aside, gold's price is sensitive to political and social turmoil, real or perceived. I attribute some of gold's recent upswing to this.",Down 25% in the last 18 years . . . Nearly 50% since 2011?   That's a lot of chilling.,Same for Bitcoin Miners,You want to see upsidedown?  Check out the price of platinum right now.    It's half of gold while jewelers still charge double.,BTC miners typically underperform pre-halving then outperform after.   Reason being the halving cuts their production in half which creates revenue fears.   But the subsequent supply shock to BTC's price usually creates a rapid margin expansion that catapults their valuation far faster than BTC itself.   It's a fascinating and far more explosive dynamic than GLD/GDX.,Part of the reason it would appear this way is because you need more platinum to make the same piece as a gold one as platinum is denser than gold. Platinum is also a more difficult metal to work with so labor is more expensive. While i also concede that people view it as the more luxurious of the two so jewelers will charge a bigger % markup its not near double the price of the equivalent gold piece.,"So not ""and chill""?","Partially, perhaps. But history shows that a relatively sharp rise in gold to new levels (as often happens at the start of a rate-cutting cycle) significantly increases miners' profits. That is, until inflation erodes them again",certainly correct. A lot of central banks have been increasing their gold reserve

investing,Mar,1b6xq6h,"Can someone explain why it's so difficult to ""beat the market""?","By ""beat the market"", I'm referring to outperforming a benchmark index like the S&amp;P 500 by using a portfolio of single stocks. I've heard various explanations, and even parroted some, but they all seem to be a bit lacking as an actual holistic explanation. Here are some below.  1. ""All of the historical returns of the global stock market come from about 4% of listed companies."" While this is interesting, it's not really an explanation. It doesn't explain why identifying those companies is inherently difficult, just that they are relatively rare. 2.  ""Most hedge funds and other skilled investors don't beat the market"". While I agree this is true, it's simply an observation. There's no explanation. 3. Efficient-market hypothesis. The idea is that asset prices reflect all available information, so every stock is priced perfectly, and therefore alpha doesn't exist. The problem with this is that no one actually believes that markets are perfectly efficient, even EMH proponents will concede this. It's also assumed that smaller, lesser known stocks are priced less efficiently than larger, more known stocks. So even if you believed that the price of say, Apple, was nearly perfectly efficient, there would still be theoretical alpha with smaller stocks.   It seems that most people conclude it's extremely difficult to beat the market based purely on observational data, or because someone they respect said so. Are there any research papers or detailed explanations explaining *why* it's actually so difficult?  &amp;#x200B;","The short answer, if there was an easier way to beat the market we would all already be doing it, which would then likely make it no longer as profitable.

To continually beat this process you need to be consistently beating on winners, whereas the index just absorbs them. If you pick the best stock one year the next it could be the worst, the index doesn't have this problem. There are of course other factors, both financial, statistical and psychological.","Their response still stands, there's a small army of people being paid very well to find every way to beat the market.¬† Unless you're paying them they've probably already found what you found weeks ago (or their algorithms already acted on it before you even saw the news).

Before the Black-Scholes Model was published there was not a standard way to price options, people still did trade options but it was even more chaotic now  However it seems some people did basically figure out option pricing models and they worked very well. These people could then buy underpriced options , sell over priced options and they made very good returns  Way above market returns and they constantly beat the market , but these people kept their mouth shut. They did not tell anyone their model  Then the Black-Scholes Model was published and everyone knew , guess what they couldn't execute their strategy anymore because now all the big players could quickly price an option and mis-priced options became less of a thing and now their competitive edge went away  So like you said , the market isn't 100% efficient, however if you find a inefficiency you can potentially exploit it, but as soon as others realize what you are doing they will do the same thing and the market will become more effecient","Winners stay in the S&amp;P, losers drop out.

In that case you'd have about $2M in today's dollars at age 55. Using a safe withdrawal rate of 3-4% that's $60,000-80,000 of annual retirement income.   Is that enough? Your call. Depends on how you plan to spend your time (Netflix is cheap, international travel less so.). If it's not, plan to either keep contributing or let it ride longer.

Als pay attention to sequence of return risk and the fact that you need to be shifting your asset allocation into safer areas as you get close to retirement, which will drive down your overall returns."
investing,Mar,1bb7qyk,The advice my father told me,"Hello guys sorry if this post is written in a non-compendious and straightforward manner, it is my first post here.  I‚Äôm here to discuss the investing advice I‚Äôve got from my father, whom works in a banking firm as a manager of some sort. I‚Äôm currently in the compulsory national service in my country and am getting around 1k USD each month. I‚Äôve talked with him and his advice boils down to either buying individual stocks that I am confident in / or 50-50 in ETF/index funds such as SPY, QQQ ,and individual stocks like AMZN, MSFT, AMD, TSM.   He did tell me what I should choose from the two should also be determined by my risk appetite, asking if I‚Äôm the type to lose sleep at night if my stocks don‚Äôt well.  I‚Äôm here to discuss with you guys to get some perspective on the advice given and how you look at it. I‚Äôm not here asking on what I should be doing but just here to talk and have others opinions and look at this advice from a bigger perspective.  Thanks for your time and input!","Decent advice. Personally I'd go 90-100% ETFs with no more than 10% for individual stocks I believe in, if any.",I don't bother with individual companies.  They can come in and out of favor quickly.  You can get burned even if you spend a lot of time trying to understand their financials and valuations every year.  Holding a broad index smooths that out.  You only have to worry about saving.,"LOL yes, if you know which stocks are going to outperform the market in the future then you can do better than the market.    So go ahead and tell us, what basket of individual stocks is going to outperform the market over the next 5 years?",This is better advice.    Chances of beating the index is low.  I mean low.  I mean REALLY LOW.  Who cares if YOU believe in stock ABC.  Don't you think thousands of folks believed in every bankrupt company to ever exist?  Yep.  They still failed.    Just put 90% in index funds.  Then up to 10% in whatever else you want.  Won't matter as it is just gambling and that 10% is likely to underperform anyways.,"Wait you actually listened to advice from your dad enough to transcribe it here? Can I trade you for my kids?  It was good advice. Never mind people saying that since you are young you have time to recover and can take more risk because of it. Thinking like that will mean that during this ""recovery"" you will be in catchup mode and will need to again take on more risk and the cycle will repeat itself.  Starting young and being conservative will produce the best long term result for the vast majority of investors, and the results are as close to certain as can be. Compounding is your BFF at your age.  Best advice from Buffet for you:  ""never lose money""",Sounds like a Dad that learned from his own mistakes and is passing on wisdom,Index funds are great as they don't pick stocks.  That is the point.  They just just pick all stocks that fit their methodology.  For example if you choose the U.S. total stock market it will pick EVERY U.S. stock that is investable minus the very smallest stocks (-3% or so of the smallest one out there that are too small for it to invest).  They don't choose.  The invest in a market cap fashion.  They weigh them accordingly by market cap meaning more shares of stocks that are bigger and less in companies that are smaller.  So you are gauranteed to get the return of stock market.  If it gets +20% you get +20% minus fees.  If it gets -20% you get \_20% minus fees.  That is fair.  That is it.  The point is to avoid active investing which is defined as:  Security selection and market timing.  There are landmark articles (nearly no one knows they exist including the financial pros on Reddit as I have had numerous discussion about this topic which is UBER sad considering they do this for a living) that have decided this debate many years ago.  BHB and BSB papers were published years ago showing active management LOSES you money vs. passive index investing.  No surprise Wall Street makes sure the main street never learns about those studies.,Hindsight is always perfect,And what if you bought into Enron or Cisco at the peak of the hype?  It's easy to look back and cherry-pick.  What companies are going to deliver in the next 10 years?,"I would say what he taught you is probably a conservative approach that would warrant some reasonable return in the long run. I would assume you‚Äôre at a young age given that you‚Äôre currently serving the military. I think one of the great benefits of being young is you have a lot of oppt to take risks. And in the financial market, the higher the return the higher the risk. No pain no gain, just my two cents"
investing,Mar,1bk5ud0,I have been contributing to something I'm unsure about for the last 3 years.,"My friend, a legitimate licensed financial advisor, initially presented this opportunity to me, and at the time, I had no reason to suspect any foul play or deceptive practices. He framed it as a retirement account or something akin to a post-tax 401(k). Three years ago, I enrolled and committed to contributing $120 per month, totaling $4,320 over this period.  When I access the account online, it indicates a balance termed 'life paid at 99,' which I'm unsure about‚Äîcould this be related to life insurance? Additionally, there's an option to cash out at $1,300, indicating a loss of $3,000 if I choose this route. My original friend who introduced me to this opportunity no longer works there, and I'm now dealing with a new financial advisor.  Given this context, does it sound like a life insurance policy? Can I halt contributions and wait several years before cashing out to at least break even? I can provide further details if necessary.  Upon reaching out to my former advisor, Rob, for clarification, I asked whether it's worthwhile for me to maintain this arrangement. I mentioned my account's current balance of $1,200 despite having contributed $4,200.  Rob's response was: ""Yes, it is worth maintaining because it's designed for retirement. With the current balance of $1,200, future interest will be based on that amount, and this will compound over time. The figures I previously showed you, which you found appealing, represent guaranteed numbers. Moreover, this investment will prove useful and necessary when you eventually start a family. Essentially, you've taken an early initiative that will be advantageous in the long run.""  Given this information, what exactly am I contributing to?

Buy run-down buildings that are, in New York lingo, rent-stabilized. Fix them up. Pass along the expense to tenants by raising rents, which was allowed under the regulations. Cash out. Repeat. Once rents approached $2,800 a month, owners could charge what the market would bear, and the apartments became a potential gold mine. ‚ÄúYou just had to be patient,‚Äù Peterson says. But his bet on raising rents has gone disastrously bad, as it has for landlords across the city. In 2019, alarmed about the decline in affordable housing, New York state lawmakers rewrote the rules. In one key change they sharply reduced how much landlords could raise rents after renovations. In an even more important shift, the apartments no longer leave the program when rents rise high enough. Peterson‚Äîwho‚Äôs bought more than 40 properties for $300 million over 20 years‚Äîis now in distress. He‚Äôs falling behind on his mortgages and scrambling to find money for repairs. In October, Fannie Mae, the government-backed home loan company, started foreclosure proceedings against a dozen of his properties, including the building on 164th Street. ‚ÄúMy career is over,‚Äù Peterson says. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs just a question of: What‚Äôs my legacy going to be? Is it going to be that I abandoned the ship when it was sinking, or that I stayed and fought?‚Äù Last year, New York buildings with at least one rent-¬≠stabilized apartment sold on average for $203,000 a unit, down 34% since 2019, according to Maverick Real Estate Partners, a New York investment manager. By contrast, the price of nonregulated apartments rose 23%. The value of rent-stabilized units declined by as much as $75 billion, Maverick found. In December the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. unloaded $15 billion in loans backed primarily by New York rent-stabilized apartments‚Äîat a 40% discount. Last week, amid concern over real estate exposure, shares of New York Community Bancorp Inc.‚Äîwhich holds about $37 billion in apartment loans, half backed by rent-regulated units‚Äîdropped 38% in a single day. ‚ÄúA lot of owners I‚Äôm speaking with want to walk away from buildings,‚Äù says Lazer Sternhell, chief executive officer of Cignature Realty Associates Inc. in the city.","Typically /r/investing ""it's priced in!"".

investing,Mar,1bd1e1i,How does an ETF like VTI handle a stock like NVDA?,"My understanding is that an ETF like VTI is market cap weighted, so when you have a stock like NVDA that is very rapidly increasing in market cap, how often is something like VTI adding more 'shares' of NVDA to their underlying asset  portfolio. I don't even know if that's how it works to be honest... But for a stock like NVDA which is up 100% over the past 6 months, if a fund only 'rebalances' periodically, does that mean you are missing a significant chunk of that rapid gain on the way up? Just trying to understand how it works.","Here's the math behind it:  You have 2 stocks in an index, A and B. Company A has 100 shares outstanding at $30 each, for a market cap of $3,000. Company B has 500 shares outstanding at $14 each, for a market cap of $7,000. 30% of the etf will be A and 70% will be B.  The etf buys 1 share of A and 5 shares of B. The etf is now worth $100.  Company A triples in value. It now has a market cap of $9,000. The total market cap of the etf is $16,000 (7000+9000), so company A should be 56.25% of the etf if it is market weighted.  Since the A share tripled in value, it is worth $90. The 5 B shares are still worth $14 each, or $70 total. The etf is worth $160. $90/$160 is 56.25%. No rebalancing is necessary.",They don't have to do anything.  That is the efficient genius of market cap weighting.    If NVDA market cap is increasing due to stock price increasing then its share of VTI is also increasing due to the same stock price increasing.  Outside of user inflows/outflows an index fund like VOO/VTI only has to buy or sell when there is a change in the index NOT due to changing prices: * a company issues new shares and thus raises its market cap even with zero change in price * a company buys for cash (not stock) another member of the index * a company spins off a company and due to its size the spin off is not a part of the index * a merger of companies which is not 100% stock * a merger of a company which is part of the index to another not part of the index,"I was going to say, this seems like a trickier problem for something like RSP (equal weight S&amp;P)",This is the explanation I needed. Thank you,Think about it.   The ETF is market cap weighted.   A stock in the index has a higher market cap due to its price increasing.   The ETF owns the stock whose market cap has been changed due to market action.   What trade needs to happen for the ETF to retain its market weighting?,"Ah, this explains to me why Marketcap weighted ETFs are so much cheaper than Revenue-weighted ETFs (0.09 vs 0.39).  It's so simple, but I didn't even think about it.","In theory it sells winners and buys losers, which is a good strategy when the market is random walking.  In practice MANGA or whatever we're calling it now has such outsize influence it's underperformed VTI.","Most funds actually own shares of the company.  They will buy 1 million NVIDIA shares for example  If NVIDIA shares increase in price by 100% guess what, their shares they already own will increase in price by 100% too. They do not need to buy more shares. The shares they already own have increased in value   With market weighted funds changes to share price does not cause the need to rebalance . Other things like new stock issuance or potentially share buy backs might .  With equal weighted funds like RSP however this might happen, as NVDA rises they will need to keep selling some to keep shares in equal weights. However most rebalance on a set schedule not daily . I think RSP rebalances quarterly so its not having to constantly buy/sell every day",I imagine it'd get rebalanced every once in awhile.,It‚Äôs a self correcting problem.
investing,Mar,1bq0vza,what will happen if the fed didnt cut the interests rates?,"i read on reuters  that The Fed is close to delivering a rare soft landing for the U.S. economy but it faces yet another fraught challenge: reducing cash in the financial system without disrupting markets.   With the Fed having already removed some $1.4 trillion as it shrinks its balance sheet to end pandemic-era support, the focus is increasingly turning to when it should stop. The worry is if cash in the banking system, called reserves, breach a certain minimum level, markets would freeze up. But no one knows what the right level is.  &amp;#x200B;  i was reading at CNBC  according to Steven Blitz,  if the Federal Reserve chooses not to cut interest rates this year the stocks will march higher so  investors should not worry ,do you agree with this statement or no.","Honestly expect they will do 1 or 0 cuts,  if inflation keeps being over 2% there is 0 reasons to cut it","Yeah, I think we probably stopped raising rates too soon and cutting would be a mistake. I don't know fuck about shit, though.",I don't understand why people are second guessing the fed. They tell everyone what they are doing and why on a regular basis. They say over and over that they are data driven and will act accordingly. That's what they are going to do. Is it going to be 1 rate cut or 5 this year will completely depend on the CPI and PCE.,"They have said over and over they will cut before it hits 2% or they‚Äôll overshoot it. When rates are on the way down they will cut so that it hits 2% , if they wait until it‚Äôs already 2% to cut their policy will lag and it‚Äôll likely go lower than it needs to and they don‚Äôt want that either.","oh, mate! reminds me of the time i bet on horse races knowing zilch about horses. ended up picking a winner based solely on its funky name - ""glittering unicorn"". sometimes ignorance is bliss, eh?","The reason the initial rate hikes were bad for assets prices is because the market never really priced in long term inflation, they bought the transitory story, and just priced in a hawkish fed. The yield curve inverted and asset prices fell as deflationary recession fears were priced in. The fear was that the fed was overly tight.  At this point if rates aren't going to be cut, its going to be because of a resurgence in inflation, and this could mean that the opposite could happen, inflation expectations rise as the market realizes the fed isn't as in control, the fed is feared to be doing or have too little of an effect. So the yield curve may un-invert by long term rates going upward, which would hurt bonds even more, but stocks and other real assets may actually benefit as an inflation haven.  It depends on economic growth though, stocks would probably still fall in an inflationary recession, where both growth slows and rates/inflation rise.","Where is this recession everyone speaks of? You mean the 3.4% revised growth this morning? The low unemployment, low mortgage delinquency rate? Are you sure these high rates are killing the economy? Cause it don't look like it.","What's uncertain about high rates? If they're high, they're high. Investors know what to expect.","&gt; 2% or they‚Äôll overshoot it.  And yet, they've said (not recently, maybe their opinion -has- changed) that the negative consequences of overshooting the goal are still FAR less than from undershooting it and cutting too soon.  That's the thing -- it's not an exact science, y'know?","it always delayed, by the time they cut rates every analyst will say in hindsight we should have cut rates 6 months ago. I think it can be 0-2 cuts this year. most likely 1 cut."

investing,Mar,1bglp5z,My moms 401k and retirement ,So my mom is like 4 or 5 years away from retirement. Her 401k person has her money in a very low risk option so it is hardly growing if at all. Right now she only has about 170k.   Should I tell her to get her advisor to put her full amount or a lot of it into voo or a different S&amp;P 500 etf? Or is it too late to do any real good? I think she‚Äôs a little iffy on telling someone who knows what they‚Äôre doing what to do. I think she told me a while back she got fucked back in the day with Enron so she‚Äôs just dug her head in the sand and let the people who run it just do what they do.  Thanks for any help or advice you guys got.,You're her retirement. Congrats on being promoted.,"Retirement is not an age, it‚Äôs a financial status.  $170k will yield about $6,800/year.

She can retire when her income from investments and social security match her projected expenses. Including projected medical expenses and end of life care.

investing,Mar,1bfhdrf,Roth IRA hasn't grown much.. are my asset allocations sub-optimal?,"I'm late 20s with a steady job. I invested $6k into a Roth IRA 2ish years ago, and haven't looked at it much since. Today I went to check on it. I have 72% FSKAX and 28% FTIHX. Since then, with all of the ups and downs I have only made $443 in gains. Does this seem low? I am wondering if my asset allocations are the issue here, as I was expecting to see a little more in my overall gains.   I am wondering if I should change my asset allocations to include bonds as well, because Fidelity says I am using a ""Most aggressive"" strategy, and I see a lot of people suggest to include bonds (FXNAX) as well as you get older. I was thinking of changing my asset allocation to 60 FSKAX / 30 FTIHX / 10 FXNAX.  Is my current asset allocation the issue here? It's hard for me to tell if I am ""doing well"" or not, but I may just be too new at this.","2 years is never an appropriate timeframe to judge stock market returns, let‚Äôs start there.   But your asset allocation is fine: 72% total us stock market, 28% total international stock market. Now the only thing to do is sit back and watch (and contribute more regularly).",No bonds or cash is why fidelity says that.,"Switching to bonds would reduce your returns, not increase them.   Your allocation is fine you just invested once so of course it‚Äôs not going to grow that much. You should contribute regularly up to the max for the most benefit.","$443 on $6k is 7.3%, not a terrible return over two years.  As many have noted, the market has been down big and then back up during that time. If you‚Äôd checked your portfolio any time between April 2022 and last November, your gain would have been negative (ie a loss).¬†  The thing about an aggressive allocation is that in the short run it‚Äôll move up and down a lot. There‚Äôs no investment guaranteed to make you a lot of money in the short run. But the expectation is that if you tolerate the volatility, you‚Äôll do well in the long run.",most aggressive probably because it's 100% equities. If you had some allocation in bonds then it would be less aggressive but it would reduce the potential for growth as well. As someone else said you said you invested 2 years ago which I'd assume was beginning to mid 2022. If you look at the s&amp;P 500 over 2022 you basically invested at a high and then immediately suffered losses and the gain you see now is your portfolio recovering from that. You say you have a steady job so I'd suggest continually investing maybe every month so in the event a similar market event happens you'd be covered because you'd be buying during the low period as well.,You should definitely be doing it every year. Just dump 7k in every January or $583 every month. You are doing yourself a huge disservice if you don't.,"There is no definitive rule - lots of guidelines, but everyone has their own takes on them.  A lot of it has to do with risk tolerance and your timeline.    One option is to take a look at a target date fund (given your age, 2065 is a good date) and see what their split between equities and bonds is. That's a decent starting point.",Everyone's allocation is sub-optimal with hindsight.,Just looks like OP bought the peak in 2021 so this seems right,"Do you know if there is there a reason Fidelity says I am ""most aggressive"" with this strategy? Just trying to understand what resources to trust."

investing,Mar,1bcfgb1,Technical Analysis seems to be nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy ,"Now, I‚Äôm not trying to start a war because I know some people love to dive in deep into technical analysis. However, in my opinion it‚Äôs nothing more than a self fulfilling prophecy and it only works because everyone uses it. It‚Äôs all kind of a trick. For example, sometimes there is no good logical reason why stock will go down. It‚Äôs all simply because people observed some pattern on the chart and suddenly everyone starts selling and the domino effect goes on and on with no fundamental changes from the actual company. Thus, very often the stock price goes down BECAUSE of technical analysis, but not because technical analysis predicted it. Does anyone else notice this?",You just explained the psychology behind technical analysis.,"Technical analysis is just stock market astrology.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Libra right? I can tell because you‚Äôre patient, curious but also unsatisfied‚Äù. / ‚ÄúNope I‚Äôm actually a Taurus‚Äù. / ‚ÄúI actually knew it because you‚Äôre cunning and humorous‚Äù.   It‚Äôs exactly the same as ‚Äúthis was a bear trap double upside down V so it‚Äôs going to drop‚Äù. / *stock price goes up* / ‚Äúwe saw this as a cup shaped false triangle climb‚Äù.  Give me a break","Technical analysis doesn‚Äôt predict anything. Those that believe that it does do not know what technical analysis is.  Yes, some aspects of TA can become self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, institutions often put buy orders at the 50-day simple moving average, and it is no coincidence that stocks in uptrends tend to find support near that level on pullbacks.  However, TA is nothing more than a mathematical model of price/volume that can be used to assess supply/demand and provide an edge. It predicts nothing, but it can help determine the probability of one thing happening vs. another. This is because human psychology never changes. The market cycles between greed and fear and everything in between. Similar patterns occur over and over because humans (and the algorithms they program) act the same way over and over. Chart patterns simply provide a framework for decision making, by identifying balance and imbalance between buyers and sellers in a stock.  Those who dismiss TA should also dismiss other disciplines where mathematical models are used for statistical analysis.","My friend countered, ‚Äúso what, the bottom line speaks the loudest. Who cares if we trigger the break out.

The creator himself said it may have worked back in the good old days when trading was simpler and less participated but by modern times (mid-late 1900s) it was useless. Feel free to be mad, facts don't care","‚ÄúA mathematical model ‚Ä¶ that can be used to provide an edge‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt predicts nothing‚Äù  These two claims are contradictory. A model with no predictive power cannot be used to provide an edge.  It‚Äôs pretty clear that you‚Äôre just throwing out terms without understanding them. A statistical model is used to make inferences. Meaning, it can be used on unseen data and generate a statistical distribution. Using inference on unlabeled data is called prediction. Only predictive models can provide an edge. Models which do not generalize to unseen data does nothing for you.","&gt;And for me, it provides an edge in trading.  It makes you *feel* as if you have an edge. But it actually doesn‚Äôt.",Technical analysis can be useful for entries after researching a company. It can be helpful for establishing rules for when to buy/sell an asset. That's how many PMs use it.,"But you only make money if you sell. But if anyone sells, the stock goes down again.

I am not predicting that something will happen, only that it has a higher probability of happening than the opposite.  Yes, this is called making a prediction. You are claiming that the model predicts that something will happen with a higher likelihood. That's all a prediction is.  The problem with TA is that this prediction power is completely bogus. If this predictive ability is actually demonstrable, you can prove it mathematically by building the model and running it on real data. But the model is bogus and no one has ever been able to demonstrate that anything TA predicts has higher probability of success."
investing,Mar,1be46r2,Seeing an accelerating amount of layoff announcements lately,"Has anyone else been seeing an acceleration in the amount of announced lay-offs recently? It appears to be reaching far beyond the tech sector also. This is purely anecdotal, but on a daily basis I search layoffs, sorted by the past 24 hours, and see multiple large announcements every single day. Seeing as these are public announcements via WARN notices, I'm sure there is also an acceleration of layoffs in small business that isn't as visible.   Just a partial list from the past 24 hours:   \-IBM  \-Grossmont Union High School  \-Jacobz Technology (240)  Black and Decker (200)  Rooster Teeth Productions (100+)  Stash (80)  Niche (7% of staff)  John Deere (150)  Hamburg Central School District  Highmark Insurance (108)  Sunrise Coal (118)  Johnson and Johnson (55)  Blue Diamond Growers (38)  Prima Wawona (5000)  UL Solutions  These are all layoffs that have been announced in the past 24 hours. Not yet in the data. Day after day I see announcements like this with increasing frequency. With the recent slight uptick in unemployment to 3.9%, it will be important to see if this trend continues. The Sahm rule (0.27% currently) increased toward its threshold 0.5% but is still below its October high of 0.33%. The recent downtrend in the number was broken by the February jobs report. Of course, several more months of data will be important to determine if it will begin to trend up.   Just curious to hear everyone's thoughts on the job market and if they have seen an increase in layoffs in their area. Companies appear to have gotten comfortable with layoffs and are being rewarded with higher share prices for doing so. Layoffs tend to accelerate at a rapid pace once they take hold.   &amp;#x200B;",Anecdotes chasing data.  https://www.bls.gov/jlt/  JOLTS still shows historically low labor turnover.

Most bond maturities happen every 2-5 years.

If the debt burden on your balance sheet suddenly doubles, triples, or quadruples, you need to start major cuts. Employees are the biggest expense a company has.   There has never been a rate hiking cycle involving higher inflation and tighter lending where we avoided recession. It has never happened.   The last and most painful leg of a recession is when unemployment spikes. It is coming. Get ready.",All the layoffs you posted are negligibly small though other than the 5000.,"Markets usually bottom about 3-6 months after interest rate cuts start. This is because the fed cuts when poor economic conditions or credit events force them to. Rate cuts are reactionary, and the events that follow usually go something like this:  As rates fall, the value of bonds goes higher. This draws in liquidity from risk assets and creates downward price pressure on markets as institutional money tries to secure a good long-term yield on rapidly rising bond prices. This downward price pressure on risk assets is exacerbated by rising unemployment, as household spending and balance sheets contract when wages are lost. Consumer spending is negatively affected, which leads to smaller profit margins, which leads to worse quarterly performance, which leads to less speculative volume in the markets overall. Credit defaults and bankruptcies are usually at the tail end of this deflationary cycle and force capitulation.",Bad news sells. Media reports when individual companies layoff employees. Media rarely reports when individual companies hire employees.,"Rather than believing anecdotes, just look at the JOLTS Layoffs numbers.  TLDR: Layoffs are still historically low and not reallt rising to any degree",I feel like we have seen so many layoff announcements but the job numbers don‚Äôt seem to reflect it. Nothing makes a lot of sense right now!,I believe jobs report showed that the higher education professionals are losing jobs but this is balanced out with growth in high school grad type jobs.  Clearly the job market is not in favor of white collar professionals at the moment but the economy overall can do well despite this.¬†  So it doesn‚Äôt necessarily bode recession or anything.,"I would look to the more holistic job market. Its possible tech and some other sectors over-hired during the pandemic years and now need to adjust, but the larger economy seems to be doing really well and hiring very consistently. Every months has great job creation numbers.  Unpopular opinion that I'm sure my perspective will change on once I finally experience this hardship, but layoffs are not totally a bad thing for companies! Especially larger ones with so many layers of bureaucracy.   A lot of work is pretty fluid in how much someone is doing actually benefits the company, especially when we're talking about white collar work, and a lot of people manage to find little niches where they are happily employed and don't contribute much to the company's profitability. And I'm not blaming anyone for not working hard enough either, a lot of times it's not their fault! Entire divisions and ways of working might go unchecked for years, people told they are doing a fine job, but then one day a part of management wakes up and realizes we don't need to employ Windows Server 2003 server administrators anymore, or whatever.  I'll say I'm not a fan of certain companies who have GM-style annual layoffs to cut this sort of fat, since it makes things too systematic, and you end up losing good people for a pretty asinine reason. But companies need to be willing to cut fat sometimes, largely layoffs are a lot less personal and tamper the blow a bit versus firing people outright. Bad analogy incoming: its kind of like ghosting versus a face-to-face break-up.","Thank you for this excellent breakdown. It feels like it's been coming for a while but I've just never taken the time to re-learn this stuff since high school, and seeing markets hit ATH's day after day with AI as the ""tailwind"" (which sounds suspiciously like a bubble) makes me nervous about investing more than a thousand or two now while I'm about to move and likely need a new job."

investing,Mar,1b3ri8k,Explain the math to me regarding investing vs pay off debt. ,"A car loan of 20k for 60 months at 7%. Interest is $3761.44.  If I put 20k in a 5% HYSA , compound interest over 60 months comes out to $25,525.63. obviously a gain of over 5k.  I hear people say all the time  that if the debt interest rate % is higher, it makes sense to pay if off first . Obviously there's income tax with a HYSA but I feel like I'm missing something.   Could anyone elaborate why it's better to pay off debt in this scenario?","Because in the case of this loan, you are paying it off during the 60 months else you would pay more interest, so you can't keep the money in a HYSA at the same time.  If you have a line of credit at 7% and you don't pay anything during that period, your debt is 28051$ after five years, while the same money you put in a HYSA at 5% only grew to 25526$",You're missing that the interest on the loan decreases as the balance goes down over the course of the loan. That's why 7% interest on the loan is less interest than 5% interest on the HYSA.   To make it apples to apples compare saving the loan payment in the HYSA over the same perod of time.   You are indeed paying 7% on the loan and earning 5% less your tax rate on the HYSA so you'll come out around 3% behind on the loan.,Oh be quiet. He asked a genuine question. Don't be a grumpy pants ffs,"This is the explanation I was looking for.  I plugged the monthly payment I would have otherwise payed into a compound interest calculator and it came out to $26,930.41. So yes paying off debt early is better in this scenario. Thanks","**Unpopular opinion:**  For many people- especially those who do not have extreme discipline- you‚Äôre better off paying the debt first.  ___________  Yes, you can make more investing than the debt on your loan.  But that assumes you‚Äôll actually invest it all.  Many people see money ‚Äúsitting there‚Äù in an investment and spend it.  Now they have a loan and no money.  For instance, we understand why soneone wouldn‚Äôt want to pay down a 100,000 mortgage at 3%.  You can make 7% or more by putting it in the S&amp;P index fund.  But most people won‚Äôt let 100,000 ride in the S&amp;P for many years.  After a year or so, they‚Äôll pull it out and buy a new boat or something.  _____________  Emotion is a powerful thing for most people.  Having your debts paid off simply makes you fEEL more powerful and you make better financial decisions.  For instance, I started my own business.  I wouldn‚Äôt have done that if I was burdened by high mortgage, car loans, student debt, etc.  since much of my debt was paid off, I felt powerful enough to make the calculated risk.",There are only tax benefits to a mortgage beyond the standard deduction. For much of America you‚Äôre getting zero tax benefit from your mortgage.,&gt; 7% vs 5%  Since you have to pay the interest rate monthly you wont be able to compound the money in the 5% savings account by the interest rate amount.,"Everybody thinks they can become a bank and arbitrage their debts. Unless you have a Covid-subsidized 2% rate it's doubtful you come out ahead. You have (probably) one source of income that can end at any moment, just pay your shit off.","Normally this applies to home loans because there are tax advantages, the sum is so large that the rate really matters and it's extremely competitive.   When home loans are in the 5% range, and the market is returning 9% and you get other tax advantages, it's better to invest than pay off the loan.  But if you have some high interest rate loan like on a car, it's better to get rid of that immediately as you will never beat those rates (fairly safely), especially over the short term (0-5 years).    These are rules of thumb, but this is a bad rule of thumb because it requires knowledge and investing experience.  If you can't figure it out on your own, then likely you aren't going to figure out the return on an investment over X years either or get the numbers correct.  A rule of thumb is so people can avoid getting into the details very deeply.  It's a good starting point for many things, but in this case, it's probably too complex for the majority of people and ripe for abuse by others.

investing,Mar,1br2kat,Collaboration Alert: MSFT and OpenAI Launch $100 Billion Supercomputer Venture,"ARTICLE TLDR: Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on a massive data-center project estimated to cost up to $100 billion. The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates.

investing,Mar,1b6xl9c,How much is too much for my kid's 529?,My 12 y/O's 529 has a balance of $160k right now. I'm currently maxing out the IRS annual limit per year ($36k; $18k from me and $18k from my spouse). I should end the year around $190k. Realistically I can afford to cash flow a decent chunk of their college when the time comes but I like the idea of making my money work harder until then. I'd love to be able to fully cover their costs but I'm worried about over funding it at the same time. Interested in feedback on how I might think about this.,How much do you anticipate their college tuition to cost? 160k is a very significant amount,"Many here will say you‚Äôre ridiculous for investing a large sum into ‚Äúkids 529‚Äù yet they are wrong. Overfunding the 529 is a strategy very savvy investors will utilize to a) eliminate taxes b) move money out of their estate c) maintain full access, liquidity and control of their money. Similar to a ROTH, your money grows tax free in perpetuity. Withdrawals for education, room, board, tuition and miscellaneous costs are all tax free. You can switch the beneficiary among family, to yourself, and across generations. You can also convert excess 529 balances to Roth after 10 years. Lastly, and this is key, you can avoid the 10% pro rata penalty if the beneficiaries is impacted by a) death b) disability c) scholarship. In summary, overfund the 529 because you never lose control of the money, the kid has no claims, you direct all distributions, and your can recycle money back to yourself if any money is left over. The 529 is one of the most under appreciated investment accounts in existence and education inflation exceeds even healthcare costs. Remember, it‚Äôs your money, not your kids, and you have no obligation to use the money for education, yet the privilege to spend it tax free if you chose to.","$400k in 2030 for one child is a good amount to have. Even if it is not used entirely by your child, the leftover may be used towards your grandchildren education.",I assume 4 yrs at a good (read: expensive) school will run me $400k+ in 2030. I also assume my kids won't qualify for any needs based financial aid given our current income/assets (we are very fortunate) so basically I'm just balancing my savings plan against the likelihood of them getting some money due to academics or sports scholarships. Upside is I can somewhat de-risk my savings bet by putting money away for them in a Roth IRA from the 529 (thanks to the Secure 2.0 law) but certainly not a majority of the dollars saved.,They also recently passed a bill letting you roll the balance into the child's IRA once they turn 30.,"Great reply, others than the details on the Roth - up to 35k, subject to the annual limit, after 15 years, but not within 5.",529 to Roth IRA is capped at $35K per person.,"As someone who went to a top private school, in retrospect I would have just gone to a good in-state public school and basically gotten the same quality of education.",400k is insane.

Thanks in advance,High yield savings account (4.0-4.5%) or government securities money market fund like SNSXX (4.30%-5.0%).

It‚Äôs 35% FXAIX (S&amp;P 500 index), 16% FSSNX (small cap index), 16% FSMDX (mid cap index), 18% FSPSX (international index), and 15% FIPDX (bond index).

Technically you get more risk adjusted returns with like 10% bonds in a portfolio that is rebalanced occasionally. Thats it.

investing,Mar,1bnepu4,Question about the movie Margin Call,"I rewatched Margin Call over the weekend and I love the movie, but I'm always confused about something. They spend a good chunk of the movie arguing over whether they should sell off all their MBS positions like it's a big moral quandary because they believe the housing market is about to crash, but isn't that the whole basis of trading and investing? I think it will go down but you think it will go up, so let's trade? Like if I had stock in a company and I look at their financial state and decide they're going to go bankrupt in the next week, how is it unethical to try and unload the stock?  The firm in the movie wasn't using insider information, they were doing based on their own risk projections and trending data. And it's not even like they were unloading it on some hapless schmuck who doesn't know any better, they were selling to other investing firms who absolutely have the knowledge and expertise to reach the same conclusion Zachary Quinto did. They even imply that none of the traders will be able to get jobs in the industry after that, but I can't believe that every trader who correctly predicts that things are about to go bust gets blacklisted. What am I not understanding?",They are not selling to random schmucks.  They are selling to people they have long standing relationships of trust.  Spacey is worried about the losses the buyers will suffer. It is left unsaid but Irons is not concerned because he knows those buyers won't be around in the future.,We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price,"If you sell a worthless asset to someone, why would they ever buy anything from you again? It's not rocket science",Yeah they're setting the incentives super high for that reason as well. They know if they don't pay these guys a golden parachute there is a risk that they would be more incentivized to keep their contacts within the industry and not do as good a job selling.  If you do it you're essentially working your last day at your company and that your industry and job experience will be completely useless by tomorrow.  If you don't do it then maybe one of your friends at the contra firm would still appreciate you and offer you a job opportunity down the road.   They're being paid a premium to burn all their bridges.,"It‚Äôs far more complicated than that. Public companies are required to ‚Äúmark to market‚Äù. Basically, if you buy a stock that trades daily, you have to keep track of its current value if you decide to sell. They were invested in MBS which had no market, so assets were held at cost (the last known transaction). If they move forward with a sale, at a 90% loss (or whatever it was), they have to report it and EVERY FIRM that owns MBS has a new market price and has to mark down their assets.  Now banks have additional requirements that they have a certain amount of assets they can sell to meet liquidity needs (customer bank account withdrawals). Suddenly a large chunk of bank assets (MBS) take a huge loss. Banks then will not have the assets to meet deposits, customers then find this out and run on the bank because it‚Äôs first come first serve when banks collapse, until the FDIC can make people whole.   Banks stop lending because they can‚Äôt take additional liabilities until they raise capital. Companies regularly use short term loans (days to weeks long) to meet payroll obligations but without banks willing to even make these loans, companies were on the verge of missing payroll payments and bond payments, meaning they were facing bankruptcy.  The implication of selling their MBS at a huge loss would mean triggering a financial crisis and they knew it. But not selling almost certainly would expose them legally because they didn‚Äôt put their own shareholders interests first. That was the dilemma.","&gt; They even imply that none of the traders will be able to get jobs in the industry after that, but I can't believe that every trader who correctly predicts that things are about to go bust gets blacklisted.  It's not about the prediction, it's about the sale and leveraging their industry contacts to dump the poison.  The crux of the moral quandary is presented in the montage scene of Paul Bettany calling all of his ""business friends"" one after another to sell off. ""Hi, how's the kids, how's the wife? We're doing some spring cleaning and I have a _great deal_ and since I've known you so long I'm coming to you first"" and he says ""I've come to you first"" to like his first three sales. It's about lies. It's about having to lie to make the sale, because if they were honest no one would buy them.  The traders that get a big bonus for meeting the sale target aren't going to be blacklisted just for being involved in the sale. They're going to be blacklisted because every bank that survives is going to remember ""Oh, John Smith from RandomBank? That asshole sold us $300 million of MBS at 10:00 AM that one time that RandomBank was firesale-ing and it was down 50% by market close. John Smith can go fuck himself.""","But that‚Äôs the driving force behind the movie. This firm is the first to see it coming and it‚Äôs inevitable but not immediate. They can save their own ass (to an extant) by lighting the fuse and kicking everything off, but they‚Äôre going to essentially destroy anyone they sell off to (including Kevin Spacey‚Äôs sons firm if you didn‚Äôt catch that little bit in the closing scene).",Basically at that point they believe those assets are basically worthless but the rest of the world doesn't know yet.

There's not enough demand to buy them all in one year at the market prices, so the whole district is guaranteed to drop in value. So I want to sell them ASAP before the guaranteed drop hits.  When I'm the first to start the firesale, I get the best price while everyone else is left holding the bag. That's not going to make me any friends, but it gets me out of the trouble.

investing,Mar,1bffne0,China Urges EV Makers to Buy Local Chips as US Clash Deepens,"What implications do you think will have for US and EU semiconductor manufacturers? Any insights how much substitution Chinese chipmakers can actually realistically achieve? (I was under the impression they wouldn't be able to but perhaps things have changed).  China Urges EV Makers to Buy Local Chips as US Clash Deepens  - Directive could hurt Nvidia, NXP and other EV chip suppliers - Order is a response to US efforts to curb Chinese chip tech  The Chinese government has quietly asked electric-vehicle makers from BYD Co. to Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. to sharply increase their purchases from local auto chipmakers, part of a campaign to reduce reliance on Western imports and boost China‚Äôs domestic semiconductor industry.  The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology asked carmakers this year to expand their buying of homegrown components to accelerate the adoption of Chinese chips, according to people familiar with the matter. The country‚Äôs tech overseer previously set an informal target for automakers to source a fifth their chips locally by 2025, but has grown dissatisfied with the pace of progress, the people said.  The ministry is now directly instructing firms to avoid foreign semiconductors if at all possible, said the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing sensitive information. That means overseas chip firms effectively have to manufacture their silicon through a local foundry such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. or Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd., one of the people said. During a recent tender conducted by a major domestic brand, one foreign bidder failed to secure a contract despite offering a price they estimated was 30% lower than the eventual winner, another person said.  The developments reflect Beijing‚Äôs stepped-up efforts to galvanize its own tech sector, a response to US attempts to curtail Chinese chip development via sanctions and restrictions on the sale of advanced technology. The Chinese directive on cars casts uncertainty over the business of companies from Nvidia Corp. and NXP Semiconductor NV to Renesas Electronics Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., which compete with local firms to supply the world‚Äôs largest EV market.  Shares in European chipmakers that supply Chinese EV firms fell in early European trading. Infineon Technologies AG slid as much as 4.8%, while STMicroelectronics NV slid 2.2%.  Many local brands buy a hodge-podge of other components from power management chips to microcontrollers and display ICs. Some carmakers from leader BYD to upstarts like Nio Inc. rely on Nvidia processors for instance to coordinate functions in their hyper-connected cars.  The MIIT didn‚Äôt respond to a faxed request for comment. BYD, Nio and Geely representatives didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.  Beijing is increasingly intent on supporting a domestic chip industry it knows is lagging well behind foreign rivals, but critical to supporting the economy and maintaining a geopolitical advantage. The directive is in line with pledges this year to mobilize all means at its disposal to wrest technological supremacy from the US and other nations.  The central government may also be bracing for curbs in the auto sector specifically.  Washington is probing potential data and cyber-security risks posed by internet-connected cars from China, including EVs. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has expressed concern that data collected by the cars could wind up in Beijing‚Äôs hands, and is overseeing an investigation that could result in restrictions on the sale of those cars in the US ‚Äî measures that would go beyond a potential increase in tariffs.  A mandate in favor of Chinese chips also raises the prospect of further retaliation as Washington ramps up its containment campaign.  At the Two Sessions meeting of lawmakers this month, Beijing hammered home a longstanding goal to break an American stranglehold on key spheres. Under Xi Jinping‚Äôs watch, China has expanded state control of strategically critical areas from semiconductor manufacturing to quantum computing.  Against that backdrop, Beijing has endorsed the efforts of local champions such as Huawei Technologies Co. through subsidies and targeted policies. It‚Äôs now establishing a $27 billion-plus fund to drive chip investments and hiking spending on nationwide research to more than $51 billion.  China‚Äôs biggest auto chip and software providers include Huawei, Loongson Technology Corp., GigaDevice Semiconductor Inc. and Wingtech Technology Co. Many, like Novosense Microelectronics Co. and StarPower Semiconductor Ltd., have built significant capacity in so-called mature or lower-end nodes. The MIIT‚Äôs policy may soak up some of that capacity ‚Äî at the expense of their foreign rivals.  The US and its European allies, meanwhile, have grown alarmed by China‚Äôs rush into older-generation chips. The Biden administration is mulling tariffs on those components in addition to other trade tools, but has said it is not considering restricting them using export controls.  While US rules introduced in 2022 slowed China‚Äôs development of advanced chipmaking capabilities, they left largely untouched the country‚Äôs ability to use techniques older than 14-nanometers. That has led Chinese firms to construct new plants faster than anywhere else in the world. They are forecast to build 26 fabs through 2026 that use 200-millimeter and 300-mm wafers, according to data from the trade group SEMI as of 2023. That compares with 16 fabs for the Americas.",More of the same. US semi companies are already reducing sales to China because of US pressure. That's it.,"I don't think you need 3nm chips for cars if that's what you were referring to, I believe China's chip makers are very capable at producing what their cars need","You can look at my comment/submission history, this is my bread and butter.   &gt;What implications do you think will this have for US and EU semiconductor manufacturers?¬†  Not a huge amount. Qualcomm and NVIDIA are both sort of at risk of losing nascent markets, but I don't ultimately expect it to mean much. Most of automotive inherently relies on larger (cheaper, older) nodes where China excels and EU suppliers have already domesticated their manufacturing in China so the shift here isn't tectonic.   &gt;Any insights how much substitution Chinese chipmakers can actually realistically achieve?¬†  Enough. Look into Huawei's AITO as a full ""China Stack"" option quickly gaining speed over there. But the automotive industry is far too complex to unravel in the span of a year or even a few years, with several layers of co-owned subsidiaries co-owning other subsidiaries across international lines. Full separation is basically impossible.","Kinda. There's no JV mandate when it comes to suppliers, so many EU suppliers are structured around having CN branches, like Bosch. They might source CN chips, but also source EU chips because, well, they haven't really been concerned about country-of-origin when it comes to chips, just cost.   I'd say it's more of a US-China problem, yeah, but I still don't think the effect here is going to be huge. The power of these Chinese 'directives' are generally overstated in western media ‚Äî¬†OEMs will look up from their work, say ""okay whatever"", shake hands with the politicians, and go back to doing whatever they were doing before.   There's a larger phenomenon of Chinese OEMs getting good at semiconductors and partnering with Chinese semiconductor firms, but that's just a thing that was already happening in a wider environment of a growing industry seeking stability, independence, and domestic strength. Even international OEMs have been doing it *within* China ‚Äî¬†look at [Volkswagen and Horizon](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-take-60-stake-tech-joint-venture-with-chinas-horizon-robotics-2022-10-13/), for instance.","But beyond that, are the Chinese actually able to substitute what they import from the US and Europe? My understanding is that they were nowhere near able to do so a few years ago, and considering the increased demand for chips because of electrification going forward (even with them expanding domestic capacity), I imagine they would be unlikely to be able to do so in the future either.","Very good news for the US. Indicates China is shifting away from a plan to invade and conquer Taiwan in the near future. As the US ramps up their own chip production, Taiwan will lose significance as the nearly sole provider of US military semiconductors and the likelihood of China-US war will continue to fall.","Right, so you would say the Chinese semiconductor ""substitution"" trend is effectively also taking place via the joint ventures / fabs that (notably) EU semiconductor firms are current building with Chinese companies, so really it's more of a US-China industry problem than a China-EU one?",&gt;What do you think of China‚Äôs EV ambitions?  What about them?,Oh my bad. EUV. That was what I meant to say.,"""I was under the impression they wouldn't be able to but perhaps things have changed""  Depends what chips you're talking about. They aren't as advanced as the latest stuff, but there's a lot of RISC-V chips (the open chip architecture) that can run Linux now. And you can't ban RISC-V.  But this is all a gift to Chinese chip makers. If US chips are banned, or companies in China are nervous about more chips being banned, they're going to invest in ensuring supply."

Don‚Äôt.,Keeping a huge emergency fund now when interest rates are sky high is a lot more acceptable than when they were basically zero for a decade,"I didn't really understand interest rates and how much cheaper it made monthly mortgage payments in the COVID era.  All I could see is, $370K for a house? That's crazy.  I wasn't educated enough to understand 370K @ 2.75% is cheaper than 300k @ 5%.  So, I could have bought a house down the street in a neighborhood I really liked.  Things worked out okay though.  In terms of stocks, I've done well mostly just buying passive index funds.  I tried a few meme stocks at small amounts (Helios and Matthewson, Palantir, Canopy) and they all went kaput.  It's not just about the risk, its about the worrying.  It's not worth it.  Hindsight is 20-20 but when I first started working in 2016 and investing, I wish I understood just how much runway I had to see equities grow.  I was only 24 and FAGMAN stocks were there and profitable at the time, I wish I had pulled the trigger.  I arguably played it too safe by just buying S&amp;P500.  Which in a way is a roundabout way of owning them anyway.  I also did get some Microsoft and Facebook at the time, which I'm happy about.",Maxing my 401k for years.

investing,Mar,1bmk1h7,Capital gains without selling?,"Relatively inexperienced but started investing 2 years ago.   I bought ETFs and mutual funds and have reinvested the dividends and just have let it sit.   However, I noticed that I‚Äôve got long term capital gains implications despite not selling these investments.   Can someone explain how this happens and maybe how to avoid? Does it have to do with whether the fund manager sells off parts of the mutual fund? Thanks!",Can happen if the underlying fund assets were sold for a gain by the manager,"It‚Äôs not a return of capital, it‚Äôs a capital gain distribution. Very different tax implications between the two.",Mutual funds (especially the actively managed kind) can distribute capital gains.  Index ETFs tend to be more efficient this way.,Mutual funds will often do a ‚Äúreturn of capital‚Äù at the end of the year.,"Dividends are not capital gains. However, if you meet the requirements to receive qualified dividend income (QDI) they will be taxed at capital gain rates","Or if underlyings were acquired. Say you owned Twitter - the fund has no choice but to realize a cap gain when it was acquired, and will distribute the proceeds.","ETFs can have dividends.  Even if you choose to reinvest them, you're still receiving them first.  That's capital gains.  Mutual funds can have dividends as well, and they also can have capital gains distributions.  Same deal there -- you can reinvest them, but you're still receiving them and incurring the capital gains hit anyway.  On the plus side, your dividends and capital gains distributions are reinvested at a (hopefully) higher cost basis, which means when you end up selling those reinvested dividend shares, the capital gains hit will be less in the future.","You need to be a little more specific.   &gt; However, I noticed that I‚Äôve got long term capital gains implications despite not selling these investments.   What ""implications"" are you talking about? Are you sure you're reading the statement correctly? Are these LTCG you're talking about *realized* or *unrealized*?","Some funds have to sell assets here and there depending on outflows. That causes a capital gains distribution to the other fund holders. Some funds are structured such that this does t happen, like VTSAX.",This is why ETFs are preferred in taxable accounts.   Mutual funds are fine in tax advantages accounts for this reason.
investing,Mar,1b6i0yw,What happens to a 401k if the investor passes away before retirement age?,"Assuming the investor in a 401k has assigned beneficiaries, what happens to the funds if they pass away before retirement age?  Context: My health has not been good in years. I have built up a substantial savings in my retirement fund. If I were to pass before retirement age, would my beneficiary (wife) be able to access the funds? Or must she wait until she reaches retirement age?","Your wife would have a choice:  1. Roll the money into her own retirement accounts, then treat it like her own. This would imply not being able to access it before retirement age. 2. Roll it into an Inherited IRA, which would require withdrawal over 10 years. The withdrawals would be taxable income (assuming your 401k is pretax) but there would be no penalty regardless of her age.  If she didn't need the money right away she should do #1. If she did, she should do #2. Either way it would be good to have a plan in place.",I believe the new 10 year rule only applies to nok spouse beneficiaries.,"The 10 year rule is *mandatory* for non-spouse beneficiaries yes (unless you meet certain special criteria).  Spouses can opt out of it. But note that opting out of it requires moving the money into your own IRAs, where it is subject to the same rules your own retirement accounts are, i.e. being subject to early withdrawal penalties.  What a spouse cannot do is move it into an inherited IRA, withdraw without penalty, *and* avoid the 10-year rule.  [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-beneficiary](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-beneficiary)  &amp;#x200B;  \*(The 10 year rule can also be changed to a life expectancy based schedule).","The 401(k) doesn‚Äôt stop being a 401(k) upon inheritance, and a spouse is the default beneficiary whether explicitly designated or not.  There are unique rules for spouses to avoid the usual 10% penalty for early withdrawals. See this article:  https://meetbeagle.com/resources/post/what-are-401k-beneficiary-rules-for-the-surviving-spouse#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20the%20beneficiary,inherited%20401(k)%20money.",A will doesn't help here.  A will would only apply if the 401(k) passes to the estate which is catastrophically bad idea.   While the OP should have a will the will shouldn't be used for a 401(k) the beneficiaries should be named directly in the 401(k) and as such the 401(k) never goes to the estate and thus the will never applies (wills only cover distribution of assets from the estate).,"I‚Äôm sorry about your health, OP. Mortality and decline is an unfathomable burden to live with. May you be surprised by your number of happy years to come.",First I assume your 401(k) is pre-tax (trad) and not Roth.  Rules for Roth are a bit different.  A spouse is a special case.  They have the option to assume the account which means the funds stay in the 401(k) follow all normal 401(k) rules and just the name changes on it from you to your spouse.  In most cases this is the best option because even if she needs some of the funds immediately she won't need to cash it all out.  Once she assumes the 401(k) she could roll it over without taxes to a trad (pre-tax) IRA.  Any distributions from it would be taxed as regular income.  If the distributions are made prior to age 59.5 then there is a 10% penalty unless an exception like a 72(t) SEPP applies.  Essentially this is no different than if the 401(k) was always in her name from day one.   https://www.investopedia.com/inherited-401-k-rules-to-follow-5425958  There are other options available in the link above but in most cases it is best to take the spousal assumption.  Note this option is ONLY available to spouses.  Anyone other beneficiaries would have to take one of the other options.,Early withdrawal penalties do not apply to inherited IRAs. The 10 year rule forces all non spouses to empty the account within 10 years regardless of age.   Unless it goes to a spouse. Then they can opt to roll it into their own IRA where the regular rules apply (including the 10% withdrawal penalty).,Write a will and the money can pass as you see it. You can also set beneficiaries on the account. Best for you to consult an estate planner.   I wish you good health.,"Jesus they're making it more and more clear as mud as time goes on.  I had to deal with a non-spouse inherited 401k right after the 10 year rule came into effect and things were already looking messy (looking at you, IRS, for taking 2 plus years for rulemaking on RMDs....)"

Go to /r/personalfinance and /r/financialindependence to learn about IRA, 401k and other stuff.","Check out the sub resources, lots of good basic advice there. You‚Äôre on the right track starting young and with VOO in a Roth IRA.","An IRA is an Individual Retirement Account, which is a type of tax advantaged account and not a specific type of investment. There are two types of IRAs, traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. With traditional IRAs, any funds you contribute are able to be deducted on your taxes, and you pay income taxes on it when you withdraw. You don't pay capital gains taxes on any growth. This makes it advantageous to invest in an IRA versus a regular brokerage account, in which you pay income taxes and capital gains tax.   A Roth IRA is similar, except you are not able to deduct the contributions from your taxes now. However, you do not pay any taxes when you withdraw, and similarly you do not pay any capital gains tax. Whether a Roth or traditional IRA is best depends on your income and tax situation. If you expect your taxes in retirement to be lower, then a traditional IRA is better. If you expect them to be higher, then a Roth is better. But both are better than a regular brokerage account.   *Within* an IRA, you can invest in just about anything. VOO is a specific investment fund, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF. This tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index of the top 500 publicly owned companies in America. This is a common recommendation because this is a good way to get broad exposure to the overall market without paying many fees. There are many other things you can invest in, but something like VOO is a good recommendation for a novice investor.","I started with Dave Ramsey‚Äôs total money make over (awesome starting point, great for eliminating debt, easy to follow, but not great for investing) then ready bogleheads, and then four pillars of investing. The latter 2 are a lot better specifically for investing.   At the end of the day you need to educate yourself. Start with more ‚Äúbeginner friendly‚Äù books and build on that.

I‚Äôm getting an 8000 paycheck tomorrow what should I do with it?","It's good you're already investing but like the other commenter said, how come you don't have any tax advantaged accounts? Always invest in those first before taxable accounts, especially if you're investing in broad market index funds.","If you're getting $8000 paychecks twice a month, you're likely beyond the contribution limits for a Roth IRA.

I didn't, and I regret it greatly. I'm currently ""retired,"" but I still have a bit of a side hassle that I use to fund my Roth now. But I really should have had a lot more stacked away beforehand... playing catch up is such a pain.","Ok I'll assume you're maxing out your 401k (don't see a reason why you're not at your income level).    Which means at this point you should probably look into backdoor ROTHs and see if you want to deal with the extra step you have to take. If you don't, using your taxable sounds ok to me.","There is a hard limit.  $23,000 for 2024","I think the place to worry about it is like $150k income single, or $240k income married filing jointly.    I think the ""normal"" thing would be to have your brokerage and your IRA from the same broker.  Once a year, transfer the max IRA contribution  from the brokerage to the IRA.  Easy peasy.  $7k this year, $8k if over 50.  Then you can buy whatever in the IRA.  Know the limits imposed on you by an IRA though -- you're earmarking the money for retirement, so it might be harder to access before age 59.5.  Though with Roth IRAs, I think the contributions are technically accessible any time, and only the gains are gated behind age.  But in exchange for the limitations, you no longer pay capital gains on realized gains in your IRA.","Investing in VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF) through an individual brokerage account and a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA) shows a balanced approach between equity investments and saving with a relatively safer, interest-earning account. Your strategy reflects a mix of growth (through VTI) and stability (via HYSA), which is a solid foundation for most investors.  **Regarding IRA vs. Individual Brokerage for VTI:**  * **Tax Advantages:** An IRA, whether it's a Traditional or Roth, offers significant tax advantages. A Traditional IRA may provide you with a tax deduction on contributions and tax-deferred growth, meaning you don't pay taxes on dividends, interest, or capital gains until you withdraw the money in retirement. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. * **Contribution Limits:** Remember that IRAs have annual contribution limits. For 2023, the limit is $6,000, or $7,000 if you're 50 or older. If you're used to investing $2,000 monthly ($24,000 annually) between VTI and HYSA, you'll still need your brokerage account to invest the excess. * **Investment Options:** Both IRAs and brokerage accounts offer the ability to invest in VTI. The main difference is the tax treatment of your investments and withdrawals. * **Withdrawal Rules:** IRA accounts have rules regarding withdrawals. With a Traditional IRA, withdrawals before age 59¬Ω may be subject to taxes and penalties, with some exceptions. Roth IRAs allow you to withdraw contributions (but not earnings) tax- and penalty-free at any time, but earnings are subject to similar age and holding period requirements as the Traditional IRA for tax-free withdrawals.  Given your current investment in VTI and the balance in HYSA, your strategy seems sound, providing both growth potential and a safety net. Regarding the $8,000 paycheck:  * **Emergency Fund:** Ensure your emergency fund is robust enough to cover 3-6 months of expenses. If your HYSA serves as this fund and you feel it's adequately funded, you might look beyond this. * **IRA Contributions:** If you haven't maxed out your IRA contributions for the year and are interested in the tax advantages, consider contributing to an IRA. * **Diversification:** Look at your overall investment portfolio to assess diversification. If it's heavily weighted in U.S. stocks via VTI, consider diversifying into other asset classes or international investments. * **Debt Repayment:** If you have any high-interest debt, consider using part of the paycheck to reduce or eliminate this debt. * **Investing in Yourself:** Opportunities for personal or professional development can also be a valuable investment.  It's always wise to consider your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon when making these decisions. If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.",I have a 401k and a pension,"Go to /r/personalfinance and read their wiki.

investing,Apr,1c3y3ff,"10 years ago, we discussed how we select stocks. Here's the 2024 version.","Hi /r/investing, roughly 10 years ago there was a great discussion about [how we select our stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ecl4v/how_do_you_search_and_find_good_stocks/).  I discussed my method - Trending Value - and that led to me sharing my results with many of you via a program I had written.  Well, that program broke and remained dormant for years... until now.  So what is Trending Value?  It's a method published by James O'Shaughnessey in his ""What Works on Wall Street"" book. During decades of backtesting, it generated over 21% annual returns with equal standard deviation to the total market.  It generated a lot of discussion and lead to [this follow-up thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eyx3r/how_do_you_select_stocks_contd_trending_value_see/). In my mind, this method resonates the truest... far truer than those who advocate watching the check-out lines at your grocery store to see which products are being purchased. The method, summarizing is the following:  When you run a screen for stocks with good P/E or P/B, what do you look for? You find a stock with a P/E multiple of 12. Is this good? Is this bad? Neither and both, without a frame of reference. O'Shaughnessey's method rates 6 key financial metrics for every stock against the whole market to come up with a cumulative VALUE BASED score. Those metrics are: P/E, P/B, P/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, and Shareholder Yield, which is dividend yield + stock buyback yield (i.e. equity returned to the shareholder in some way).  All 6 metrics are ranked 0-100, where 100 is the ""best"" ratio in the stock universe, and 0 is the worst. The top 10% of stocks will typically have scores in the 420+ range. They are undervalued relative to the rest of the market.  However, just because a stock is undervalued DOES NOT mean that it's a good buy. It could be facing legal action, failing drug trials, having a CEO that just went to jail, or other event that can't be reflected in these numbers. That's where momentum comes into play.  We take the top decile of stocks and reorder them by 6-month price momentum. Invest equally in the top 25, hold for a year, liquidate, repeat. The companies you buy are undervalued and the market is rallying behind them. Back testing, while not a prediction of future results, yielded a 21.2% average ROI with this method.  Of course, there's no screener that does this, nor is there a way to even view ""Shareholder Yield"" in one location.  When I started this 10 years back, I used MatLab to solve this problem.  Yes, MatLab.  Wrong tool for the job.  Thankfully, ChatGPT has turned even amateur hobbyist coders into useful contributors, and a python version has been born.  I'll post the results of today's run below.  Feel free to ask for a specific stock and I'll post the results of that ticker.  Keep in mind, it is filtered to Market Cap &gt; $200M and the name of the method is Trending VALUE - your growth stocks (NVDA, TSLA, etc) are going to be viewed very poorly.",Ticker Symbol: BMA 	P/E:

If the macro environment has a median P/E of 40, it is scored well.

My parents taught me by investing a very small amount of money for me in a mutual fund when I was 7 years old.  I had been so busy with life and all of its demands that I had not paid any attention to the mutual fund.  The information on it just went straight into a folder, I literally didn‚Äôt even look at the statements.  It kind of annoyed me honestly because it was set for dividend reinvesting and each year I had to pay additional taxes on the income as a result.  Then one day I had some time to go through my files and clean them up a bit.  I pulled the file folder out with all the statements and looked back through the entire history of the account.

investing,Apr,1bty4ku,AI will ruin entire investing strategies.,"**Context:**   In 1998 the SEC authorized electronic exchanges; at that exact moment high frequency/algorithmic trading was born. This completely changed traditional trading forever as everyone here knows.         Everyone here who is doing TA is effectively competing against hedge funds / trading firms *(cough Jane Street, Renaissance, etc)* that hired former MIT math Olympiads to deploy quant models to pattern recognize better than any simple bot you'll find on GitHub can.          This is obvious. I'm not making this post to talk about chart analysis, but rather I think we're going to see a similar shift happen that we saw in 1998 and it will happen that impacts the traditional financial markets. The first firms to benefit from high frequency trading, algorithmic trading bots, and quantitative models had a disproportionate advantage over the general population. Advancements in neural networks are about to make the gap wider than we've ever seen it.  &amp;#x200B;  **So what's the advancement?**  It's not one. It's several.   &amp;#x200B;  1- ***The prerequisites:*** The major breakthroughs we're about to see are already here, although in a rudimentary state. Those were simply some of the current quantitative models that exist as well as the advancements we've seen in transformer architecture, and as a consequence, language models. Most people I talk to about GPT still don't seem to get it. It scales with compute and there's emergent properties that are completely unexplainable by the researchers that built it. Namely, sentiment analysis was not something these models were trained for but became world class at - more on this later.  &amp;#x200B;  2 - ***Universal*** ***Aggregator:*** The second is pairing a language model with an advanced search engine. The *PayPal Mafia* quietly took a bet on an AI lab that isn't OpenAI. It's [**called Mindy**](https://Mindy.com). Yu Pan, a co-founder of PayPal and Employee #1 at YouTube cofounded an AI lab backed by Peter Thiel (former CEO of PayPal) and Roelof Botha (former CFO of PayPal). Effectively, the AI is like if ChatGPT and Google had a baby. It's an AI you just email and it has indexed the entire Internet and can answer any question about anything. To give an example that would be relevant to this subreddit, it can give you specific financials on stocks/10ks/etc instead of doing manual research. It's being used by anyone from retail traders to private equity firms already. Admittedly, I currently use this to expedite my DD - and of course, this can be extrapolated to any area of research. But the reason why a tool like this is interesting is because you could hypothetically aggregate all past data with the same underlying technology, which brings me to my third point.  &amp;#x200B;  3 - ***Modeling the entire stock market:*** No longer will hedge funds be using pure mathematical models for trading with some macro-trends factored in. They will be making their own AI models on the history of the entire stock market using the aforementioned systems. This isn't just quantitative price fluctuations. Firms will create entirely new models where they scrape every piece of news associated with a specific stock, index, and the global economy and perform sentiment analysis on the exact news released on that historical day and tie its sentiment to the exact stock price on that historical day. This allows them to create an entirely wholistic picture of what has occurred in the stock market, and as a consequence, draw future correlations. Does it account for black swans? No. Will it predict our extremely unpredictable market system with complete accuracy? No, but even the most chaotic system must generate alignments; it's the same reason a broken clock is right twice a day. This allows them to look at areas of highly probable winning trades in niche areas of the market that their new model found. This isn't just a matter of markets becoming efficient and competing firms keeping up either, because the firms that win have increasingly more data (and more capital) to put into compute for their models.  &amp;#x200B;  **Conclusion**   To be clear, this does not already exist but all of these advancements are building up to this exact system, and the first group of investors to do it will become unbelievably wealthy. Firms are working on this, so just know when you're tinkering with TA concepts on trading view, the big players are becoming disproportionately more advanced and your models are decaying in efficiency exponentially. This will know exactly when to ""Buy the rumor and sell the news"". One can even imagine such a system being able to incorporate something as detailed as C suite profiles into their predictions.   &amp;#x200B;  **TL;DR:** Be extremely cautious with short term trading of any kind, even if you're decent at it now - you might not be in 6 months - and it's for very different reasons than people would have said in the past. We're about to witness more advanced analysis than we've ever seen.","lol, I work at a bulge bracket on WS and this is the dream of what our bank wants to do with trading strats. So this was pretty funny to read. To be fair, I already don't think your average part time day trader has a great chance if they're trying to do basic TA. You're competing with people that do this for a living. But yes, you're right it's going to get far more sophisticated but the systems will eventually even themselves out amongst the major players.          Fundamental analysis is where this changes things. I think people will just create models to try and emulate successful investment strategies (eg buffet) at an extremely quick rate.         My take: The little guy was already screwed if he was half assing trading anyways. AI will change fundamental analysis overall and help people rapidly find the best opportunities. You can have an LLM churn through thousands of financial reports in minutes, synthesize the results, and match investment criteria better than a human can. BUT things could get very weird in a few years if one firm develops a model sophisticated enough that it basically just wins every trade, and causes a ""singularity"" like event in the stock market - but this remains to be seen. I've heard several quant types mention this, but it's out of my realm of expertise.","Sorry but AI will never read the stars and coffee stains like I do, nice try Big Broker","I wrote a similar post in the past, but took it down and rewrote this to be more detailed. I'm not sure if anyone will read this but these are just some observations I've made.   AI is something that will be used by all of us to expedite basic research. If you're doing conventional investing, use the tools I mentioned or ***something*** in AI to benefit your DD. If you're doing short term trading, realize that the game is about to get a lot more intense. You're ultimately competing with the big boys.","LOL, wtf are you talking about?

That's not how this works...  &gt; OMG why do you hate yellow cars?  This is usually how these dividend conversations go.  There's nothing particularly wrong with dividends, but there's nothing particularly right with them either.  Focusing on them like they're something important to seek out is demonstrating a lack of understanding.  And no, $5-10k is nowhere near enough to cover necessities, at least in the United States.","And, amazingly, you don't have to invest only in one thing!  I hold both volatile growth prospect and mature/stable dividend companies as investments. Shocker!","I'll add that a whole lot of people just. don't. get. it.  The dividends sub is full of people that freak out about the idea of selling their principle, as if generating 4% dividends and no growth is somehow this completely different thing than having your principle grow by 4% and then selling the gain.  You can explain to them that well, those actually work out to be exactly the same thing, and they'll go ""But in the growth case I now have fewer shares and I'll eventually run out of them"". And you'll say no, that's not how it works and the number of shares is irrelevant, all that actually matters is the total dollar value of your portfolio. And then they'll either say something else inane because they don't understand math or they'll just turn to insults.  I eventually had to unsubscribe because (at least last I looked) it had been completely taken over by the True Believers.","Dividends companies also signal that they are at their maturity and aren't going to be making risky plays for insane attempts at growth. I think the fact that the last 20 - 30 years there has been tech boom makes people undervalue the idea that some companies hit a point where they say ""he, we're in a good place. We're gonna optimize, and keep ourselves going and pay out dividends"".   Financially, obviously dividends payments take out a sum out of the company's worth, but general companies that enter dividends should be in a place where their valuation is more stable over time.

investing,Apr,1bxj51l,Why the fuck is Edward Thorp so underrated ?,"The man literally invented quantitative trading and developed a model similar to Black-Scholes, which he kept to himself, 6 YEARS before Fischer Black and Myron Scholes.  He was among the first to invest in Citadel after meeting Ken Griffin.   Thorp proved that it's possible to win at blackjack by inventing card counting, prompting casinos worldwide to change their rules.  I feel like everyone talks about Warren Buffett, Jim Simons, etc., but I've never heard anyone say, 'My favorite figure in investing is Ed Thorp.'""     TLDR: Just an ode for all the Ed Thorp stans","He's the goat, but the reason why hes not popular is because the things which make himt he goat are not reproducable by the average man.   He was a mathematical genius and applied his genius to multiple different fields to create models which won him the games.   They aren't comprehendable by laymen in the way that just ""investing in good businesses"" is.",Warren Buffet exudes a simple charisma and midwestern charm. He‚Äôs great in interviews and always has some folksy quote. That‚Äôs a big part of the reason the average person likes him.,"Probably because he doesn't like fundamental investing:       &gt; _""My attraction to fundamental analysis weakened further as practical difficulties appeared. It is almost impossible to estimate earnings for more than a year or two in the future. And this was not the least difficulty. After purchasing an undervalued stock it is essential that others make similar calculations so that they will either purchase or wish to purchase it, driving its price higher. Many ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù stocks remain bargains for years, frustrating an owner who may have made a correct and ingenious calculation of the future prospects.""_","Oh Ed Thorp is legindary , he beat the market consitantly for like 18 years. For 18 years his fund returned on average like 22% or something , like over 2x the S&amp;P500 for 18 years. Thats almost impossible be he did it.  However he did it by developing a math model that was better then anyone elses , after the black-scholes model was realised everyone else knew how to properly price options and he did not have an edge  I guess its probably because you can read about warren buffett strategy and understand it, hell you can even use it yourself and its still relevant today  Well I am just not smart enough to develop a math model that would be superior to the current models , like its an interesting read but 100% amazing its just does not really help the average investor to learn about it because the average investor is not going to develop some new model on trading.  Understanding value investing is much easier then understanding the fine details of option pricing models",Warren became far richer and directly owned companies employing hundreds of thousands.

The employer contribution is a separate bucket",Well unless your company fails the non-discrimination test. Than your max could be a lot less‚Ä¶ My reality every single year.,There‚Äôs an annual limit to how much you can contribute to a 401k,"People here talk about the $23k limit. But if you can, and if your plan offers it, you can make after tax contributions to an additional $46k for a total of 69k via what's known as a mega backdoor roth.¬†   don't forget you can also do an IRA on top of that for a $6500 annual limit, also via backdoor roth if you are over the income limit.","Glad you pointed this out for some to learn from. The first year or two I maxed out I did the math to account for my employer‚Äôs contribution, not realizing that it didn‚Äôt affect the max I could contribute.","Your 401k has a contribution cap, for 2024 that is $23,000. Once you hit that cap you won‚Äôt be able to contribute anymore - in theory you could set your contributions to 100% if you wanted (there may be complications if you have other paycheck deductions that you don‚Äôt have enough leftover for).","Why is this comment so heavily downvoted? The HCE nondiscrimination test is a real thing (https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/401k-plan-fix-it-guide-the-plan-failed-the-401k-adp-and-acp-nondiscrimination-tests). Most big companies use a safe-harbor 401k plan to get around this issue, but many small companies don't opt for the safe-harbor plans and your plan can be hit with a violation that effectively reduces your max contribution limit.",I believe in 2024 the new IRA limit is 7000,"I use to work for a retirement account company.  I‚Äôve actually seen some small companies fail testing and even though the clients didn‚Äôt reach their max contributions, they‚Äôd have to get their contributions back.  It was really sad to figure that out and difficult to try to explain to some people.    I will never forget this caller name Juan (not real name) that he called asking why we sent him a check of $7000 when it was suppose to go to his retirement account.  I told him his 401K failed an IRS test and to speak to his HR department.  He called the next day really discouraged and asked if he can take all his money out.  I had to explain to him he couldn‚Äôt take his money out since he is active with his company.  Turns out he was one of 3 employees contributing to the retirement account out of 40 employees.  And if the rest of the employees didn‚Äôt contribute, he‚Äôd keep getting these checks every year.  That basically meant no saving for retirement."

investing,Apr,1c5q6sa,Building generational wealth without beating the market,"Hey folks, sorry for a bit of a ramble, but I was doing some math on investing and kinda wanted my work checked.   Assuming a 6 percent interested rate, it takes 7.2k dollars a year(600 dollars a month or 20 dollars a day) to save up 1 million dollars, assuming all dividends are reinvested.   Assuming you invest this million dollars in a responsible manner at a 6 percent rate, you get 60k a year forever.   Or, you can live off 30k a year (+social security and other saved money), and reinvest the other 30k. The value of the nest egg will double every 23.45 years. (This is the doubling time for 3 percent interest).   Assuming you only have 2 kids and you have them after the age of 24, you can pass each of them a nest egg of at least a million if you live until 80, if you include the value of your house. If your kids or your spouse contribute too, it only grows. (Inheritance Taxes kind of break this. Any way around it?).   There is no tax on long term capital gains in the USA if your yearly income is less than 44k a year, interestingly.  I'm currently 23, have been investing for about 4 years, and have 65k saved up, almost all in s&amp;p 500. This is in addition to my 401k. This puts me 3 years ahead of my plan.   The easiest way for me to cut my living expenses by 600 dollars a month was to get a roommate in a cheap 2 bed apartment instead of having my own nice 1 bedroom apartment. I really doubt that there are many Americans above the poverty line who are incapable of making some kind of cost cutting to save an extra 20 dollars a day. It surprises me that so few people have retirement savings.","An analysis like yours is what keeps the luxary cars business aflout. You need to consider opportunity costs and regret when doing a very austere long-term planning. Otherwise, you might find yourself realizing that you've spend your irreversible youth saving money for time when your taste buds are dying to fast that the restaurant finesse is no longer appealing. Any investment strategy needs to find the proper balance between saving a lot of money and spending everything on hookers and blow.","Your head is in the right spot.  You probably want to account for inflation (bad), and raises (good), and the fact that two kids are going to make living on 30k a year near impossible (but kids are great so still good).  But, directionally, you are 100% right.  Even people on normal salaries can get rich if they start investing at 23 and keep it up until they are 65.  The problem is that the snowball only really gets rolling at the end, so a lot of people give up along the way before.  I hope you don't.  Good luck.","Also, never underestimate the depth of crisises or their frequency. Your analysis assumes that a person can live his live while being insured, for free (possible, by some kind god), from everything bad, like a combo of being fired, having sick kids that require meds and care, being emotionally and financially wrecked and not being able to find a job, starting to drink as a sleep medicine (as doctors are expensive) and ending up behind Wendy's.  This is why I don't judge people that ""failed"" to make it. Tail risk is a female dog.

No paper.,They should be able to deliver it via email. Companies are required to send you a notice though.,Who is your brokerage ? Mine are all by email,I stopped receiving snail mail documents about a decade ago. Now it is all electronic. I guess it depends on the broker?,Your brokerage should allow you to elect electronic delivery. A large number of my investments switched a few years back and required me to opt in if I want mailed documents now.,"Same here. The only time I got anything other than an email about a vote was when someone from MCD's called to lobby me for my vote against one of the items on their ballot.

investing,Apr,1bwfzp0,Where does the compounding come from in the S&amp;P500?,"Talk to me about the nuts and bolts of compounding in the S&amp;P500.   I understand compound *interest*, but investing in the S&amp;P500 doesn't yield any interest? It does pay dividends, but that is \~1.5%, which obviously doesn't account for the annual average of \~7% return.   So where does the compounding come from - growth in share price, only?   If it is growth, and that growth is eventually exponential, then doesn't that mean that the average company in the S&amp;P is also experiencing exponential growth? and is obviously unsustainable.    Any gains are only realised when sold, and THEN potentially reinvested.   So where does the compounding happen? What returns are being reinvested to give the compounding?   Do all flavour S&amp;P500 ETF's operate this compounding the same way (assuming you manually reinvest returns from DIST funds, ACC takes care of itself).   My logic must be broken somewhere...   Talk to me Goose.","You don‚Äôt need re-investment for compounding. It‚Äôs just a concept. A company‚Äôs value grows 10% one year and 10% the second year. The growth in the second year is also growing the growth from the first year - compounding growth.  Example: a company experiencing 10% annual appreciation has a share price of 100 and it goes to 110 after year 1. What happens after year 2, 3, and 4 - does it go to 120, 130, 140? No, it goes to 121, 133, 146 because each year the 10% is being applied to the new value from the prior year - compounding growth.","&gt;The source of growth of the markets is inflation, population growth, and increases in efficiency/productivity.  This is missing a very significant component of growth: reinvestment of capital. Most companies are able to make money. They deliver value back to shareholders via either dividends, buybacks, or reinvestment of capital for growth. This is arguably the most important component.",I was assuming it was a rhetorical question.,If I make 7% this year. And I make 7% next year did I make 14% or more than 14%?,"Yes that applies to the stock returns of an individual company but I am talking about the growth of the entire market over the long term. When a company makes more revenue, generally speaking, it is either because they are siphoning revenue away from their competitors (no net market revenue growth), they have found a way to improve productivity or lower costs (efficiency increases), the price of goods is going up (inflation), or there are more consumers to sell to (population increase). Long term growth of the market is due to those last three. Share buyback delivers investment returns but not market growth - it converts company cash reserves, profits, or debt to equity, and tends to increase share price by reducing share supply, so it will deliver returns to investors, but is not a net increase in global revenue which is the primary driver or market growth.","Say a stock is worth 100$. If you make 7% compound interest yearly wou'll have:  Year 1: 100+100\*0,07 =107  Year 2: 107+107\*0,07=114,49  As you can see you made 14,49%, not 14%.     If you do this for 10 years you'll make 96,71% not 70%, that's 26,71% more.","I dunno what you're trying to say here. If a company makes a billion dollars then reinvests this million dollars on capex, to hire more people, to make even more money in the future, that's still compounding.","With interest rates, compounding is how is actually works. With stock returns, compounding is just a way to describe it in a way that's comparable to things that return interest.","TL;DR:  The difference between getting an annual raise, or just getting a bonus",&gt;What returns are being reinvested to give the compounding?  The earnings that each company makes.

investing,Apr,1cdxp4x,Does everyone hate financial advisors?,"For transparency I work in the industry and I am just wondering in this day and age of robo-advising and ETFs, does everyone hate financial advisors now?   And this question may not be for a lot of you that are truly investment savvy of course, but this isn‚Äôt the 1970s-1980s anymore and regulations are through the ceiling. A lot of financial advisors simply just want to do their job and try to assist people who may want or need it. A lot of advisors truly aren‚Äôt out to rip people off, companies just have to charge costs to keep the business running of course.   Are there fees with management yes? But there‚Äôs fees to pretty much any business being done in life, so legit question is why do people expect to be helped and have free management? I get if you can do it yourself that‚Äôs fine, but everyone isn‚Äôt an investment savant, and that‚Äôs not to say all advisors are either, but they are at least licensed and held to a fiduciary standard.   Some people may still want that financial planner who can not only deal with their investments but provide advice and options for lending, banking, tax efficiency etc. typically those who do their own investments think it‚Äôs as simple as ‚Äúbuy this etf and hold etf‚Äù but everyone‚Äôs situation is different in multiple ways. I once had someone ask me to invest their 74 year old friend into the QQQ because ‚Äúthey heard it has AI and is doing well‚Äù. But her 74 year old friend was highly conservative and not looking to take any risk. Sometimes your friends aren‚Äôt looking in your best interest because they aren‚Äôt fiduciaries.   For those of you who arent investment savvy, would you think about getting an advisor?   I‚Äôm looking for real opinions here.","Hate is a strong word, but some of them seem to prey on naive people","I think it‚Äôs an industry that‚Äôs been shaken up like travel agents. A really good travel agent is awesome. An average travel agent is a huge waste of money.¬†  And given most are not 80th percentile advisors, it‚Äôs pretty easy to be like, these peeps suck (cost more than their worth).","I work in the industry as well and work with a team that is absolutely amazing. We care deeply about our clients and do more than just invest the cash. There is financial planning and helping with taxes, estate planning, retirement planning, help making sure our clients have enough money to comfortably live until they pass away and hopefully leave a nice chunk to their beneficiaries. Do we charge a fee? Of course, but it‚Äôs reasonable for what we provide.   I think what you see on Reddit is people who are in the top tier of ‚Äúinvestment education‚Äù and they really don‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs worth it for a 75 year old lady to pay us to make sure she‚Äôs safe for the next 20 years. They think it‚Äôs as easy as dump it all in VTI - which for most people is usually a good idea until they get close to retirement, that‚Äôs when the real work comes in.

I can go on forever about Reddit and the real world but just keep this in mind: If you actually give a shit about your clients and do your best to take care of them.

Big brokerage firms prey not only on investors, but also new reps.   It is well established that 90% of new advisors will fail. Brokerage companies and senior advisors count on it. Bring in 10 wide-eyed, bushy tailed new grads to solicit their family and friends. Once they've sold all they can, they drop out, turn those clients over to the office and the senior gets his pick of the book. Small clients without potential go to the next man up, and so on.","Speaking for myself, when I was managing it on my own I tend to deviate and play wsb type of stupidity plays and¬†lose money when I was younger. I also had a gambling problem. A FA made sense in the fact that I can keep a majority of my money out of my hands/access and let it grow the standard way, the 1% fee is more of a safety feature to protect myself from myself.","Not some, more like most",I agree. There‚Äôs scummy people in all industries.

I'd go further and posit that most of the young investors pumping money into stock index funds still don't understand how to spreadsheet model to work backwards from their investment goals. Because they have some discretionary income and very little responsibility, they're just pumping all of their excess cash into a retirement account and patting themselves on the back for it.  When you have several priorities to manage (mortgage, family / kids, retirement, college savings, etc.) then that's where financial planning comes into play.  And this isn't overly complex to do from scratch, but it requires some spreadsheet skills and definitely helps if you understand stochastic modeling.","I decided to end my relationship with mine and start educating myself when I told her that I was planning to save for a bigger apartment and she recommended that I took a 14% loan when the time came so I wouldn‚Äôt have to touch my investments. (I live in a country where effectively there are no mortgages).  She was affiliated to the bank that would have given me the loan. For me, financially illiterate as I was, the conflict of interest was obvious: they wanted to keep my money invested with them because they were charging an AUM commission and they also would get crazy interest for me. It was particularly egregious because when they initially formulated the investment plan they told me that I could expect to earn 8%."

investing,Apr,1btw4x8,Worth opening a brokerage account to invest 100 a month?,I currently have a Roth ira that holds a target date fund for retirement. I started investing for retirement at age 33(35 now). I have some extra money to invest and wondered if it would be a good idea to open a regular brokerage account. I was thinking I could invest 100 a month into VOO. Is it worth opening a brokerage account just to invest 100 a month? Is that too small of an amount to make it worthwhile? Would VOO be a wise choice or should I consider a different index fund? A figured I could lump sum 1000 then put in 100 a month after that.,Any amount saved is better than $0.,"The main point is to not discourage people from getting started, regardless of the starting amount.",Yes- max out your Roth contribution for the year and then start firing away at VOO. Once you get comfortable you may also think about getting out of your Target fund and balancing yourself (all they do is start to shift the fund from stocks to bonds as you get closer to retirement).,Heck yeah. We all start somehow.,"Everybody on the track, no matter how slow, is still lapping the guys on the couch.",It‚Äôs plenty. Especially if you‚Äôre a novice investor.,"&gt; 100 a month into VOO  Unless you have a brokerage that lets you buy fractional shares, you'll have several months between buys... VOO is nearly $500/share.  That's not a *problem*, just mentioning it.    &gt; Is it worth opening a brokerage account  Yes.  &gt; Is that too small of an amount to make it worthwhile?   No.  More is always better and more fun, but any amount is better than nothing.    &gt; Would VOO be a wise choice or should I consider a different index fund?   VOO is fine.  Depending on your brokerage, you might have an easier time buying fractional shares of a mutual fund with the same underlying index.    &gt; This only refers to what I have in the Roth correct?   Not really... You can kind of think of it as having one big portfolio split across multiple accounts.  You want some sort of balance across all of your accounts.  But there's nothing magically, exactly right about what your target date fund has.  Ideally, you've got a bunch of cash sitting somewhere for an emergency fund, and you may have other investments as well.  It's fine.  When you get near to retirement, then you can worry a little more about stuff like whether your portfolio is diversified enough with assets that aren't strongly correlated with stock market returns, blah blah blah.  The target date fund does that automatically based on the date, which is kinda neat, but it doesn't mean you can't do the same yourself with other money in 2 or 3 decades.",Well said.,"&gt; Is it worth opening a brokerage account just to invest 100 a month? Is that too small of an amount to make it worthwhile?  If you can afford to do so, $100 a month is better than $0 a month. Will probably want to max out other tax-deferred or tax-advantaged options first (IRA/Roth if you aren't already matching it, 401k if available, HSA, 529, etc) unless your specific tax situation and investment goals would have it make sense to do otherwise.  &gt; Also, I remember reading that if I have a target date fund I should make this my only investment because anything I add will throw off the balance. This only refers to what I have in the Roth correct? This doesn‚Äôt apply to any investment outside of a roth, correct?  You should be viewing all of your investment accounts as a single portfolio. Since you're in a TDF in your Roth, I'm assuming your intention is to stay at market weight, and that goal should apply across all of your accounts unless you want to intentionally change your allocation.  As an example, having $1000 in a TDF in your Roth = you're consistent with market weight. If you then open the brokerage and put $1000 into VOO, you'd then overweighted in the S&amp;P by $1000.","Assuming you max out your Roth IRA and don't have access to a 401k, then a brokerage makes sense.  VOO is fine, but a combination of VTI/VXUS is better."

Why not just report the SP500 or NASDAQ or the total market and move on from DJIA? Am I missing something important about The Dow?","It doesn't, lol.","Another thing that annoys me is how the news almost always reports stock market gains in points.

I don't care about the points, just tell me the percent god damnit!","because a number ""means something"" and that news airtime isn't going to fill itself so they gotta say something, even if it's completely useless","I‚Äôll go against the grain here, I think the DJIA does matter. I‚Äôll concede that it‚Äôs not as good a measure as the S&amp;P, but still really solid.  1. It‚Äôs by far the oldest index. The S&amp;P was only created in the 50s. Sure you can go back and approximate what it would have been, but with the Dow we KNOW exactly what it was going back into the 19th century. This index is a tool to help people look at long term macro trends.  2. You really don‚Äôt need 500 companies to track the movements of the US economy. The Dow might only contain 30 stocks, but that‚Äôs really all you need to get an accurate picture of the market.  3. The S&amp;P is actively managed too. There is a group of people that set standards that a company must meet before it can be included, it‚Äôs not just market cap. While I generally agree with these restrictions, they are man-made, so to say.¬†  While I prefer tracking the S&amp;P as well, I think saying the Dow is ‚Äúuseless‚Äù isn‚Äôt correct either. It does a good job tracking the US economy and its longevity does matter.","This 100%. Trading friends will call me and say XYZ is up 100 points! I don't speak that language, I only speak percentage moves.",I think you also need to address DJIA weighing components by stock price rather than market cap.  Ex: Unitedhealth Group ($400B market cap) is weighted 2.75x *higher* than Apple ($2.6T market cap) in the DJIA index simply because the price of UNH is higher than AAPL.   There are historical reasons for this of course. Just naively adding up the stock prices was easier than having to adjust by market cap in the age before computers. But it's a very silly way of doing things today.,"So everyone here is beating up the Dow. Most are not wrong in their facts but to say it is irrelevant is simply not true. The Dow is representative of what are generally considered the ""blue chip"" stocks. Because there are so few companies (only 30) and they are generally among the most well established, substantial changes to this index can be reflective of broader economic concerns both positive and negative.   Yes, I would agree the S&amp;P 500 is a better representation of the broader market but because it has gotten so tech heavy I personally think that has increased the value of the DJIA as a measuring tool especially for clients who are at an age where they are more concerned with asset preservation over asset growth.","It's also just the highest number index, so they get to say ""DOW DROPS 400 POINTS!!!"", when that's just like a 1% move and entirely common, but big number sound scary and get clicks",Because it makes for more reactionary headlines,"I‚Äôve been working in finance for nearly a decade.

If the market goes down in the second half of the year, you're at a loss. The time frame is 30 years so buying early one year doesn't really matter. However, if you frontload your contributions for the first 2-3 months of the year, you get to keep more of your paycheck for the rest of the year. Contributing throughout the year at a high enough rate to eventually max your 401(k) by December 31st brings your monthly budget down which isn't ideal for obvious reasons.",My employer matches 50% so I usually throw my entire q1 bonus at it and try to knock it out.  My logic is might as well grab up all that match in case I get laid off later in the year.

I guess it doesn't matter if you get no match...","Interesting. Our employer doesn‚Äôt allow you to do that. Matches are always even throughout the year unless you hit the max contribution and are no longer contributing. If you front load your contributions, you get a true up at the end of the year for matches.","My employer only matches if contributions are made off of every paycheck, and it's quite a significant amount of free money.",Most companies will do a true-up contribution in January of the following year when an employee maxed early and the maximum match was not made.,"My match definitely doesn't work this way, the match throughout the year is calculated on a per pay period basis, i.e. 3% of that paycheck.  If I max out in March I won't get my match dollars for the other 9 months until a true up in January, and if I quit in December I forfeit 9 months of matching.  So my strategy has been to front load some but leave enough remaining to continue at 6% withholding (required amount to get full 3% match) until November or December before I max out.","you figure out the minimum contribution you need to make each paycheck to get the full match, then subtract that from the total max for year, then take the difference and front load until you hit that value.","My company recently switched to a one time match, in Q1 of the following year.

Things were going South with US/China relations for a while before that. In the 2012 election debates, Obama mocked Mitt Romney for his ‚Äú1980s foreign policy‚Äù when Romney implied that Russia was the biggest threat to the US. The second term of the Obama administration really saw the pivot to Asia begin, as China became the main threat perceived. The TPP was meant to be a massive economic effort to  effectively decouple from China and reorient our trade around other nations within the region. That never ended up coming to fruition as Trump and Bernie were both pretty adamantly against it and soured public perception towards it. Hillary Clinton distanced itself from it and the whole thing was dead in the water before Election Day. But by 2016, relations with China were already quite tense and Xi only amplified this further,"
investing,Apr,1cb7yw8,Are EVs a bad investment right now?,"The EV industry, previously recognized as an area of growth and technological advancement, now appears to be under considerable pressure. Recent developments reveal a general downturn across the sector, with Tesla, one of many players, implementing significant job cuts. The company has announced a reduction of over 14,000 jobs worldwide, particularly impacting its major operations in the U.S. and China.  Elon attributes these layoffs to a drop in sales and increasing competition in the EV market. This decision is reflective of broader challenges facing the industry, not just Tesla. A recent analysis indicates a significant reduction in job postings among leading EV manufacturers over the past three months. This trend could be an early indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for the sector, suggesting a possible reevaluation of growth strategies among these companies.

I‚Äôd stay away, and I work in the space","If any startup in the EV space has a chance, its Rivian. Fisker outsourced everything and still lost big time. Lucid has very deep pockets from the Saudis but cars aren't selling. I don't hear much about Canoo, Polstar, etc. They are all very far from entering the mainstream.

investing,Apr,1c8xita,Walmart RSU‚Äôs: What to do with them?,"Good day, All.  6 months ago I made the jump from my previous employer over to Walmart because Walmart gave me an offer I just simply couldn‚Äôt refuse.  I receive annual RSU awards as part of my compensation package.  The RSU award has a 3 year total vesting period where 8.3% of the award vests every quarter (if that makes sense).  I just received my first award last week.  I know a commonly held belief is to sell RSU‚Äôs as soon as they vest as to not leave all your eggs in 1 basket and to diversify, and, ultimately, protect your money/assets in the event the company goes under, but with a company like Walmart, would this still be the case?    What‚Äôs the best play from a financial standpoint where I could see fairly rapid growth?    If I‚Äôm being honest, I was with my previous company for 7 years and was, what I felt, very underpaid.  I have been contributing 10% to 401k over the past 7 years (and continue to do so with Walmart), but my 401k is not where I feel it needs to be if I‚Äôm going to retire before I die.  I feel like I‚Äôve got quite a bit of time I‚Äôm needing to make up for, and just wanting to make the right decisions to get me back on track.","If the company gave you cash instead of RSUs, would you use it to buy Walmart stock?  The result should be the same either way.",What I normally do is sell my RSU's immediately at vest and then buy index funds. It's safer to diversify than have all your eggs in one stock.,It took me way too long to understand this mindset.,The general advice is to liquidate them.   You already have a lot of exposure to their upside if the stock does well because of your unvested RSUs.   That's why it's usually better to de-risk the vested balances.,The gall of my manager to try and convince me to keep mine after they vest because of the ‚Äúupside‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt say it out loud cause politics but this is the exact question that came to mind.,"There are no tax implications with RSUs, you pay the tax when they vest to your account, if you sell them the same day you would have a gain of $0 to pay taxes on.","It doesn't matter how good the company is, the optimal decision is to treat it as cash. If they gave you the same amount of cash instead - would you:  \* Decide that this cash should go to your savings  \* Decide that you will use your savings for investing in individual stocks (as opposed to a lower effort and lower risk investing in index funds)  \* Decide that out of all the stocks out there, your employer's stock is the best one to buy  \* Decide that the fraction of your income that you want to invest in this stock just *happens to be exactly the fraction that your employer decided to be in RSUs vs salary.* What a wonderful coincidence!  If you can say yes to all of the above, then you should keep the vested stocks. But if you're keeping it just because it's the default option through inaction then you're being irresponsible with your money.","The only difference between getting a cash reward and a stock in Walmart on the day it vests is that you have to do a few more steps to get the cash. There‚Äôs no advantage in keeping it. Compare with say, a small business stock where there are special tax breaks for keeping it a certain amount of time, or an ESPP where holding it long enough gives you long term vs short term tax cap gains incentive. You don‚Äôt get that with an RSU when it vests, you get taxed the same as you do income. If you hold it you will just pay some cap gains taxes.   And one other thing to consider is that you also have more RSUs coming your way over time. In a very technical sense of the word you have an investment in Walmart with guaranteed paydays for the time you put it (not counting your salary)  Keeping your Walmart stock because you believe in the company is then your own personal decision and it goes back to OP asking if you would invest cash in them or not. And with a corp that large I don‚Äôt think your personal output is going to affect the stocks price in any meaningful way unless you are closer to an insider/director/exec level and in that case you have buy/sell windows to consider anyway.  What everyone else is saying is you can sell Walmart shares and still invest elsewhere and you don‚Äôt lose out on anything in this event.","You are taxed at vestment as regular income. If the stock gains value between the time you vest and the time you sell, then that portion and only that portion is subject to long term or short term capital gains.","I'm the other way around -- I couldn't believe my colleagues couldn't grasp this from the start, and proselytized selling shares for years and years. Turns out my colleagues who held onto their Meta RSUs weren't so dumb after all."

Apparently, Primerica also had a bunch of fees on top of that. When the funds were moved over, I liquidated them and moved them into low cost ETFs.

investing,Apr,1c29pw9,HYSA vs Money Market Fund,"Hey folks. I have access to a MMF (not a money market *account*) that will pay as much as the typical HYSA. So the question is, does it offer any advantages over a HYSA. If I leave cash in a money market fund for a year and then move some of it out to invest in stocks only after a year, would it be taxed at long term capital gains? (Rather than the regular income tax rate that would apply to a HYSA. )  So in other words, given the option between a HYSA and money market fund that offer the same rate, will the latter will generally be the better option because of the potential tax advantage, if you leave cash in it long enough (and the interest rates on both stay at least at parity, obviously- which I‚Äôm expecting to be the case as they‚Äôre both variable APR and driven by the same market forces)  Thanks!","Money Market Funds are pegged at $1 , there is no capital gains .  The only real difference is some money market funds only hold USA treasuries and in that case your interest would be exempt from state taxes, where HYSA interest is taxable at the state level (this does not matter if you live in a state with no income tax)  However this depends on the money market fund, other fund holds other debt and the interest will be taxable just like a HYSA  The other difference might be HYSA may be slightly more liquid , for your Money market fund to get cash you would need to sell the fund , wait one business day for the money to be available  Edit  I also forgot to add there are some money market funds that only hold municipal bonds what may be exempt from both federal and state, however usually these are not really worth it unless you are in the highest tax bracket munis because of their favorable tax treatment yield less","Short answer, yes, practically there is almost no reason to use a savings account (""high yield"" is a marketing term) instead of a money market fund that pays higher, competitive rates.  Theoretically the savings account is ""safer."" A savings account is a bank deposit. To you its a debt the bank owes you and nothing more, and its backstopped by the FDIC which has the full faith and credit of the government. A money market is an investment you make into a fund that invests into short term debt that theoretically can go down in value or have gated withdraws. In practice the conditions where that would happen would be so bad to point it probably doesn't matter. In 2008 it was a big deal that a money market failed and fell a few % and it resulted in the fed backstopping the entire money market industry. Since then there is even more regulation and guarantees of $1 peg it is ridiculous to care about any risk there.",It doesn't appreciate. The share price remains at $1. Money market funds give you money by paying interest (in the form of dividends). The taxes that you are will pay are for those dividends.,There is a tax advantage.   It depends on the money market fund. Money market funds must meet certain liquidity and credit risk criteria to be considered a money market fund.   Many money market funds hold treasuries which are exempt from state tax.   There are also money market funds that hold munis so they may be exempt from both state and federal taxes.   Also - wash sales rules do not apply to money market funds.

It takes 2 business days for the money to appear in my bank account.  Which is plenty fast as the vast majority of surprise expenditures either get put on a credit card, or there is time between you becoming aware of them and actually spending the cash.  I would say that the biggest risk with this approach would be having the discipline to not spend your money market funds on ""deals"" in the market.","&gt; it is ridiculous to care about any risk there.  Even if you are worried about risk, just invest in a money market account that only holds treasuries  Yes some funds hold corporate paper and in theory could not be paid back, but others will only hold treasuries or other government backed debt  These would be just as safe as a HYSA, FDIC is backed by the government, its own bonds are also backed by the government  So they are both back stopped by the government. I guess in the case the government does not pay its debt, well that also means it cannot back stop the FDIC","Because it does not appreciate, You buy at $1 a share, you sell at $1 a share.  There will never be any gains or losses  When the fund pays out its distributions you are taxed on those distributions like collecting interest in a HYSA , not when you sell","I think there exist MMFs that invest in things that may be exempt from state taxes, stuff like that... but in general, no tax advantage.  They usually return more then a HYSA though.  Like VMFXX is over 5.2% while a lot of HYSAs are in the 4.5% range.",Gotcha. So no tax advantage basically. Thanks!,"Some money market funds are all or mostly US treasuries, which are exempt from state and local taxes. One example is VUSXX. So if you live in a state with its own income tax, you'll be able to save a little money there."

The thing is, the money I put into investments I don't ""need"" in any foreseeable future. I live minimalist life and don't need much things to be happy.

I only started investing because I was enjoying learning about the topic, not because I needed to save or multiply money.  What are your long-term financial goals?

investing,Apr,1ce8iy1,How much is too much in an HSA?,"Hey all,  I have an HSA that has about $30,000usd in it, and every month I contribute $300.00usd more.  I was told that an HSA is a good place to store money because it's a pre-tax amount that can be set aside for medical expenses, so I just dump money in there.  But when discussing this strategy with a friend, she balked and asked why I have so much money in there?  I didn't really have an answer other than, ""I forgot that I was contributing $300/mo""  Is $30,000 too much in an HSA, and with that amount, does it make sense to contribute more each month?  Part of me is second-guessing my strategy.  Would it make more sense to roll that $300/mo into a separate investment account?  ($1000/mo to my 401k, which is matched by my company.  If I add more, I don't think they'll match it as I'm at their contribution limit.)  Would it make sense to see if that HSA has some investment opportunity to earn money while it just sits there?  I'm 41 and in good health.  Kids (middle-school aged) are risk averse.  Wife is in relatively good health.  We don't visit the doctor much.  What's your thoughts?","An HSA works just like other pre-tax retirement accounts with the added benefit that if you use it for qualified medical expenses, there's no taxes on the withdrawal. If it's not for qualified expenses then you pay income tax, just like a traditional 401k or IRA. So there's no such thing as too much.   And just like 401ks or IRAs, you're supposed to pick an investment. You don't just contribute cash and let it sit there. You should probably learn more about managing your retirement accounts.",Who told you you have too much in there? Do you know how expensive retirement homes and medical procedures cost? A lot.,Definitely invest it while it's in there. Money will grow tax free. There should be multiple options for you to invest in.,6 figures in my HSA and I am not stopping.  Medical expenses get expensive in retirement and if you maintain your health it basically turns into a IRA for non-medical in retirement.  HSA is too fantastic of a investment vehicle to not max it out indefinitely.,"I appreciate the advice.  I guess I never looked at the HSA as a ""retirement account"" but as a pre-tax medical expense bucket, and when it was said that I had too much in there, it got me thinking.  I'll have to contact my HSA and see what type of investment options I have with the fund.  Thanks again!","You‚Äôd have to have an awful lot of money in an HSA or free, or close to it, health insurance for life for you to have too much money in an HSA.  HSAs can be used to pay health insurance premiums which are sky high so even a massive HSA could be consumed quickly.  Then there‚Äôs the cost of actual healthcare.  Even if you are in absolutely perfect health with ZERO health care expenses but you carry health insurance and your health insurance premiums are $700 per month.  You‚Äôd need an HSA with $105,000, assuming investment growth of 8%/year, before the HSA would fully cover your health insurance premiums alone without reduction of the principal in the HSA.  Again that is with ZERO healthcare costs.  If I were 30 and had access to an HSA I‚Äôd keep funding it until it reached a bare minimum of $100,000 if I could.",Typically you are required to turn the investment on and select your funds.

investing,Apr,1ce3fng,Why do people here hate investing in Emerging Markets?,"Isn't it where the growth is at?   I know past performance is not good, but as investors, shouldn't we be forward looking?  If my horizon is 30 years, isn't it unwise to not put money in Emerging Markets?   Is it home bias that we put so much in US?   Is it naive to think that there will not be growth in EM?  &amp;#x200B;","That's a great question. The primary reason is that in the US, much of the wealth accumulation happens through the stock market - [61%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx) of Americans own stocks. Whether it is through 401Ks or active investing, people think of the stock market as how they will get wealthy.   The figure is [23%](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/why-some-chinese-invest-in-the-stock-market-and-others-dont/) for China, but more importantly, only 3.5% of their financial assets are in the stock market. This is because the primary mode of wealth creation is real estate, which 55% of Chinese own.   For Brazil the number is [2%](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/01/14/first-time-investors-are-flooding-brazils-stockmarket). Vietnamese folks store in gold. Etc.  Essentially, majority of the gains from economic growth are not channeled into the stock market, and so the stock market does not reflect that growth. Of course, there's a feedback loop here - because folks don't park money in the markets, they don't go up; and because they don't go up, people don't park money in markets as much.","Mostly because the market is not the economy, and it strongly applies to emerging markets.  The local economies could be booming, but nascent capital markets imply that this boom is not reflected in stocks. With some exceptions, like India and Brazil.",No country is more committed to driving their stock market up than the US.  The rules are engineered that way.  The game is fixed that way.  It‚Äôs easier to go with the wind than against it.,"All of the others have made good points.

The government always comes before the success of the companies in e.g. China. Jack Ma the previous CEO of Alibaba criticised the party and they made him disappear for a few months. The ATH of the stock happened the month he disappeared and has dropped like a rock since.   Foreign investors are also less likely to invest in countries that aren't safe.

I am leaning towards a basic 3 fund portfolio. I am fearful however of losing a large portion of my savings in the market since nothing in the market is guaranteed. My biggest fear is that the US markets, as improbable as it may be, experience what the Japanese Nikkei experienced in the 1990s. Have any of you battled with a similar fear as me? If so, do you have any tips?",Develop a bigger fear of not investing,"If you had been dollar cost averaging in the Japanese Nikkei since 1990 you would have gotten around a 8% return.

What you‚Äôre doing is buying the total market. These companies are for the most part run by smart greedy people who are going to make your stock go up as their actual job. If you‚Äôre 30 there is no other way to make it to retirement than to conquer your fear, grasshopper.",Investing might 'probably' make you lose a significant portion of your money in the market.

And if something ever happens to do real, permanent damage to it, a lot of other assets are going to suffer at the same time, so why worry?","Fun fact: from 1900 - 2020, Australia actually beat the US in annual returns.","Well, for starters I would diversify beyond the US and do so meaningfully (not this 5-20% ex-US that folks with recency bias love to preach).",Clever :)
investing,Apr,1catoat,Making investment decisions based on total market trends or on specific exuberant industry? Wanna know your opinion.,"I'm curious about what should be in the first place when making an investing decision. I am an amateur investor and have noticed that there are 2 types of people around me, those who look at what sectors are hot these days and go for it, and those who only buy in specific exuberant industry shares that they are more familiar with. And I would like to know what information is urgently needed when venturing into an unfamiliar area. There's too much information on the market and it's updated every second.Should I invest in rapidly growing sectors like AI, or stick to industries that I am familiar with?","Couple of things:  1. Single stocks and sector ETFs have idiosyncratic risk. That means that they have risks particular to them that could be diversified away by a whole market fund without lowering expected returns. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not a good idea to invest directly in single stocks or sectors.  2. If you‚Äôre investing for the long run it‚Äôs not a good idea to invest into ‚Äúhot‚Äù sectors. When everybody wants to invest in something that drives the price of the shares up (supply and demand). Higher prices equal lower expected returns. That means that if that sector has great profits you still won‚Äôt have great returns because you paid too much for those profits.   3. Performance chasing has had really horrible results for investors. People get in after it‚Äôs too late and don‚Äôt do well. Overvalued stocks can also crash when people finally realize that the increase in the stock price cannot be supported by the actual profits of the company.  4. So, don‚Äôt invest in hot industries and don‚Äôt invest in industries you ‚Äúknow well‚Äù. Invest in everything because no one can predict what‚Äôs gonna perform better in the future (though it probably won‚Äôt be what has performed exceptionally well in recent times). So a whole market index fund or ETF.","The pandemic has nothing to do with this. This philosophy of investing has nothing to do with any specific event.  As you seem open to learn and change your views, I wholeheartedly advice you to study about the theory and history of investing. You will learn the following:  1. Markets tend to be efficient (even of they‚Äôre not perfectly so). That means that prices of shares reflect all the public information and expectations of the people that are investing. So if people expect that an industry will outperform, that will be immediately reflected in the price of its shares.  2. Consequently, you cannot reliably time the market. It‚Äôs impossible to know if it‚Äôs a good time to buy or sell. When the market thinks it‚Äôs a good time to sell, because of something that it expects to happen tomorrow, it will sell today and vice versa. So all of the information that you think you can use has already been used.  3. All institutions and professional investors are competing and trying to outsmart each other. They‚Äôre trying to find mispriced assets and buy them, and overpriced assets and short them. When you buy or sell something you are competing against them. Do you expect to do better?  4. This competition makes it impossible even for them to consistently time the market or find good deals. 85% to 95% of profesional investors underperform the S&amp;P 500. Those that do outperform during one period are not the same that do it the following one. In other words, outperformance is due to luck.  6. Through history, there have been several fads and trends and they‚Äôll all have performed the same way: something starts doing well, everyone starts investing in it, it does well for several yeas, even institutions start investing in the fad even if they know it‚Äôs a fad with the hopes of being able to tell when it‚Äôs the right time to sell, and finally there‚Äôs a crash and everyone loses a lot of money. That happened when railways were invented two hundred yeas ago, when the Internet was starting to be widely used at the start of this century and several times in between.  7. Several studies, from the 1960s until recent years have shown that stock picking and marker timing are strategies that on average severely underperform just holding the market.

If you couldn't stay in front of the screen all the time at least you should check the P/L analysis always. The potential maximum upright and downside analysis works and I usually make a move when I see the warning. As long as you don't think about maximising the profits, you basically won't lose money.","Points 2 and 3 are kind of contradictory to the fundamentals of index investing. If someone told me Tech was too hot in 2013, they‚Äôd be (*at a minimum*) a decade too early. The SP500 is heavy tech because tech‚Äôs momentum raised its collective market cap head and shoulders above every other industry. Chasing that performance is what drove the momentum.   Nasdaq-100 did even better than the market because it *excluded* two lagging industries, financials and energy.   I‚Äôm not advocating a different takeaway really, but it helps to understand the systematic principles driving indices.",A lot of thanks!!,"Won't read someone's advice and make a decision right away..Just think the time cost to learn in investing is very important so I wanna choose the right area to avoid larger losses.

investing,Apr,1cgfqs3,Recent crypto bull run has pushed crypto portfolio over 10% of total portfolio. Time to trim?,My current portfolio is sitting at just over 118k right now with approximately 12k in cash for an emergency fund and also savings I'm growing with the plans of buying a house in the future.   About 95k is comprised of my retirement accounts and traditional brokerage.  I've held some positions in crypto for a few years that I bough in the bottom of the last bear market and they've since grown to a position of about 10-11k so I'm considering trimming some of that portion of the portfolio to either move it to cash or put a portion back into some index funds in either the s&amp;p or maybe a total market fund like vti.  Curious what everyone's take is on how much I should trim this portion of the portfolio if at all.   Obviously I like speculating in the crypto space but having this high of an allocation would be considered questionable in most circles.  I'd appreciate some feedback.,"What ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù do you have exactly?  If we‚Äôre talking NFTs or random memes/shitcoins, sell all of it immediately.  If it‚Äôs BTC or ETH you can safely keep holding as they are far safer. But overall it also depends on your risk tolerance.","I wouldn't trim for the sake of 'prudent portfolio management' unless you're managing other people's money. If it's your money, let your winners ride for as long as you believe they will continue to go up.","The best approach is to ser rebalancing rules beforehand and not doing because of what you think of market conditions.  First you should set asset allocation targets (like 80% stocks, 10% bonds, 10% crypto or whatever).  Then you could follow one of these systems:  1. Rebalance every year. Sell what‚Äôs above the target and buy what‚Äôs below.  2. Set rebalancing bands Sell or buy when an asset surpasses the band. Usually they recommend absolute 5% or relative 25% (whichever is less). So if the asset target is 10% you rebalance when it surpasses 12.5% (10 plus 10x25%). If its target is 50% and it drops under 45% (50 minus 5) you buy more.  3. You rebalance with your new contributions. When you invest you direct more money to whatever is under its target.","Majority is the ""large cap"" coins like btc and eth with some smaller alt coin projects in the mix.

investing,Apr,1c01kp4,Macroeconomics: Japan and China,"Is anyone interested in global macroeconomics?   I recently spent time doing a deep dive into both major Asian economies and what I found was fascinating.   Here‚Äôs a summary of my findings.  # üáØüáµ Japan  *Point 1 TLDR: Japan is now less like a factory and more like an investment firm that‚Äôs living off past investments.*   Japan enjoyed three decades as an export superpower from the 1980s to 2008. In those years, Japan‚Äôs balance of payments have been persistently positive and large, led by export income.   This allowed it to build up a massive capital account and it used this capital account to invest internationally.   This is partly why Japan today is the largest foreign holder of US treasuries at over $1.1 trillion. China is the second largest holder with $0.8 trillion. Besides treasuries, Japan has a vast amount of other foreign investments like US equity and US real estate.   Japan has since lost its export supremacy and exports have been anemic, resulting in trade flows oscillating between net positive and net negative in the last few years.  (With China‚Äôs automobile exports ramping up significantly in the past 3 years, Japan‚Äôs exports are going to be in even worse shape)   However, Japan‚Äôs balance of payments have consistently been positive, despite the weakening of its export flows. How so? The fascinating thing is that over the past few years, Japan‚Äôs export income has largely been replaced by investment income. In other words, Japan is now less like a factory and more like an investment firm, that‚Äôs living off past investments.  *Point 2 TLDR: Low wages + Low consumption + Low inflation.*   The Japanese people don‚Äôt consume much. This is partly caused by their generally minimalistic attitude (Danshari, Êñ≠Êç®Èõ¢) partly caused by a rapidly aging population, and partly caused by stagnant wages.   We can see this in the economic numbers. Japan‚Äôs private consumption as a % of GDP is one of the largest among developed nations:   United States: 68.2% in Q4 2023.   United Kingdom: 62.7% in Q3 2023.   India: 63.6% in Q4 2023.   Japan: 53.5% in Q4 2023.   Japan‚Äôs wages have been nominally stagnant since the early 2000s. Yet there has been little societal unrest. The people keep getting work done with a high quality bar. This reliable, high quality labor output is partly the result of another Japanese attitude of a relentless pursuit of excellence (Kodawari, „Åì„Å†„Çè„Çä).   *Post 3 TLDR: Large scale central bank money-printing, persistently low inflation and large investment incomes allow the BoJ to do this without crashing the Yen.*   Persistently low inflation and large foreign investment incomes have allowed the Bank of Japan to print a huge amount of money through the most aggressive QE policies (buying equities, corporate bonds, yield curve control, negative interest rates) the developed world has ever seen.   Despite Japan‚Äôs economy being 1/6th the size of the US economy, the BoJ has matched the Federal Reserve‚Äôs pace of printing money. Crazy.   How is the BoJ able to print money at this scale without crashing the Yen? The aforementioned large foreign investment income and persistently low inflation. For example, Japan‚Äôs gargantuan war chest of $1.1 trillion USD is like a cannon pointed at the heads of any intrepid hedge funds that wants to short the Yen.   This is why shorting the Yen or Japanese Government Bonds is sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúwidowmaker trade‚Äù.  # üá®üá≥ China  *Point 1 TLDR: Unlike Japan, China‚Äôs exports are booming.*   As Japan fades as an Asian export power, China has largely taken its place. Despite a trade war with its largest trade partner, the US, China‚Äôs recent export volumes have been stable at historic highs.   In fact, did you know that China went from the world‚Äôs 4th largest car exporter to the world‚Äôs largest in just 2 years from 2021 to 2023 (between South Korea, Germany, and Japan)? It currently holds the top spot by a large margin. The rapid growth of its auto industry has been nothing short of *phenomenal*.  *Point 2 TLDR: Unlike Japan, China‚Äôs economy is seeing significant capital flight*   China‚Äôs capital outflows have been persistently negative and large in the past 4 years. Chinese and foreign investors alike have been rushing to divest from the company.  As one American CEO said after attending the China Development Forum for a week: ‚Äúwealthy Chinese are fearful and selling items that are seen as ostentatious, such as private jets, because it‚Äôs dangerous to be rich in China.""   However, because China‚Äôs exports are booming, its current account flows have remained consistently positive despite the large ongoing capital flight.   *Point 3 TLDR: Unlike Japan, China‚Äôs central bank refuses to print money, despite a population that consumes less while producing more than Japan.*   Japan might be on the low side among developed countries in terms of private consumption but the Chinese people take frugality to the extreme. Japan‚Äôs private consumption as a % of GDP is at 53.5% whereas China‚Äôs stat is at just 40%!   China has the lowest private consumption as a % of GDP among all developed nations, and by a wide margin.   At the same time, the Chinese workforce is producing a lot as seen with its booming exports.   China‚Äôs domestic demand is very weak right now, investors are divesting from the economy in droves, yet the central bank refuses to print money, even though it has so much room to do so.   Very odd.  # üí° So how is this relevant to swing trading?  Both China and Japan‚Äôs stories are of capital flowing into the US.   Capital flowing into the US keeps asset prices up and partially explains the antifragility of the US stock market over the past 2 years even as interest rates soared.   The Bank of Japan‚Äôs incessant money-printing and heavy suppression of short and long-term interest rates despite rising interest rates worldwide is causing a lot of capital to move to the US in search of higher yields.   Capital flight from China is capital into the US. The money coming out of China has to be invested somewhere and the US is the top destination for investment capital in the world.   When Japan slows down its money printing (it‚Äôs already starting to do so), or capital starts to return to China, this is bad for the US stock market, so a US investor needs to pay attention to both possibilities.","This is all insanely interesting.¬†   I have to ask what your credentials are, why and how you go about researching this topic and if you have a bias being in the US or out of the US.

Or books that helped you on this research?¬†   I appreciate you taking the time to respond!","Yup, there's that. Lots of asian funds are reallocating to Japan because of China tail risk rising a lot recently. But also a lot of Japanese companies started to deploy their large cash reserves to buyback shares. It's kinda like a corporate-led version of QE, in a very rough sense. Japanese company stock buybacks have been soaring in the past 2 years. Not sure if it's coordinate but it's definitely drawing more foreign capital into the US stock market (along with divesting from China -&gt; investing in Japan).",Isn't a large amount of Chinese capital currently flowing into Japan as a result of the US embargo? I thought that was the reason (or *a* reason) Japan's stock market suddenly woke up last year.,Their credentials are chatgpt,"As a Chinese Canadian, I can attest to the rigorous saving habits of the Chinese (although lost in 2nd gen immigrants).  However I also know Chinese people generally hate investing and heavily prefer using their savings towards real estate.  Chinese people see the stock market as gambling and most either use it as a substitute for gambling or only use a small fraction of their savings towards it.    No doubt China has enough people and economic power that outliers themselves present a substantial amount of money towards US but is there stats on how much capital outflow from China goes into US markets excluding real estates?  I've always been curious.  Im from HK which is culturally different from rest of China but I always assume people from mainland China mostly invests in Chinese companies due to their extremely strong nationalistic views which persist in recent immigrants in Canada.  And we know how badly the chinese stock market is doing.","well.

investing,Apr,1c80vu9,When do you take the money out of your investments?,"I was wondering how you approach your invested money. A lot of people save for their retirement, but assuming you don't want to retire early and have a solid income that you know will suffice for your retirement when it's time, do you take the money out of your investments (assuming you're not taking out a large percent of your investments) for things such as more expensive holidays from time to time, financing a car you've always dreamed of, etc. or do you just put away some money from your regular income from that? Basically, assuming you have all your basic needs covered with your regular income, what are the things you'd be willing to spend your invested money on?","Ideally / math wise never but honestly as a fin planner, i advise my client grow their asset while remembering to live. Stop waiting until 60-65 to start doing the stuff you wanna do.

I will take my wife n i‚Äôs whole family to a nice cruise or trip to hawaii. We take them to small trips every year to spend time but once a few yrs we like to have a really nice proper gathering for everyone to reconnect","Need to remind myself to do this, I literally put as much as I can into my investments as soon as I‚Äôm paid and I can barely afford to eat","Saying ""never"" is for weirdos who think the point of investing is just to watch a number grow but never actually use it for the things in life that matter.   The real answer comes down to what your goals are. If you are investing for retirement then you plan your sells in increments, move portions into less aggressive/more stable instruments as you move nearer to retirement age, etc. If you are investing for a down payment I would sell 6 months in advance of your house hunt and move the money to a HYSA. Kids' college fund? Would probably sell when they are a sophomore or junior in HS. You get the idea.",Why? That‚Äôs just absurd.,"Judging from my upvotes I‚Äôm not alone in this unhealthy mindset, it‚Äôs to suffer now for a better future.

What's your investment exit strategy?,I never pull out,"If you have a goal and plan before investing for what the purpose is for the money, then this should not be a question . . .  Is the money invested for retirement? If so, what is your goal for how much you want to have at what age? If you are meeting or beating this goal, then you may have the flexibility to withdraw some funds to take a dream trip or buy a car.  A better way may be to set up retirement accounts to meet those goals and ensure they are fully funded, but then set up a vacation or car accounts just for the purpose of paying for those.  I'm of the opinion that I cannot take it with me and while I ensure my wife will be taken care of, and don't mind leaving something for the kids, what good is money if it is just saved and never enjoyed while we're living and able?  Too many times we hear of an old person living in a shack and struggling with everyday living, only to find out when they die they had $4 million dollars in their accounts.   The risks of spending from retirement accounts are any penalties from early withdrawals, and having the discipline to not spend too much and therefore not reaching the goals.",Dope,What about getting a better job?

What is the best way of going about the future, money wise?  I also work full time at a pizza joint making 18 bucks an hour and currently am just making passive income since i still live with my mom and she feeds me and stuff :D","Nope, is never early and never late, you should start now even if just with a low amount, that will give you at least familiarity with the market.","Just stick to the S&amp;P 500, you‚Äôre already ahead of the curve!",Probably best to stick to a World Index.

Congradulations!  The problem you have are great.   Your number one asset is your future wages.  Putting yourself into poverty can be destracting and destructive to your most important asset.

If ultimately it all goes to housing and board that's not a bad use of the funds. While early savings is great, having lots of excess income to save faster is better.   Now in terms of retirement savings you can put $7k / yr into a Roth.  You just missed the date for 2023 but 2024 is still open. If you don't know anything just throw it all into AVGE.  That's a reasonable total portfolio.  Keep doing that till you get to $100k and perhaps beyond.    Now that probably isn't fast enough.  A good way to accomplish both liquidity and growth is a taxable high draw portfolio.  A taxable setup like: 15% AVUV, 15% AVEM, 70% VCSH will get you long term growth about 1.5% below 80/20 with liquidity not much worse than short term bonds. You can draw fast if you need to, but can leave it in there for years without hurting yourself too badly.   BTW what you are doing isn't ""passive income"".  Passive income is income (not capital gains) from investing.  You are just having a subsidized standard of living.","Who knows, maybe some citation might help‚Ä¶   [Anarkulova, Aizhan and Cederburg, Scott and O'Doherty, Michael S., Beyond the Status Quo: A Critical Assessment of Lifecycle Investment Advice (October 2, 2023).](https://ssrn.com/abstract=4590406)",Not sure why you're being downvoted,Roth IRA.

investing,Apr,1c4llvw,Who defines the yield on government bonds? State or investors? ,"I saw in the news, that when a government is in trouble, or the investors are not sure about it's creditworthiness, the investors will require higher yield. My question is, we're talking about yield to maturity, not the coupon yield, right? So it sounds like the investors determine the yield. But how?  The nominal coupon yield is fixed, YTM can change over time. Do investors affect the yield by buying the bonds (in this case) at discount, so that when we calculate the YTM using the bond formula, do we get higher YTM than coupon yield?  So the investors affect the YTM by determining the price for which they are willing to buy the bond? But is the government willing to sell the bond at this price? Or is the market (supply/demand) determining the price?  Thank you","You're correct in focusing on the yield to maturity rather than the coupon yield when looking at how bond yields are influenced by market perceptions.  Coupon Yield is the annual coupon payment divided by the face value of the bond, and it is fixed at the time of issuance by the government (or the bond issuer). Yield to Maturity reflects the total return expected on a bond if held to maturity. It incorporates the coupon payments, the reinvestment of these payments, and the gain or loss incurred if the bond is purchased at a price different from its face value.  When bonds are first issued, the government sets the coupon rate based on the prevailing interest rates and its own funding needs and creditworthiness. If the government needs to attract more investors it might set a higher coupon rate. After issuance, bonds trade on the open market. Their prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, changes in interest rates, and changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the issuer. The fluctuation in price is where investors have a direct impact on YTM. If investors believe there is an increased risk of default, they are less willing to pay a high price for bonds, effectively requiring a higher yield to compensate for the increased risk. If investors start requiring higher yields due to perceived risks, they will pay less for the bond, which pushes the price down and the YTM up. While the government controls the initial coupon rate and terms of the bond, the market controls the bond's price once it is trading on the secondary market.  Example: If a bond with a face value of $1000 and a coupon rate of 5% sells for $900 on the market, its YTM is higher than the 5% coupon rate because the investor is getting the same annual coupon payment of $50 on a lower investment, plus the additional gain of $100 when the bond matures at its face value.","The market does  First in the secondary market its just people trading bonds between each other, the buyer and seller agree on the price (sets the yield)   Even on new auction bonds the process works like this from my basic understanding  The government says something like ""We are going to sell 5 billion of 5 year bonds that have a coupon of 4.5%""  And note they just do not randomly pick a coupon they usually look at the current yield curve and set the coupon somewhat in the range  Now an auction happens  investor A says ""I like that price, I will pay $100 and bid for 2 billion""  investor B Says ""I will pay 99.8 and bid for 2 billion ""  investor C says "" I will pay 99.7 and bid for 1 billion""  investor D says ""I will pay 99.5 and bit for 3 billion""  Now to fulfill the full 5 billion they have to go down to investor C, that's the price  Investor A/B/C gets their bonds for 99.7 investor D does not get anything because they bid too low",I work in this field and second this,"The US Treasury actually doesn't set the coupon until after the auction for new issues.  Bidders bid based on YTM, and then the government will issue the new bond with a coupon rate set to the nearest 0.125% not greater than the accepted auction yield, and then set the price corresponding to the yield.  So if the auction resulted in a yield of 4.49% for a 5-year note, they would set the coupon to 4.375% and the price to 99.49.  If the auction resulted in a yield of 4.5%, they would set the coupon to 4.5% and the price to 100.  For reopening auctions where they auction off more of an existing CUSIP, they keep the old coupon rate and let the price float based on the YTM.  For example: * [New 30-year bond issued in February](https://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2024/R_20240208_3.pdf), coupon is set after the auction to the nearest multiple of 0.125% not greater than the High Yield, and this results in a small discount. * [April re-issuance of that same bond](https://treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2024/R_20240411_3.pdf), the coupon rate is fixed but now there's a bigger discount since the yield is higher.",The government specifies the dollar amount of the coupons paid and the principal paid at maturity. The market determines the price of the bond. All of those things together determine the effective yield you can expect if you buy the bond at market and hold to maturity.,"Yes, Treasury bonds use an auction, where the government sells a fixed volume of bonds to the highest bidder.","In theory, yes. The government isn't stupid though. They want to get their price at the rate they set, and they usually do get pretty close.  You can go to the TD website and see the [auction results](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/results/). They are usually very close.",From my understanding yes even investor A who bid $100 will get 2 billion for 99.7  The YTM will now be higher than 4.5% because of the discount it will be slightly more (approx 4.57%),I was talking about usa govt debt and it looks like anyone can enter  [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/how-auctions-work/](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/how-auctions-work/)  As far as corp debt it seem like unless you are willing to buy like 50 million you probably won't get in on the new issue what is just economies of scale  Its easier to sell the debt to 4-5 big buyers then 4k smaller buyers I would assume,"&gt; Who defines the yield on government bonds? State or investors?  For the USA: Both. Government sets the rate, but the price is up to the market via auction. The treasury.gov website explains how this all works, if you want to get it directly from them.  &gt; My question is, we're talking about yield to maturity, not the coupon yield, right?  yes  &gt; So it sounds like the investors determine the yield. But how?  The price they pay to buy say $10k of 4.5% 1yr treasuries.  Usually it auctions for right around the $10k price. At auction it could sell for 9k or it could sell for 11k, or anywhere in between.  Though again that's for dramatic effect, the prices are usually quite close to the $10k number.   It's an auction, the price is what the market determines. Whoever wins the auction sets the price, everyone else can buy at that price.  Then it hits the secondary market, and it's trading just like every other bond. The above should have answered all your other questions.   Note, other countries can/will do things differently."

I want to wait and pay it off in the last month possible so I can earn interest on this money in the meantime.   My question is: what would you do? Is a high interest savings account really the best way to grow this in 12 months and maintain liquidity so I can quickly withdraw and use it to pay off the card? Should I throw it in an ETF?

But it's usually based on scientific research, prototypes etc.  Do you really have to wait until the technology's bought by a publicly traded market or they eventually reach IPO stage, or is there some way to literally get in on the ground floor when you think something's going to change the world?","you interview with a few of the startups working on getting the tech off the ground, determine which one has the most promising founders, join the company, and get them to give you as much stock as you can.  If any of these types of companies has found a way to let you invest without being a part of the company, do not invest, because theyre only trying to get your money because bigger guys stopped investing","You don't.  The truth is most emerging tech fails. It doesn't matter if you have a battery with double the capacity if it costs 10x as much, for example. I'm a huge tech nerd, I follow tech news super closely. The amount of ""breakthroughs"" I've read about that never become a product... I couldn't even begin to count.

So you're more likely to just get suckered by charlatans and loose all your money.  Anyway, just don't do this.","Yep, and if that doesn't already sound risky in terms of time and effort, just also realize that most start-ups, even the ones that look very promising, still fail to pay out much unless you are a founder. Sometimes it happens, but it seems like most founders and VC firms have gotten wise on limiting the distribution of shares. One company where I worked (that I even did pretty well on when the payday came) refused to reveal their outstanding shares to employees when asked, since they didn't need to. We only found out what the share was when the official buy-out happened. One interesting anecdote: the lawyer we had on payroll and largely in charge of the legal side of this stuff had a huge share compared to other employees, on par with the founders, and he didn't even join until several years in. So your 10,000 shares might end up being like a pretty tiny payday.",Work for that startup or become a certified investor (which requires you to have a minimum wealth threshold).,Invest in angel investors?,"There are many thousands companies if not millions that all want your money and fit the description.

investing,Apr,1c3w6jc,How much should I throw into a U.S. Treasury Bond?,"For context, I have never tinkered with U.S. treasuries. I invest with the cash I am comfortable with. However, in a few months, my High-Yield Savings Account (which you can argue if it even is a HYSA at 3.6%) is going to become a Laughable-Yield Savings Account. I have entrusted fidelity with my my investment portfolio, and would be open to using that platform to invest in U.S. Treasury Bonds. I would say I can use as much as 80% of my savings to invest in a treasury bond, however, how practical is this exactly? I know its generally whatever one is comfortable with, however, I am looking for alternatives once I stop receiving my promotional rate in my HYSA.  I'd be happy to hear how much people are allocating for bonds, for those who are comfortable with sharing, at least in percentages of something.   I do have a grip on my finances (I think). All of my credit cards are being paid off in full every month. After bills (including mortgage), I am generally left with 50% of my monthly take home pay for discretionary use.  Thank you!","If you have a Fidelity brokerage account, your can use SPAXX as your core settlement position and it will earn \~5% until you can determine a proper allocation to treasuries once you better educate yourself.  How much you invest in bonds is a personal choice and should be based on your age, investment timeline and risk tolerance.","Honestly, if you don‚Äôt want to mess with dealing with the treasury direct site‚Ä¶.  Just buy ETF that invest in Short term govt debt  Examples:   USFR, SGOV, TFLO, SHV   They all pay 5% and higher and some can be free from state taxes.       It takes the hard work out of treasury ladders, dealing with the website, having to figure out when auctions are.      Dividends are deposited each month into your account and you can just reinvest the dividends.","Treasuries, or funds with treasuries as the underlying asset, can have very real benefits over SPAXX in a state with high income tax.",Fidelity brokerage account cash in SPAXX is basically my HYSA. I'd argue going further than that and actually buying treasuries is kind of pointless in most cases.,You can do your treasury ladder in fidelity.,"Would it be true that you risk the price of the ETF dropping versus buying treasury bills outright and locking in a rate? I appreciate the post, by the way. I didn‚Äôt know about these.","Rates on Treasury bonds have declined over the past 2 years. I'm still holding some that were getting close to 10% but have since declined to be comparable to Treasury bills.  T-bills are shorter duration (4-52 weeks) vs bonds and given the comparable yields (5.27% for i-bonds and 5.1-5.3% for T-bills), I'd suggest looking at these instead of the longer duration bonds (that also have an interest penalty if you sell before maturity).  They are also State tax free if that's a factor for you.  I prefer to buy my own T-bills vs using a fund like FDLXX (also state-tax free) to save on the expense ratio, but you have to buy in increments of $1000 on Fidelity or Schwab (can set these to auto-roll) or $100 on Treasury Direct, vs down to the penny for the money market funds.","So look at the price history of the ETFs.    They up a few cents a day, then at the end of the month the announce dividend, it drops that‚Äôs much and starts over.     Yes there is some fluctuation, but mainly when dividend is paid.   Also you can sell whenever and after settlement, if can be withdrawn can‚Äôt do that with a Tbill","I'm putting zero into bonds anymore, and have even sold some at a loss.  They are dead money... especially when you can get &gt;5% in a brokerage MM, or buy \*carefully\* selected preferred stocks (with 7-8% yield) as bond proxies.","I have moved 90% of my emergency fund into 4wk treasuries through treasury direct set to auto reinvest. The yield is better than you‚Äôll get through any funds of a similar duration and it‚Äôs exempt from state tax. People complain about the website, but it‚Äôs a lot simpler to use than people make it out to be. I think it gets a lot of hate because it looks dated. Another plus is that you can purchase in $100 denoms versus the $1k denoms when trying to buy treasuries through a brokerage.  The reality is if your buying short duration treasuries why even worry about trying to sell prior to maturity in the first place? I figure if any emergencies arise, I can put it on my credit card until my 4wks mature and pull some money."

investing,Apr,1c8n4h6,How do those of you with a pension invest for retirement?,"Hello all. After reading this and the personal finance subreddit over the years I have become familiar with the general retirement advice that you should invest 15% of your income in low cost index funds, hope for a 7% inflation adjusted return rate over 30+ years, and you might be able to withdraw about 4% annually safely in retirement.   However, I work for the State of Arizona that uses a pension system where I never vest into my employer match unless I leave it until retirement and opt into the system/pension annuity. I am required to put 12% of my paycheck into the system which my employer matches 100%. So for my income of 100k, I ""get"" $24k into the pension, though as I mentioned I can never access the match for say a 401k or IRA rollover.    The tricky part comes from the fact that the pension annuity is calculated not off the total $ amount but a weird formula: ""multiplying your total years of service with ASRS covered employment by your average monthly compensation and by a multiplier factor depending on years of service.""  For example if I stay with ASRS for 30 years  I would get (10 years*(100k/12 months)*0.021 multiplier)= 1750/month or $21,000 a year. This only replaces 21% of my income which isn't ideal. The math shakes out better the longer I stay and reaches 69% if I stay 30 years.  Given I do not know if I will stay employed with the State of Arizona my entire 30+ year career, how can I save the recommended 15%? I can't just add 3% in an IRA since my remaining 12% is locked in a pension not earning the inflation adjusted 7% one could hope for from low cost index funds that track the market or a target date fund.   Any advice on how to figure out if I am on track with my current 12% pension contribution and how much more in addition I need to place in an IRA or 479b to get me to the ideal 15% recommendation? Thank you.","I have a pension at my work (I‚Äôm vested with 19 years - private industry job, not government or a school) and I just invest like it doesn‚Äôt exist. I still max out my 401k annually. I also save to my HYSA. I also live like Social security won‚Äôt exist. I just focus on saving what I can that‚Äôs within my control and still allows me to live - like I‚Äôm not starving myself to save. So I would say basically do what you‚Äôre able to do comfortably within reason and don‚Äôt get so hung up on the %.

I'm not saying it's wrong - just that I don't see the rationale.  The pension is like a large holding of low risk, low return fixed income. That being the case, it seems to me that you probably don't need to worry about adding to your holdings of fixed income or even income equities and can focus instead on higher risk, higher return assets.  Also, it's possible to wind up with too much retirement income. A lot of people find they don't spend as much as they thought they would because almost all of us slow down as we age. For a lot of people, traveling in SE Asia (for example) looks more inviting at 30 or 40 than it does at 70.

Also, working a secondary job after retirement, ""double dipping"", is a strategy I hope to use to build my savings and CD ladder from 55-62 before social security.","I invest as though it does not exist.

OP can probably just assume the pension as the bond portion of their portfolio as nearly risk-free. Probably means any outside investing should be 100% stock market to balance it out.

investing,Apr,1cab8ho,DCA vs Value Averaging: statistical evidence and thoughts,"I recently came upon an interesting concept called Value Cost Averaging (VCA). I've been doing VCA for a while without really knowing what am I doing.   For ppl who don't know what is VCA, the simplified definition of it is as below,  &gt;Value Cost Averaging (VCA) is an investment strategy that adjusts your investment amounts to achieve a preset portfolio growth target, investing more when the portfolio underperforms and less when it overperforms. This method helps buy more at lower prices and less at higher prices, aiming to maximize returns.  What I wanna know is,  1. Is there any statistical evidence on the comparison of DCA vs. VCA in the mid-term and long-term? 2. What are your thoughts on VCA as one's regular investment strategy?","You'd have to be more rigorous in your definitions.  But the big hangup here is that, in order to invest more when your stuff is down, that means you have to be holding back cash when your stuff *isn't* down.  And that usually loses... Like between 2012 and the covid crash, you'd be keeping cash on the sidelines waiting for a drop that generally didn't come.    Because the general trend for the market is up, investing everything you can as soon as you can generally wins.",VCA sounds a lot like timing the market with extra steps.  Don't try to time the market.,"&gt; DCA doesn‚Äôt require holding cash back, and this wouldn‚Äôt have to either.   Generally the distinction between DCA &amp; periodic investing is that DCA is holding cash back.  If I have $100k to invest and I do it in chunks of $20k/month for five months, that's generally what people mean when they talk about DCA.  If I get paid twice/month and invest $10k/pay check then that's just periodic investing.  I realize that people don't always use them that was but that was the idea.","I think it‚Äôs hard for statistical evidence to say anything meaningful, because it will be based on historical data, and we know, what has happened. Hence you can have invested just at the right times and we don‚Äôt know what the future holds.","AFAIK, what you're describing isn't VCA.  VCA is about literally contributing more when markets are down.  What you're describing is just DCA and being a bit smarter about tax efficiency in taxable accounts.",VCA/DCA assumes you have money that could be invested that you're not investing. Every study I've seen has shown that lump sum investing wins if your plan is to buy and hold which is what I think most DCA investors are doing..,"I'm not sure of that exact strategy because you don't have any numbers given, but there is a classic ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy where you basically just pick last year's losers.  Depending on the time period chosen sometimes it outperforms the rest of the Dow, and sometimes it doesn't.  I haven't really looked at the numbers myself.  I'm sure there are variations of this method but Dow stocks tend to be the big blue chips and so are considered more likely to recover after down years (since sector winners tend to rotate).","Well the results would be reliable, but how vaild they are, is another question. I think, you‚Äôd have to run multiple simulation with different bull and bear markets to see which strategy would perform the best under each circumstance. Then you can evaluate the two strategies under each simulation and make a conclusion based on the results.","DCA does not, because you're putting in a fixed amount periodically.  If you're increasing contributions in bad months/years, the money has to come from somewhere.  If it comes from income, then it means you could have been throwing that money the whole time...   If it comes from other assets in your portfolio... then it's just a portfolio with different assets being rebalanced periodically.  That's not a bad thing, but it's kind of the norm.  It does have some buy-low-sell-high effect, but generally your returns are lower in exchange for the lower volatility.    &gt; If you have 60% in VOO and 40% in bonds as your allocation and over time VOO grows to 65% with bonds dropping to 35%, you could put all your monthly deposits into bonds until it‚Äôs back to 60/40.  Sure.  And you'd (on average) do worse than throwing it all at VOO as soon as you could.  Less volatile, lower return.","&gt; especially with the recent geo-political craziness  There is always some sort of craziness on the horizon. If you want to wait for a down, then define it up front. Down from what? 20% from ATHs? What if it drops 19% and heads back up? What is your failsafe entry? What if it goes up another 20% before dropping? The problem is when you really dig into market timing it turns into a feeling, and a feeling is how most people lose all their money.  IMO, if you really want to time the market, then you need have concrete answers to all those questions."
investing,Apr,1c9nhgt,Should I Prioritize maxing my 457b or 401k or splitting contributions into both?,"Hey everyone, just wanted to pick your brains and see what you guys and gals would recommend or suggest. I work for the City of New York and have access to both a 457b and a 401k. I also pay 6% of my wages into my pension (top pay making $100k+/year).   I currently split my 18% contributions into each (9% into 401k and 9% into my 457b). With my Military buy back, I can retire at 51 years of age (11 more years). For whatever reason I'm finding myself more and more inclined to tilt 15% into my 457k and 3% into my 401k.   I keep going back and forth on the merits (mainly accessing extra funds at 51 vs 59.5). For added context, I also receive 100% VA Compensation ($4202/mo) which I used to fund my Roth IRA completely in January and then add about $1k/mo into my taxable brokerage account.   Any thoughts on what you guys would do if you were offered both the 401k and 457b.  &amp;#x200B;",457b allows you to walk away from your job at any age and collect it without penalty.  With a 401k you're stuck waiting till 59.5 to withdraw without penalty.,"The caps for 457 and 401k/403b are separate, so you can double contribute.  Max both, but prefer the 457 since there is no early withdrawal penalty and who knows if you might need cash for an emergency.  Better to take a loan if you need money for a house at some point, as that's not considered a taxable event.",People are obsessed with a 401k because most do not have a pension.  Pension + 457 is a great combo.  I have it as well out here in CA (I work for local govt).,"It's literally a 401k not a 403b?  I have 403b, 457b, and DCP with 8% match. I do the DCP match then max out 457b at 23k, IRA at 6.5k, I bonds at 10k. Nothing into the 403b but that'd be next.  The amazing thing about the 457b is that I can withdraw penalty-free from it upon separation, for whatever reason, regardless of my age. That's the best of both worlds to me and why I feel totally comfortable maxing it out even among the other instruments.",Most people don't have access to a 457b also. It's limited to certain employers (mostly government).,OP please be aware of the differences between governmental and non-governmental 457b plans. Many comments here about the downsides of 457b plans do not apply to governmental ones such as your own.,There truly is a sub for everything lol. Thanks for the heads up,"Yea I figured between my Pension, 457, and VA Compensation that would be enough to get me until i get to the age i could even start dipping into my 401k",Yep. Great advice.,"457b plans are non-qualified for ERISA and are considered assets of the organization running them, not assets for the people contributing.  This means that if New York goes bankrupt, your 457b balance will be available for payback of creditors and potentially not you.  I don't consider this much of a risk. However, New York has gone nearly bankrupt in the past. So if the ability to withdraw when you leave isn't useful to you, consider contributing entirely to a 401k instead for ERISA protections."

Their incentive is to increase *costs*, not margins. They would love to increase the margin, but they can't (as you said).  The reason why people pay $10 for a single aspirin is because the margins are so low. It's the only way to make heaps and heaps of profit with low margins.   Also, insurers typically place their incoming money (premiums, deductibles, etc) into higher yielding accounts to offset inflation."

Those standards and insurance requirements made it more expensive to offer pensions and the amount of new jobs with pension benefits drastically decreased as a result.  The choice was never between a 401(k) or a pension. The choice was a 401(k) or nothing. Unsurprisingly, people chose the 401(k). And guess what?

investing,May,1cny37j,Why Are Solar Stocks Doing So Poorly When Headlines Say The Industry Is Booming?,"I've always believed in investing in solar stocks, namely TAN, but it's no surprise to anyone that it's had poor performance for a while.  Despite this, we keep getting headlines stating how good the solar industry is doing. To name a few:  [""Solar to contribute over 60% of new U.S. electricity generation in 2024""](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/05/07/solar-to-contribute-over-60-of-new-u-s-electricity-generation-in-2024/)  [""The US solar market is projected to triple in size by 2028""](https://electrek.co/2023/06/07/us-solar-market-projected-to-triple-in-size-over-the-next-5-years/)  [""Global solar manufacturing sector now at 50% utilization rate, says IEA""](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/05/07/global-solar-manufacturing-sector-now-at-50-utilization-rate-says-iea/)  [""Solar power investment to exceed oil for first time, says IEA chief""](https://www.ft.com/content/990d3ce2-cdc1-4496-ac34-9ba20e0dcaa4)  Yet TAN is down 65% from its peak in 2021. Where is the money for solar going? Are the better avenues other than solar stocks that better capture the recent success of the solar industry?","Also, this is an important thing to understand about investing that most retail people simply don't get or never learned.  Your investment doing well is a function of earnings per share growth, or growth in hard assets per share.   Similar to how GDP growth is uncorrelated with stock returns, sector growth from some vectors is also uncorrelated to returns of stocks in that sector. Significant expansion of shares and companies and such dilutes any given share in the industry. The money raising cycle and growth of absolute adoption doesn't necessarily mean companies inside the industry will deliver great returns on investment.",China is dumping panels on the market.  There are jokes that Chinese people are using solar panels as fencing because they're so cheap.,"Panels are cheap, everything else that goes with them is not. Also, installers markup the panels and sell the very latest top of the line.","I got a $195k ""quote"" to install panels and 3 powerwalls at my house. I don't live in a mansion. I am not super rich. This was not a Tesla solar roof. Running the numbers I would never payback the panels. It was insanity. Where these cheap panels?!","To add, consideration should also be given to the types of companies within the industry. In solar, you have the manufacturer of the panels, the installation companies, the financing companies, and the utility companies, all of which may be different from one another. An installation company will have different business conditions from a panel manufacturer, for example. They would be dealing with less barriers to entry, and therefore, more competition in general (a quick Google search shows in the US, there are over 11,000 solar panel installation companies). Even with growth in the industry, the typical market share by each company may be minimal. Even the most dominant players may struggle to grow market share.",Priced in.,"There are winners and losers in any industry. Some of the bigger solar ETFs seem to have chosen poorly.

investing,May,1cqeumk,Anyone here live comfortably off of dividends?,"I see a lot of dividends talk around passive income streams but I don‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs usually a pretty small amount of money paid out. Can you walk me through the initial capital requirements/math and timeframe for an above average investor to be able to live comfortably from dividends?","To live comfortably off dividends, you‚Äôre already living comfortably.","You can answer your own question. For instance, a sustainable dividend focused portfolio will *typically* pay between 3-5% annually.     So assuming a portfolio of $500,000, that portfolio would pay out around $15,000 to $25,000 a year, ignoring appreciation of the asset.","Indeed. The answer for OP is yes, but you need a lot of money, multi millions. I would say starting at about $5 million you should never have to worry about a job or income again and live comfortably off dividends and still grow your assets.","My dad lives very well on his dividends and stock portfolio. He actually makes more money in dividends than he did a salary. My dad was an above average investor.   But even above average investors need time. My dad is 75 but started investing when he was 16(he started my little bro investing when he was 6).   He was a pharmacist who owned his own business.  He had an above average salary and paid my mom through the business. When it got big enough, he gave employees benefits. One of the benefits was that the company put 10% of his salary into a 401k. He didn't have to match(but it applied to ALL employees). He matched it up to the limit for him and mom every year from 1994 until 2016. Remember, this also happened for my mom. Mom died recently with a 401k value of 5M. Dad's is about 9M.   That's not all, though. Dad also invested another 10% of him and moms salary in the stock market. These investments are close to 12M today. He has some real estate, but that's just because of diversification and is only about another 2M.   Dad made 8k when he opened his business in 1978. He made 279k, and mom got 60k when he finally sold the business to my older brother in 2016.   Dad has close to 30M and earns about 900k in dividends. He spends about 200k, gives about 250k away(all his kids get 25k for Christmas, and his grandkids get 5k each year into a college fund). And then reinvest the rest.   My dad grew up poor. His dad only had a 1st grade education but was great with money as he had to take care of a wife, 3 kids, his mom, and 3 sisters. So he taught dad about money. Dad got his 1st job delivering drugs from a pharmacy when he was 6 in 1955. That was the pharmacy he bought in 1978.   I also ""kinda"" retired about 5 years ago at 40. My dividends cover most of my living expenses. So, I get to choose what I do on a daily basis. And I choose something that I enjoy doing and make a bit of money doing it. My wife does the same. But, at 46, you still need stuff to do on a daily basis. And truth be told, I would probably still do what I am doing even if they didn't pay me.","That‚Äôs $150-250k per year on top of appreciation.  If those are your expenses, you‚Äôre definitely living large.  And, yea, living in a high cost area is living large..",Holy shit. Imagine getting 25k every Christmas.,"This is wildly out of touch.    The median income in the US is only ~35k. Median household income is around ~75k.   The vast majority of people are getting by on way less than $150k, including raising kids and having hobbies.    The fact you think buying a $50k car every few years is totally normal and a baseline of average living is also wild. The average age of cars on the road is 12+ years. Normal people aren‚Äôt buying new car every few years.","Definitely living very comfortably, just not first class every single flight or whatever you associate with a millionaire lifestyle.","It is a straight forward equation.  To live entirely off the dividends, take your required income (pre tax etc.) and divide by the dividend return rate of the portfolio.    So, if you need a 70K income and assume a 3% return from dividends you need 2.33 Million in capital (70000/.03).","5 million? Shit, I‚Äôm done working at a million. I can live well below 50k/yr"

I am 30 year old guy and don‚Äôt make much but would like to retired around 55 or 60 and be comfortable at least. I would like to know if people that lost their money during the crash were able to retrieve it back if they had just left it in there and weathered the storm or if they took it out does that mean they just took some losses and carried on? I hear stories of how people lost their homes and stuff so I just wanted to understand hypothetically what would have happened to me if I was investing back then. Please forgive my ignorance as I‚Äôve never invested before and I‚Äôm not a from a region where investing is encouraged much so my question my look dum but any help and advice to get clarity on this and maybe how I should start out would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!,"I was an older teen, but lemme tell you what happened to my family: We had an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) and it went up so my parents couldn‚Äôt quite make payments. Then my dad lost his job at the same time that everyone else in his industry did, so he had to take a lower-paying job. My parents tapped their retirement funds to put food on the table for their children and keep the roof over their heads. It didn‚Äôt work, and they lost the house after all. In the course of 2 years, we went from middle class and house rich to working poor with nothing. My parents *still* haven‚Äôt fully recovered to where they were before the crash.  Conversely, I‚Äôve done quite well for myself because I never forgot the lessons they were nice enough to model for me: Have a house that you can still afford if you drop to 70% of your current income. Never get an ARM. Have a deep emergency fund. Never spend retirement money on debt: Go bankrupt first. Be prepared for your investments to lose half their value overnight. Have multiple fungible skill sets.","The job market was ACTUALLY really tight. You know how everywhere you go now, there's help wanted signs?

Not even exaggerating when I say you can draw like 75% of our current political culture from that.,I was 38 years old and the head chef of a fine dining restaurant. I had enough money saved up for the downpayment on a house by 2007 but didn't buy one since it seemed like the real estate market was in a bubble.   When the financial crisis hit the news our sales dropped by a third immediately. We almost went out of business. We laid off a bunch of our employees. The owner started waiting tables during lunch and lived on tips because the restaurant wasn't generating any income. I had to take a pay cut from $52k a year to $34k. Nobody was hiring and we would have gone out of business otherwise. I was cooking from open to close 13 out of every 14 days to save on hourly labor. We still bounced payroll every week for months.  We made it through the crisis. I ended up not buying a house because my job wasn't secure enough. A few years later we closed because we couldn't get out from under the debt we accrued during the crisis. It took me 8 months to find another head chef job because I was considered over qualified for 99% of the cooking jobs out there. I ended up spending all of my savings on living during that period.   It took until after the pandemic for the cooking pay scale to return to where it was before the crisis. I still live in a one bedroom apartment but have a respectable IRA balance.,Exactly this. I used to joke that if I ever got fired I could find three more jobs on my drive home. It went from that to you couldn‚Äôt really find a job in a matter of a few weeks to months.
investing,May,1d4e663,"At 35, can you retire with a mini job with 1 million?","My friend exercised his option and is taking a break from working. He‚Äôs entertaining the idea of investing and saving and taking a hobby job.  Do you think it‚Äôs possible with the help of a consultant to distribute his assets for both retirement and secure his previous lifestyle at 85,000 per year?  To me the math doesn‚Äôt make sense. 7% return is considered a good year, so asking for 8.5% is unrealistic and also if he was taking 85k out each year then the inflation would erode his ability to reinvest?",‚ÄúMini job‚Äù is an actual big salary for some lmao,"&gt;secure his previous lifestyle at 85,000 per year?  This is the key phrase. What do you mean, exactly?  If he has been earning 85k/yr before taxes, and saving a substantial amount, then he was probably living on a much lower number and could absolutely retire and maintain that.  If he literally wants to spend 85k in after tax dollars every year, then even just assuming a minimal 15% cap gains tax, he needs to get 100k/year. Do the math on the investment returns plus job income and deduct taxes.  It is appealing to say you can average 9%/yr, and this is true. But that requires heavy focus in volatile assets like stocks. The success of the plan depends not just on the average return, but the chronological timing of the good years and bad years. Bad years at the start means it won't work out, even if, on average, the returns are better than 9%.  Don't use simple X%/yr calculators. Use calculators that account for volatility. You want Monte Carlo style simulation.",What is this a job for ants?,"He could probably reliably pull $20-$30k/year from $1m so he got a ‚Äúmini job‚Äù paying $65k, sure he could replicate the lifestyle","Don't forget, he's gonna have a mini-job. Whatever that is.",No. You need a whole lot more than a million to get 85k in today‚Äôs dollars annually for life. Basic rule of thumb for retirees is to pull about 4% a year and those people have at least 30yrs less life than your friend.,"The 4% Rule assumes a 30-year retirement, but has been used by FIRE folks as a guideline for longer retirement periods, with the understanding that greater flexibility both with withdrawal strategy and with part-time (or even full-time) work may be necessary.  Using the rule, your friend could withdraw $40,000 from that $1 million portfolio in his first year of retirement, and adjust that amount for inflation each year thereafter. If his COL is $85K, then he needs to make up the remaining $45K (I'm assuming all figures are net of taxes) with other income, such as the ""hobby job.""  The most likely scenario is that during a market downturn, when his portfolio value declines, he will need to return to full-time work to avoid drawing down the portfolio assets when asset prices are depressed. If he continues to draw from the portfolio during such a downturn, he is introducing serious sequence-of-returns risk into the portfolio and crippling the ability of the portfolio value to recover when the market rebounds. In other words, withdrawing that same $40K from the portfolio when it's dipped in value to $600K means selling more shares, which means there will be far fewer shares remaining in the portfolio when the market recovers, which means his portfolio will suffer a permanent loss of capital unless he replenishes it with new contributions from earned income.  I would suggest your friend read about FIRE strategies and maybe talk with folks at r/Fire before committing to this approach. The folks who typically retire early on a $1 million portfolio do so with a cost of living much less than $85K/year.",He‚Äôs 35 with a million in the bank. ¬†It‚Äôs probably a 20-30 hour a week job that is less stressful than what they have been doing.,"It sounds like he's looking to either /r/coastFIRE, which is getting comfortable a job that pays all of the bills, usually a part time job, or /r/baristafire, which is getting a job that doesn't pay all of the bills but pays most of the bills, usually a seasonal job.  Using the 4% rule 1mm turns into 40k a year.  If his living expenses are 85k a year he needs to make a minimum of 45k a year or he needs to downsize his expenses.","Big salary for some, but also, barely getting by, which tells you how bad it is"
investing,May,1d4m37d,"Help me understand how the rich use ""loan"" loopholes to avoid taxes","So I keep hearing this narrative that billionares are to avoid taxes by taking out loans against their stock. I have some questions about how this mechanism actually works.   1. In order to pay of the loan, don't they need to eventually sell their stock? Aren't there gains taxed at this point? 2. Aren't they losing money in this transaction by needing to pay interest on the loan? Why would banks agree to loan out money for low interest rates to a billionare? What do they gain from this?  3. This whole trasaction is a huge gamble anyway right? Say the value of their collateral stock suddenly fell. Wouldn't they now be stuck paying paying additional interest on a loan principle, while not having the collateral to pay the loan back.  4. How much money/stock does someone need to use this strategy effectively. 1m, 10m, 100m... or does it really only apply when you are dealing in the billions.      If someone has a good resource to explain this please link it to me. I tried looking up some videos to explain this, but they all feel like AI generated click bait nonsense (example https://youtu.be/romlLCtU0QQ).   Some claims this video made that sounded strange:   * Bezos avoid 40M in income taxes by showing that he spent more than that in bussiness expenses.     * This just sound like a regular bussiness tax write off that any bussiness owner could and would do. Its only possible if he is honestly re-investing his personal money back into his own bussiness right?  * Elon would have to pay 120B a year in taxes if he was taxed fairly     * This claim also sound irrational. Given his net worth is roughly \~200b  * Billionares get favoral loans from banks at rates of 1%.     * This claim might be true, but I don't see what a bank would stand to gain by giving out 1% interest rate loans to billionares. Wouldn't the bank get better returns by investing that cash in nearly any other asset?","&gt;In order to pay of the loan, don't they need to eventually sell their stock? Aren't there gains taxed at this point?  No.  They can always take out another loan to pay back the first loan; and all they need to sell is enough to cover the *interest* on the loan; but they can probably even roll that into a new loan if needed.  &gt;Aren't they losing money in this transaction by needing to pay interest on the loan? Why would banks agree to loan out money for low interest rates to a billionare? What do they gain from this?  The argument is that the underlying asset will grow more faster than the cost of interest and capital gain taxes (23.8% federally)  &gt;This whole trasaction is a huge gamble anyway right? Say the value of their collateral stock suddenly fell. Wouldn't they now be stuck paying paying additional interest on a loan principle, while not having the collateral to pay the loan back.  This is correct; but if you have shares with $500,000,000; you'd probably easily find a bank to give you a $5,000,000 loan.

My parents have absolutely no experience investing and Im frankly the only person I know who is looking into this. Am I already investing in the market? How is it accumulating interest? Do I have to purchase stocks separately within the app? If so, how can I buy into the S&amp;P 500? Who am I? Whats going on? What is life?","An IRA stands for an Individual Retirement Account. It‚Äôs basically a bucket where you can put money with special advantages conferred by the government.  There are other kinds of buckets with special advantages ‚Äî you may have heard of a 401k. This bucket is *only available* through an employer, so you must: be an employee, ¬†your employer must *offer* it as a benefit, and it can only be funded* through ¬†the money you‚Äôd normally get paid in your paycheck.  Because not everyone has access to a 401k, the government created the IRA ‚Äî that‚Äôs what the ‚Äúindividual‚Äù means in the IRA.  Since these are just buckets, inside the bucket the money can sit as cash, it can be invested in stocks or bonds, and other things.  Ok so now what are the special government advantages that makes these attractive? They have to do with how they interact with taxes.  There are two flavors of both an IRA and a 401k ‚Äî traditional and Roth. The difference between the two is **when** taxes are taken out, because the government always needs taxes.¬†  In a *traditional* treatment, the government pretends that the money you put into the bucket was never paid to you. This means that you don‚Äôt pay taxes on it in the year you made that money. Instead, you *defer* paying taxes on it until the year that you take money from the bucket. So eg if your salary is 90k and you put 5k into a traditional bucket, when you file your taxes the government says you actually made 85k that year. Now when you take out that 5k when you‚Äôre 70 (and hopefully it‚Äôs been invested and is now grown into way more than just 5k), **that is considered part of your income** and you pay taxes on it along with the rest of your income.  In a Roth bucket you pay taxes on the money in the year you put it into the bucket. So the government says you made 90k. But then when you're 70, you don‚Äôt need to pay taxes on what you withdraw.",It needs to be invested in something inside the account. So buy something like the etf VTI. This is a total market index.,Yes but limits apply to both. $7000 annual contribution limit combined between the two.,Can you open both a traditional and a Roth IRA?,"A Roth IRA is a retirement account in which you put money after taxes have been paid.  There are no tax benefits today but the money grows tax free and there are no taxes paid upon withdrawal unlike a traditional IRA or traditional 401k.  You must wait until age 59.5 to withdraw any dividends or earnings or there is a penalty.  However, you can withdraw your contribution at any time.","That's important. Lots of people mistakenly believe IRAs are an investment in and of themselves. (It doesn't help that banks sometimes market their [time deposit accounts](https://www.wellsfargo.com/investing/retirement/ira/select/destination/rates/) as IRA CDs.) Like a 401K or brokerage account, the IRA is just a container. Once your money is in the container you can invest it [almost](https://www.trustetc.com/blog/what-you-cant-invest-ira/) however you want.  The tax bureau doesn't even care that much what happens while the money is in your IRA, they're mainly watching how much goes in and comes out.",Yep! Lets say I make $250k now and in retirement I expect I'll need to take withdrawals to cover $90k in expenses. You'd save ~32% in taxes this year and your effective tax rate on 90k is 13.4%.,"Roth IRA  Pay tax now, put money in IRA, invest into stocks, money grow, all money taken out when old no need to pay tax",So is the idea for a traditional IRA that your taxes will be lower when you retire due to being in a lower income bracket? I'm not sure I understand how deferring the taxes saves you money overall if you still have to pay them eventually.,"There is also an upper income limit for roth IRAs. If you make more than 161 single / 240 jointly, you cannot contribute."
investing,May,1cyx3s0,So many people don't know how inflation works,"Just a rant here. Whenever I'm scrolling through non-financial subreddits, especially the car subreddits, I find it amazing that so many people have a very poor grasp of how monetary supply, debt, and inflation works. All I read is about greedy corporations, greedy dealers and misplaced anger. Did people suddenly develop more greed in the past 5 years? Did dealers just figure out that you can charge more for a car and make more profit? Or was it the $5 trillion dollars in circulation that was created out of thin air in the past 5 years that was somewhat responsible?  Granted, there's an emotional and psychological component to inflation and no one really knows for certain how monetary policy will actually play out but it's so crazy to think most people just blame it on greed of some people rather than these large policies causing the effect.","There seems to also be an idea that prices will revert (drop) indicating inflation is then lower. Inflation can go to 0.00001% and prices are not dropping. You need deflation for prices to drop.  So you might hear ""Inflation is at the highest point ever"" when it is not.  Though it would be more correctly to say ""prices are at their highest point ever"" since prices can be at their highest point ever even with low inflation.","Same thing in my country (Netherlands). News headline: inflation down from 12% to 4%. Comments under news article: ""But why aren't prices going down then??""",But dealers were absolutely throwing ridiculous market adjustments on cars.,"Yeah, OP doesn't really know what they're talking about. Car prices had everything to do with supply chain shortages (especially chips) which constricted supply as we were coming out of the pandemic and demand was feverish. It has nothing to do with monetary policy, and everything to do with the most basic laws of commerce.","&gt;Whenever I'm scrolling through non-financial subreddits  I have some bad news for you friend, most of the people in financial subreddits also don't understand how inflation or other basic financial concepts work.    Even here you'll often see people very confidently throwing criticism at basically everything they don't like, stimulus checks, PPP loans, Federal reserve actions, etc.    But in economics the strong consensus is that inflation was pretty squarely a supply shock/disturbance issue.    https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2022/English/wpiea2022208-print-pdf.ashx  https://www.nber.org/digest/20239/unpacking-causes-pandemic-era-inflation-us  https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/global-inflation",My income hasn't changed though.,"broadly speaking even in financial subreddits financial literacy is low, including your post.   Inflation as a financial metric is a calculation. Basically change in cost of basket of goods, but that doesn‚Äôt really explain *why* the basket of goods changed prices.   Greed could be one component. Raw material, shipping expense, rent, wages etc all contribute","From your post and your blame on the ""$5 trillion out of thin air"" it seems you are also not very well educated in economics and have an extremely narrow, America-centric view about inflation and the economy   And honestly thats ok b/c its truly super complicated",Good point. Price fixation is a fascinating psychological concept. I don‚Äôt care if a cup of coffee is 99 cents or $5 or $50 as long as my income has changed equally.,"You‚Äôre partially right but not fully. Corporations have always been profit motivated (true) but in normal times raising prices too fast can result in demand falling enough to offset the price increase. When there is a supply shock, corporations can raise price because more people are chasing fewer goods. It‚Äôs also easy to justify a price increase because ‚Äúour costs went up‚Äù. When the supply shock goes away though, corporations realize customers have now gotten used to the new price and so they are slow to reverse the changes.  Of course looser monetary policy also drives interest rates down, making it easier to borrow and thus increasing demand.¬†  So they are both to blame."

Right now futures pricing reflects that the market already doesn't expect a cut until September and even then is a mixed bag so this isn't really a very controversial statement.","I'm fully expecting zero cuts until there's a reason to cut, not just the absence of a reason to keep it raised. As long as jobs are stable, inflation is above 2-2.5%, and the economy is able to shift and maneuver how it needs to satisfy national goals, I'm assuming rates will remain elevated. We had our soft landing, enjoy it. I MIGHT expect cuts as inflation reliably approaches 2-2.5%, but when it's over 3%, I think they are just waiting. Too much good is still happening, not enough bad to cause worry. Just my two cents, not an expert.","Inflation is &gt;1% above target and the market says September as if 4 months is some hyper conservative projection. This after it said we'd have cuts in 2023.  The market is so addicted to QE that it snorts hopium every month. When cuts do happen, it'll be because inflation is down because people aren't buying because they don't have jobs. This time is not different.","&gt; This after it said we'd have cuts in 2023.  So I mean, I'll echo a comment I made below, conditions change over time and with it so does outlook.

What's your preferance here, that the Fed took a point in time look in February of 2022, set up a trajectory of rate hikes/cuts, then ignored any subsequent data from then on out?  Obviously not.    Also, Waller is a governor of a regional Fed bank, each governor will have a slightly different take and outlook with some being more dovish and some more hawkish.

investing,May,1cz4w0b,Wealthy (but you can't spend it),"I'm wondering how many of us feel like this.  I was poor when young, living paycheck to paycheck.  Over the years I've saved, have money in retirement, brokerage, college funds for kids...I'm financially secure.  But the closer I get to retirement the more I save, resulting in a situation that looks awfully similar to being paycheck to paycheck.  There's money there, but if you spend it, it's gone.  So what is wealthy?  To me, wealthy is you can spend money on something and you won't miss it.  If I have to remove money from investments to pay for something, it hurts.  I've damaged my nest egg.  I don't know if I'll ever feel like I'm actually wealthy, save for winning the lottery.  Over the years I have watched people in astonishment, people that view money differently.  Expensive cars, lavish vacations, season tickets to sports.  From a lifestyle perspective they are wealthy.  So is that wealthy?  I'm just genuinely curious how people perceive wealth.  Is it a number in your accounts?  Or is it the big house and the fast car?","&gt;To me, wealthy is you can spend money on something and you won't miss it. If I have to remove money from investments to pay for something, it hurts.  To me, wealthy is amassing sufficient assets to cover my living expenses, at my desired ""quality of life"" (always a loaded term) for as long as I draw breath, and to leave a generous estate for my children. At that point, I am financially independent, and I will withdraw from my portfolio to fund that quality of life and enjoy all of the time with family and experiences that money provides for. I couldn't care less about sports cars and celebrity lifestyles. So I suppose it's largely a matter of perspective. The higher the cost of your lifestyle, the more assets you need to feel wealthy. Happiness is matching your assets to your liabilities in an attainable and sustainable way.  We spend most of our lives trading away time to collect money. It would be a shame if, in our waning years, we felt shame or guilt for trading away money to collect time -- time with family, friends, and to live experiences.","There's a bit of an [ant and grasshopper](https://read.gov/aesop/052.html) vibe here. If someone is spending on a lavish lifestyle without saving for the future, they're really living beyond their means -- even if their bank balance isn't going negative.  To me, wealth is security of lifestyle. I don't buy lavish things, but I can buy everything I actually want right now, and continue to do so indefinitely. Thus, I consider myself wealthy though I don't even own a car, let alone a fancy one. Part of it is tempering what you want, of course. It's a bit of a Buddhist idea, that the root of unhappiness is not in missing out on things you want, but the wanting of those things in the first place.  When I was a teenager I met a couple who'd retired early (in their 50s) to live off their investments. I asked the secret and was told ""we don't like *spending* money, we like *having* money"".

So the number beside each level is total net worth.  That includes mortgage debt and all encompassing.     1. Positive net worth.  2. (50k) No debt or minimal like mortgage so we don‚Äôt ever have to think about paying bills and if we will make it. 3.  (200k) We don‚Äôt need to think about menu prices when going out 4.  (400k) We get to buy the vehicle we want with cash (currently I drive 90‚Äôs pickup and she a 2000‚Äôs jeep GC) 5.  (500k) We get to buy the house we want. 6.  (750k)Don‚Äôt have to think about vacation total cost or how many we can take.  7. (1M)Passive income surpasses regular income.  We could force 4 and maybe 5 right now but we‚Äôd never hit 6.  The way we run our finances is a reward system.  Our finances are completely combined but we each have a ‚Äúfun‚Äù account that we can just spend without asking the other.  The deposit into that account is based on $50 per level we are at.  So right now we get $150 a month.  Right now we are at stage 3 and about to pass into stage 4 I feel in the next year.  It‚Äôs kind of based on net worth.    Man it has done wonders for her to understand money and how saving is important.  She was not raised with any financial education and her dad made over 100k her whole life so she always had nice things. She really didn‚Äôt understand when I said ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt afford that‚Äù when we had money in the bank.  Like when we first married we had a negative net worth but our (my) brokerage accounts had $60k in them.  She wanted to use that money to ‚Äústart a family‚Äù and get a telluride for her car, and move from my 1200sq/ft house.  Now she is content in the house and her jeep.  She blows every cent of fun money and money she makes on the side on stitch fix, but that‚Äôs her choice.  She is excited about us hitting level 4 and asks about our finances every month or so when she used to never ask and hated when I talked to her about what I was doing with our money!","My theory is this, you do enough for your kids that they can do something, but not enough where they can do nothing.","&gt; wealth is security of lifestyle  &gt; ""we don't like spending money, we like having money""  That wealth is like a reservoir that's filled with water.

You can explain a reservoir and its purpose to any random person and they would totally get it, and understand why they should not be having firehose fights anytime soon. But if you try to explain why people should conserve and grow their money and not spend lavishly, you'll get wildly different answers."

For much of the past decade, Apple has been the most profitable and most valuable U.S. company, occasionally trading places with Microsoft, the 2nd most profitable U.S. company.  Which brings us to the current situation. Microsoft is worth $3.2 trillion; Apple is worth $2.9. Microsoft is actually making slightly less profit than Apple but has a shown a higher earnings growth trajectory in recent quarters/years. NVIDIA is worth $2.8 and making about a tenth of MS &amp; Apple‚Äôs profits, but might double or triple its earnings this year. One of 3 things can happen:  1) NVIDIA takes #1 and grows into its valuation  2) NVIDIA takes #1 then loses it because it fails to grow into its valuation  3) Wall Street pumps Apple &amp; MS stock higher so this never becomes an issue  It should be noted the last time the most valuable company did NOT make the most profits, that was Cisco in the early 2000s ‚Ä¶ and it didn‚Äôt end well.","It's not an issue of ""highest"", and MSFT and AAPL are irrelevant.

investing,May,1cj9veh,Do valuations even matter anymore for US stocks?,"More money is now in passive funds than active funds. Passive money doesn't care about valuations, it just blindly flows into the stock market based on existing company market caps.  Every two weeks, billions of dollars in retirement contributions flows into passive index funds. There's an ever greater supply of money flowing into passive instruments year by year and it doesn't care one bit about, say, NVDA being overvalued, it's going to buy NVDA based on it's current market cap relative to the rest of the market.  Moreover, the stock market is essentially a federally protected asset. Most Americans are relying on their portfolios to fund their retirement and so there's a case to be made that the federal government would always step in to avert a catastrophic crash. We could see future 50% crashes but at that point the government would step in and support the market somehow.  In such an environment, are metrics like CAPE ratios and P/E ratios still useful?","Valuation matters and will continue to matter for individual stocks.  You're right that passive money doesn't care about individual stocks, but there are still many active investors.

investing,May,1csafr6,My wife is learning to accept that investing is important‚Äîhere is where she‚Äôs at.,"My wife grew up in a family in the middle of nowhere. Where they (her family) never invested. They always kept cash. Everything.   The idea of investing to her was (and still is to certain extent) very scary. I have a finance background, so I‚Äôve been encouraging her to consider. We‚Äôve sat down, and looked at inflation rate, and cost of living stuff, and both of us agree that just ‚Äòsaving cash‚Äô is not enough (I knew the answer, but I needed to help her to come to that conclusion). Again, keep in mind she‚Äôs not really a risk-taker, but the fact that she‚Äôs willing to do it, is a huge growth for her and I‚Äôm proud of her. She did her own research, and for her Roth IRA, this is what she has decided.  1. FXAIX (Sp 500-Fidelity) 2. FBGRX (Blue chip growth-fidelity) 3. FTBFX (Total Bond Fund-fidelity)  She even asked me to write this on here, to hear people‚Äôs thoughts.  My position: I think, to start off, I don‚Äôt see a problem starting off like this. Once she starts seeing the money do its thing, I believe she will lean more into investing throughout the months.   So, thoughts on her choice of funds? Why or why not given her risk tolerance.","&gt; FBGRX (Blue chip growth-fidelity)  I would definitely not do this one. It's got almost a 0.5 ER and it's just concentrating you in stocks you already hold in FXAIX. It's exposing you to concentration risk, which you can't expect to be compensated for in the long term.   The way to avoid concentration risk is to diversify and to just do total stock market index funds. FSKAX or FZROX for US stocks and FTIHX or FZILX for international stocks. Anywhere from 60/40 to 80/20 for the equities portion of your portfolio.   But yeah, assuming she's got both FXAIX and FBGRX in her portfolio it means a *huge* percentage of her wealth would be tied up in just a small handful of companies in the same country and in the same economic sector... which seems like a bad idea for a risk averse person!   &gt; FTBFX (Total Bond Fund-fidelity)  There's a cheaper version of this one: FXNAX.  But honestly, I'd skip both and go for FUAMX and/or FNBGX. Both FXNAX and FTBFX hold a lot of corporate bonds which are riskier than US treasuries and are also pretty highly correlated with the stock market (as in, corporations tend to default on their loans when the stock market crashes). So US treasury bonds are a safer hedge.",That's a great start. Just keep her away from Wallstreetbets.,"If your wife is young, put everything into FXAIX and just let it sit.

The worst bear market **for bonds** in history.",The last few years are a terrible way to evaluate bond funds since we had ridiculously low interest rates for a long time and then the last 2 years have been the worst bear market in history.

And it's quite stable -- which is the point.  I'd add that right now FUAMX has a yield of just under 5% and should be expected to rise in price if the fed drops interest rates.,Her age matters. And the percentages of each fund.,"FUAMX - Why would you choose this fund? The 10 year yield is for all purposes flat, and the 12 month distribution is below inflation.   You literally lose purchasing power investing in this fund.","You guys are working together and coming to agreement on your goals and methods which puts your marriage far ahead of a lot of others. This is a key to success and happiness in a lot of aspects of life - not just personal finance.   I didn't grow up in a household that invested but I learned about it in highschool and college. When I graduated and started my career, I started investing. My wife had solid personal finances with emphasis on budgeting and saving, but never really thought about investing. But it didn't take much effort for her to learn about investing and the risk/reward tradeoff of various asset classes (cash, bonds, stocks). She quickly accepted that we would be better off in the long run by taking on more risk.   We're 50 years old now. Early in our marriage we experienced a few +30% return years at the end of the tech bubble. These were probably a good experience because it led to a lot of excitement to see such large gains and hooked us on investing. But these years were followed by the tech crash, 9/11 recession, great financial crisis of 2008. It wasn't an easy thing to look back at 10 years with no market gains. If we had experienced this immediately after starting it could have shaken our confidence. But we stuck to our strategy and kept putting money in thinking ""what else can we do"" and ""we're in this for the long term"". When the market did recover and grow, our money was multiplied. We're looking at early retirement soon and our wealth is about 2/3 market returns and 1/3 money we put in the account. I can't imagine if we had only saved money in cash accounts, especially through decades when interest rates were below inflation!   I think showing the math on future expected wealth with inflation, cash, bonds, stocks is a great start. It's pretty easy to see the benefits of investing long term. But you should also think about how you will feel and react during a bear market. Understand that you will inevitably experience a big market decline at some point and that it won't be a fun experience. Reach agreement now that when this happens, you won't cast blame, or feel despair, or second guess your decision. Market declines are fully expected and normal. So just stick to your long term strategy that you've agreed on together.",Exactly !  No reason to own bonds if you‚Äôre under 50 years old.

ETFs can be sold on the spot so if you need to be able to sell quickly they are much better than mutual funds which might take days or worse.

It‚Äôs a highly consolidated industry with only a few dominant players, and those players effectively have local monopolies over certain areas. They are the best way to transport many categories of large freight across land. By owning a railroad business, you effectively get a cut of the value of all goods transported across North America, which has tended to become more valuable over time. This is a recent-ish phenomenon - with a few opportunities arising around 2006 - 2010. The railroad industry was a lousy place to invest when there was more competition. Of course, now everybody knows about these things, so it doesn‚Äôt necessarily represent an investment opportunity, although it might. You‚Äôd have to research it.","Also replacement value is probably in the trillions. The likelihood of a new competitor is so low. The only way these railroads were built out was from free land, cheap debt and equity from 200 years ago, and cheap migrant workers.  The right of way, is prob in the hundreds of billions.

This current allocation could change in the future, but for the next 15 years this will be as is.    Is it realistic to expect an average return of 7% ? Or is it too high or too low of an expectation ?",Average? Probably.   I wouldn't count in it as a minimum return though.,Maybe not assume minimum 7% is guaranteed but it's easily a reasonable assumption for 15 years.  CAGR from 2018 is about 10.5% which is right in line with history.  Plus inflation we can easily beat 7%.  **We're talking 15 years here...** If you're this pessimistic you shouldn't even be in equities.,"10% is the nominal rate, not taking inflation into account.  7% is the real rate, which does take inflation into account.  Since there's basically no point in worrying about non-inflation-adjusted numbers - you care about spending power, not however many dollars that translates into - you should be using an inflation-adjusted return rate for future value projections.","Historically the S&amp;P 500 has averaged around 7-10% per year, so you're in the right ballpark. The 10% in FSELX is a bit more aggressive but has strong potential given the tech sector's growth. The 5% in VT gives you a bit of global exposure, which can help balance things out.  Just keep in mind that staying invested and not reacting to short term market fluctuations will be key to achieving that long term average.","Depends on what you mean by ""expect.""  It would not be very surprising if it happened.  But if you make plans based on it, you better have a good backup because the S&amp;P500 might be at 5000 in 2034 or 2039.    I believe the current (high) CAPE puts expected real returns between 3-4%.  Some people have some issues with this metric, but nobody should be surprised either if this happens.",The 10.5% is with inflation. You're talking \~7% when adjusting for it; not the other way around.,You think outperforming globally is MORE likely to continue?  I'd guess outperformance is more likely to lead to mean reversion.,~7% nominal is ~4.5% real.   I hope you're right and expectations are exceeded. Its always easier to be surprised in that direction than the other.,You're exposed heavily to US equities. VT is 64% in North America (incl Canada).

This article has some good info on withdrawal rates for a poprtfolio in retirement: [https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/good-news-safe-withdrawal-rates](https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/good-news-safe-withdrawal-rates)  See the chart in that article titled: 30-Year Starting Safe Withdrawal Rate %, by Asset Allocation  From that chart, a 0% equities portfolio (all bonds) can safely withdraw 6.7% of the portfolio, per year, for 15 years. So with 220K starting, that is about $14.5K per year. You adjust the 14.5K up by inflation each year. So if inflation is 10% in year two you would be 14.5 + 1.45 = 15.95K (in year two). I use 10% inflation to make the math easy -- hopefully we never see that. But basically it is 14.5K per year keeping the same purchasing power over time. So, that is what they have to work with using 'conventional' strategies as outlined in that article where you want a 90% probability it lasts 15 years. You can also see columns for 10 years and 20 years, etc. if you want to plan for a shorter or longer life spans.  Mix in some equities and you can (historically) take out more. But, bonds are doing pretty well now so equities don't add as much as you might think (at least according to that article). Back to VTWNX as an example: It is 40% stock and 60% bonds. According to the chart, for 15 year life, your starting number is 6.8% of the portfolio. Not a big jump (0.1%) over an all bond portfolio yet with more risk. A 10% equities and 90 bonds actually has a higher withdraw rate at 6.9%. (Bonds returns are pretty nice right now.)","At that age, no matter how healthy they are, they should strongly consider something low risk like CDs, treasuries, or HYSA","Just put it in a money market if they don't need it today.

investing,May,1ctd3aq,What are everyone's thoughts on the current optimism on wallstreet?,"I feel like no matter what news come up, the S&amp;P goes up no matter what for the last months. Inflation is nowhere under control but thanks to Jerome Powell talking about lowering rates in December ridiculous amounts of rate cuts were priced in throughout the last months. These have, however, been mostly priced out but current relatively high rates are probably about to stay for a while. Is anyone else weary about this situation?       Inflation is still high, even higher in the last months if one annualizes them. It does not look as optimistic to me as current market trends seem to view the situation. I know, timing the market is super difficult or near impossible and I do not intend to do wait for a crash or a correction but I am more hesitant than I would usually be. I invest new money monthly, however, I am interested to hear what other people make of the current situation and with their cash positions.","&gt; Inflation is nowhere under control  Historic average for inflation is 3.1%. CPI has been around 3-3.5% for the last 2 years. Without OER, which we know is coming down, it's around 2%. The only real concern is that inflation will reaccelerate for some reason. But every day seems to bring news quelling that concern. Meanwhile, the labor market remains strong and the economy remains healthy. This is about as good of a scenario as anyone could have hoped for. And the fact that we're getting no rate cuts for now is, in a weird way, a good thing. That's happening because the economy is so strong the Fed is able to leave rates high.","It's become clear most people don't understand inflation. Lower inflation does not mean prices go down, it just means prices raise more slowly. The Fed doesn't really want prices to reverse, at least not in any significant way.  So we'll continue to see people say the inflation numbers are lies because prices are still higher than 2019. Sigh.","Inflation has dropped from almost 10% to around 3%, how is that ""still high""?","Yeah, no one wants to say it out loud yet, but the soft landing appears to happening.","Exactly, the point is inflation is coming down AND the Fed still has cuts in its back pocket if we need them.

Shoot, even on Tuesday, there were so many people talking with great confidence how CPI was going to be in so hot and all this short rally would dump. It's fine to make guesses but to talk out of your ass like you know everything is ridiculous. If I had been listening to them all these years, my portfolio would be way down.

It's a matter of setting a budget that will allow you attain your long term goals and then sticking to that. So you contribute your 15%/$500 a month if that's what you picked and that comes out of your budget like your rent or mortgage payment does. Also in the budget you would have other necessary expenses.   You should probably have a few months ""emergency fund"" in a cash equivalent (not under a mattress, but a secure but interest paying instrument), this helps a lot with not stressing too much about the possibility of a significant financial hit like losing your job, if you have 3-6 months expenses in cash you won't have to sell your investments when they are possibly down as well.  Beyond that you have some portion of the budget for ""fun"" and discretionary spending. On the one hand the more you put away when you are younger the more compounding is going to work on that but on the other hand you need to enjoy your life while you're living it.

investing,May,1cn3uwt,When do you take out gains from long-term investments?,"I‚Äôve recently started investing into ETFs (like S&amp;P500) as part of a long term investment strategy (in addition to other long term investment plans).   I understand that things like real estate and dividends provide passive income, but investing into things like the S&amp;P doesn‚Äôt. At some point I will need to sell my stocks get back the money earned.   I was wondering what the strategy of selling these looks like for most people.   Is it - Get to pension age, sell everything and put it into something less volatile / passive income? Slowly sell it for daily needs when you stop working? Something different?  Do some of y‚Äôall not wait for it to grow in the next 30-40 years and instead take some profit out every so often to ‚Äúlock in the gains‚Äù?  Honestly I have only heard about investing in the stock market, but never what to do with these investments.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated!","you sell it down as you need the cash to exchange for goods and services, but not before then and never to ""lock in gains"" before you need the money, that would be foolish.  leave it invested as long as possible.  Sell in small amounts as needed. If you want to begin to add a fixed income product for more stability and income as you age, you certainly can. Bonds add ballast but are not as tax efficient.","Are you investing for retirement? Some investors have different investment ""buckets"" for different things like retirement, house, new car, etc.   Many people start out with most/all in stock funds/ETFs like the S&amp;P 500 when they're young. As they get older they start transitioning some into passive income investments. There is not necessarily a point where you sell all your equity (stock) investments. Your investment portfolio grows over the years  I'm in my 70s and still have some money in the stock market.  I'm retired in the US so I get social security every month. I also withdraw from my own retirement accounts to meet my income needs.","There are times where it would make sense to sell LT gains to ""reset"" the basis. If you see yourself in the 12% bracket and don't have any money to convert to Roth, harvesting gains tax free may make sense. At least to restart the basis in case you have to sell down the road. Never is ""never"" the correct answer with finances.","Incorrect. The S&amp;P500 can provide passive income. You simply sell however many shares you need at the moment. Due to volatility and market conditions, there are constraints on how much you can sell and guarantee the investment will still grow or maintain, but selling shares is the exact same thing as a dividend payment.","Hold it until you need to spend it. S&amp;P500 is an investment you could hold until the day you die (I would diversify with total market fund personally, plus international and perhaps some small-value, but that is a different story).  You can generate tax-efficient ""income"" anytime you want by selling. Don't get sucked into the mental fallacy of thinking you need investments late in life that produce actual income... those larger dividend/distribution yields are just forced sales, nothing more.  Start to hold more cash/bonds/alternatives as you get older if that suits your style, but no need to adjust your equity style at all.",Basically the same rules apply.

When you believe a stock is undervalued, you're saying ""I believe the entire rest of the market, which includes a ton of well-informed professional analysts and investors, is wrong"".  So after you do in fact turn out to be right, there are a few possibilities:  1. You had access to secret information that the rest of the market did not 2. You are in fact smarter than all of the professional analysts and investors 3. It was complete luck  I'm betting #1 is not the case, so we're down to a choice between #2 and #3.

Even VTI, which has thousands of stocks in it, is still like 25% tech stocks, including Microsoft and NVIDIA. It just also has all the other great stocks in the market.   You face two major problems:  - first, you're overexposed to a couple of stocks, which opens you up to a lot of uncertainty and variance. That variance has helped you up until now, but the longer time goes on the more likely it is that your overxposure will bite you.   - second, you're missing out on all the growth elsewhere in the market. If NVIDIA stagnates for two quarters and coca cola booms, you miss out. If microsoft gets hacked and craters, so google and amazon boom, you miss out. If you buy the market, you get a piece of EVERY upswing, while also minimizing the losses of any given downswing.   Finally, you're trying to overthink this. It feels cool and smart to plan asset allocation and to try to build diversification, but you as an individual investor WILL be inefficient, and your inefficiencies will result in not making as much profit as you could. That lost profit will instead be made by the big institutions, eating your lunch. Save yourself time, money, and effort, and buy into large funds like VTI or VOO.","Either you are completely ignoring that a price can be too high for a ""powerhouse stock""     Or you somehow believe you are much smarter than the market and know the price wasn't properly pricing in the POWERHOUSE","Oh shit, 200% in two days!

It means forward expected returns are lower because the market has deemed US large-cap equities to be less risky than they were in the past. This seems like a pretty reasonable bet, especially with how much government/Fed intervention we have seen lately.   What does it mean if they have NOT? Well that means that forward returns are still lower, and we may also be in a bubble and have a huge reversion to the mean ahead of us.  Main point is that this should not be used as support for double-digit equity returns to be here to stay forever, it is actually a sign that those returns were a repricing and that moving forward you won't get nearly as much juice, whether it is because of a huge crash and return to normal, or just a steady (but much smaller) grind up in prices.","Mostly due to different industries.

We have seen the boom and bust cycle enough times that we expect the market to bounce back whenever it crashes. This is partly aided by fiscal/monetary stimulus which has become routine in the event of a crash, and will likely continue because there is immense political pressure to keep 401ks from losing money.  2. Earnings growth is expected to be better than they used to be. There is probably some truth here. Tech companies can grow without building tons of infrastructure.  3.

I saw this stuff posted all over different applicable subreddits.   It is also concerning because you have a 13 day old account with 2 comment karma.  ---  But to answer your question:   Before anything, make sure to open an IRA. This will be particularly valuable to you since your current tax bracket is high. Money that is placed into an IRA will defer income/capital gains taxes until you retire. This means a portion of your investments will be able to grow without the govt taking a giant chunk out.  As far as stocks go, I would avoid picking and choosing winners. 99% of people don't have meaningful insight into how to value a stock/company. Just dump it all on VTI or something similar and forget about it.  The only real estate investment I'd make is your primary residence. Being a landlord can have a huge amount of financial and legal pitfalls. If you have the time and energy though, feel free to go for it.   Crypto is a highly speculative investment. I'd rather just stack more VTI than any crypto coins. But no real harm in allocating a small chunk.","Index funds are stocks.

Just buying the market in the form of an index fund gives you plenty of these companies.","I think it‚Äôs worth thinking more about what you‚Äôre trying to achieve and why.  Is your goal to protect your income should it stop?  Is your goal to invest for long term growth?  It‚Äôs also worth thinking about what time frame your investing for, different scenarios and how quickly you might need the money, also your attitude to risk (how will you feel if your money drops in value short term) and come up with a plan based on this.   If you want to shield yourself from loss of income then it makes sense to build up some cash savings as an emergency fund. My income is variable or subject to stopping for a few months with little notice so I have enough readily accessible cash to achieve this.   If you want to put the money away to grow over a longer term horizon then property or stocks are great. Property is typically more hassle to own and harder to liquidate.  However owning a property you let is an asset as it‚Äôll generate money, owning a second home only you use will only cost you money and not generate any cash flow, but you‚Äôll always have the asset  Why have you picked 20% bonds?  I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre relatively young, so you could lose long term growth doing this but it should be less subject to volatility.   Crypto is typically highly volatile so be prepared for huge fluctuations. If you‚Äôre ok with that and it fits your strategy / goals then go for it.   Personally I have a mix of assets for different purposes‚Ä¶  Cash for emergency fund.   Stock / equities for long term growth but easier to liquidate should I need to (I only invest in global tracker funds as I tried stock picking when I was young and learned I cannot beat the market - I do allocate a small amount to ‚Äòplay money‚Äô but less than 5%).

investing,May,1cie1zb,Some Thoughts on Asset Allocation,"**TL;DR** The equity-bond spread (defined as spread = 1/CAPE - 10Y Treasury Yield) is a measure that shows stocks relative attractiveness compared to bonds. Its this metric, rather than absolute CAPE value, that should be used in making portfolio allocation decisions. Today's spread level corresponds to lower expected outperformance for overweight stock portfolios (i.e., excess returns going from 70% stocks to 80% stocks, for example, are expected to be lower compared to the historical average). It may be wise to hold a neutral or even underweight allocation to equities, given today's valuations.   **Introduction**  As of this writing, first drafted on April 22 2024, the Shiller PE sits at 33.27. Many analysts and investment managers will tell you to fear this number. In his latest memo, Jeremy Grantham says that today‚Äôs price-to-earnings metrics sit in the top 1% of modern history, sounding the alarm for U.S. equity bubble territory.  &gt;Well, the U.S. is really enjoying itself if you go by stock prices. A Shiller P/E of 34 (as of March 1st) is in the top 1% of history. Total profits (as a percent of almost anything) are at near-record levels as well. Remember, if margins and multiples are both at record levels at the same time, it really is double counting and double jeopardy ‚Äì for waiting somewhere in the future is another July 1982 or March 2009 with simultaneous record low multiples and badly depressed margins.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite so simple; it might not be appropriate to look at a single asset class in a vacuum the way that many in the investment community do. Is a 30+ PE high? Objectively, it sounds pretty frothy. If bonds were yielding 10%, I‚Äôd almost certainly say that bonds were more attractive. If they were yielding sub-2% like much of the post GFC decade, it might not be as straight forward. At a Shiller PE in the low 30‚Äôs, we have a very conservative 3% earnings yield (remember, Shiller averages the past 10 years of earnings) before even accounting for earnings growth. One might conclude that stocks have the slight edge in this case.  The point is, we can‚Äôt look at a single valuation metric and make an informed decision. We have to consider valuations of equities against the universe of other asset types.  With this post, my aim is to take a more holistic look at valuations - particularly valuation spreads - and see if we can‚Äôt make investment decisions based on our findings.  **A Simple Visualization**  A great place to start with this analysis, and the place that I started when I first began exploring this topic, is a quick visualization plotting stock yields vs bond yields. By doing so, we can start to form a picture on where we are in respect with history.  [PICTURE](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\_1456,c\_limit,f\_webp,q\_auto:good,fl\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b15d040-8805-40e2-8610-e86bd3729006\_919x521.png)  It‚Äôs important to point out what inferences we might try to gage from this chart.  First, intuition tells us that high earnings yields and high bond yields (as defined by the 10-year treasury, in this case) would lead to high forward equity and bond returns, respectively. So the further right on the plot we are, the higher the future equity returns might be. Likewise, the higher (vertically) the point is, the higher the bond returns should be.  With further inspection, the right most points correspond with the years surrounding the late 1910‚Äôs and early 1920‚Äôs; leading into what has been monikered the roaring 20‚Äôs.  1982 is also highlighted on this plot; which was the kickoff to one of the strongest bond and bull markets in history.  These are in-line with our expectations: high returns happen when yields are high. Duh. Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs more.  More generally, the further up and to the right we are on the aforementioned graph, the better we can expect forward returns to be for a diversified portfolio.  It‚Äôs apt to point out that 2022 was basically the inverse of 1982, having the lowest bond &amp; stock yield combination in the modern era. In fact, the post-GFC era was essentially hugging the lower bounds of both stock and bond yields compared to the pre-GFC era.  We can also start to see a shadow of how bonds and stocks might be related. Perhaps when bonds are yielding higher than stocks, stock returns suffer in relation to bonds. We see that the year 2000 (the dotcom bubble top) had equity earnings yields just over 2% (the lowest in history) while treasuries were yielding nearly 7%. We all know how that turned out.  On that note, one might hypothesize that the spread between stock earnings yields and bond yields might be a predictor on how portfolios perform over time. More on that later.  **Historical Equity-Bond Spreads**  Let‚Äôs first define what the Equity-Bond Spread is:  Equity-Bond Spread = (1 / CAPE) - (10 Year Treasury Yield)  [PICTURE](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\_1456,c\_limit,f\_webp,q\_auto:good,fl\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16dfe181-b315-42a7-b9e4-8e5caf9ebc17\_917x411.png)  Again, the implication is that the higher the equity-bond spread (simply referred to as ‚Äúspread‚Äù moving forward) the more attractive equities are in comparison to bonds (i.e., equity earnings yield of 10% looks more attractive than a 3% bond yield, the spread being 10% - 3% = 7%)  The figure below shows us the historical distributions of equity-bond spreads. Also noted, that today‚Äôs valuations lie in the left side of the distribution.  **Excess Returns**  The goal of this study is to see if we can find some indication on whether the spread between stock and bond yields is predictive of future returns.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to compare a stock heavy portfolio to a bond heavy portfolio. One might argue between something super stock heavy like a 90/10 (stock / bond) vs 60/40. But let‚Äôs first look at complete opposites of the spectrum: 90/10 vs 10/90.  We‚Äôll define ‚Äúexcess return‚Äù as follows:  Excess Return = (10 year annualized return of 90 / 10 portfolio) - (10 year annualized return of a 10 / 90 portfolio)  As an example, in the year 1990, a 90/10 portfolio had a 10 year annualized return of 13.6% while a 10/90 portfolio had a 10 year annualized return of 5.3%, giving an excess return of 8.3%.  Also, in the year 1990, the Shiller PE was 17.05 giving a equity earnings yield of 5.87%. The 10 year treasury yield was 8.21% at that time. This gives a spread of -2.34%.  The point for 1990 is shown on the plot below at (-2.34% , 8.3%).  The red arrow denotes where we are in 2024.  [PICTURE](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\_1456,c\_limit,f\_webp,q\_auto:good,fl\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63adc327-3a59-4d5f-b6e0-1669e17424e0\_920x518.png)  The big takeaway from this plot is that 1) stocks outperform bonds almost always and 2) there is a decent correlation between the equity-bond spread and excess returns. When stocks yield much higher than bonds, stock heavy portfolios tend to do better, in comparison, vs when the spread is low or negative.  But we already knew that stocks typically perform better than bonds. The better assessment might be when to overweight stocks compared to a more traditional portfolio. Or, better yet, when to take the foot off the gas on a stock heavy portfolio. So let‚Äôs do the same exercise, this time comparing a 90/10 to a more traditional 60/40.  [PICTURE](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\_1456,c\_limit,f\_webp,q\_auto:good,fl\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098ab5e5-5dae-4c97-9ce5-bc046747ce1d\_922x521.png)  I‚Äôve left the original 10/90 comparison on the plot for the visualization. As expected, the excess returns, across the board, are less pronounced because we‚Äôre comparing a stock heavy portfolio to a slightly less stock heavy portfolio. But the conclusion is clear. The spread does appear to have an impact on excess returns. In negative spread environments, we‚Äôre not paid nearly as much for the extra risk as when spreads are positive and wide. In highly positive spread environments, excess returns can be in the range of 3 - 5%. Which, we all know, can be very impactful over the long-run.  **Understanding Valuation Drivers**  For bonds, valuation is pretty easy: an investor can purchase a bond for a given yield-to-maturity (although returns on bonds aren‚Äôt quite as simple).  For equities, we should examine the components of the discounted cash flow model.  In the long run, a PE ratio might be estimated as follows (this is the terminal value equation):  PE = (1+g) / (d-g)  Above, ‚Äúg‚Äù is the long run earnings growth rate, and ‚Äúd‚Äù is the discount rate. In the case of price-to-earnings, ‚Äúd‚Äù will be the cost of equity. I won‚Äôt cover these more in depth here because this is a very simplified look, but cost of equity is essentially a measure of risk or the required expected return for the asset.  From this, we can actually glean a lot of useful information.  If the security is considered very safe (ie low risk), the discount rate ‚Äúd‚Äù will be low (since the required rate of return is typically lower for a safe asset). A low discount rate in the equation above will lead to a higher PE ratio.  Conversely, a risky security will have a high discount rate, which will lead to a lower PE.  A high long run growth rate, ‚Äúg‚Äù, will increase the numerator and decrease the denominator, leading to a higher PE for a given discount rate.  From these three ideas, we see that risk and growth are comingled in valuations. Something that‚Äôs low risk and has low earnings growth might actually have the same high PE valuation as something that‚Äôs high risk and high earnings growth. But the expected return will actually be higher for the high risk security.  This all just to say that while PE ratios are related to forward expected returns, they don‚Äôt tell the full story. This is an important caveat to the next section.  **Current Valuations By Asset Classes**  The following data was pulled from Vanguards Website.  VOO = S&amp;P 500 BND = Bond Index  VEA = Developed International VNQ = REITs  VWO = Emerging Markets  [PICTURE](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\_1456,c\_limit,f\_webp,q\_auto:good,fl\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5403de2f-6193-4323-b63e-22e54317d46f\_920x523.png)  This chart isn‚Äôt meant to be used to decide what asset mixture to make your portfolio. Instead, it‚Äôs meant to be used, qualitatively, as a starting point to see what asset mixes might make sense to hold.  Typically, in terms of valuations, the further up and to the right (high starting yield + high earnings growth) on this graph indicates higher predicted forward returns.  But there are trade offs. Namely, this doesn‚Äôt account, directly, for risk. Bonds (BND) is considered ‚Äòrisk-free‚Äô, but it doesn‚Äôt offer any potential for earnings (or coupon) growth. Developed international (VEA) looks attractive compared to the S&amp;P 500 (VOO) on a starting yield basis, but it has offered less earnings growth, and comes with extra baggage in terms of geopolitical risk. But high risk does typically mean higher potential returns. The same goes for Emerging Markets (VWO), but to an even greater extent.  **Does History Have to Look Like the Past**  Something else to consider, especially when looking back at the first couple of sections, is ‚Äúdoes today have to look like the past?‚Äù Do current market environment have stocks overvalued, or is it that historic valuations had stocks inordinately undervalued?  Maybe stocks aren‚Äôt as risky as we first thought. Especially in the U.S., the largest companies might not carry a ton of risk at all. In that sense, maybe it was the early days of modern capitalism that were inefficient, and we‚Äôre now getting to a more balanced regime in terms of valuations, where risk-free bonds yield in the 3-5% range, and slightly riskier stocks return in the 5-7% range. In this case, the current spread environment would make sense, where starting yields are much closer, and the earnings growth potential of stocks makes up the difference in forward expected returns. But this would be all the more reason to hold a diversified portfolio. Why hold only stocks, when stocks and bonds will give a similar range of outcomes.  Stocks also offer other advantages over bonds. Namely inflation protection. If inflation spikes, bonds an investor is currently holding will not only lose value due to rising interest rates, but the purchasing power of the dollars tied to those bonds will decline over time. Stocks are somewhat more resilient in that revenues and earnings (assuming steady margins) will rise with inflation. In this sense, stocks are actually less risky than bonds or cash.  Inflation also affects the spread in another way. The CAPE ratio uses inflation adjusted earnings from the past. What this means is that in a high inflation environment, the CAPE ratio comes down without any correction in price. We saw this in 2022 where the CAPE fell nearly 30% while the S&amp;P 500 only fell 18%. Due to this phenomena, in a high inflation environment, the metrics used above can correct themselves even while equity prices are climbing.  Another potential issue with this study is that accounting standards have changed over time. Earnings today may not be comparable to earnings of the past. I haven‚Äôt explored these potential differences here, but it might be prudent to do so if you were to use this study for actionable advice.  **Conclusions**  **Are we in a Bubble?**  To give Jeremy Grantham a rebuttal (although, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs not asking for one). No, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre in an outright bubble. U.S. markets might be frothy, and forward returns will probably be lower for U.S. stocks, but we‚Äôve seen in the data above that 10 year returns have been fine given any market spread and valuation. Would I be surprised if we had another bear market? No. But I‚Äôd be just as un-surprised if we average 6-8% equity returns for the next decade.  **Asset Allocations**  To me, when presented with the data above, it doesn‚Äôt seem likely that we‚Äôll be rewarded for holding an overweight U.S. equity portfolio. While equities should continue to outperform bonds for the next ten years, if today‚Äôs environment rhymes with history, holding an underweight stock portfolio won‚Äôt cost us much in terms of returns. But it may come with the added benefit of lower volatility and overall risk. An underweight portfolio also still has some potential to outperform. That all seems like a good trade-off.  In addition, international (both developed and emerging) markets have relatively enticing valuations and return prospects. While there‚Äôs no guarantee that either will outperform U.S. equities, they may offer uncorrelated returns that also won‚Äôt drag too much on the overall portfolio.  In general, given the current valuation environment, a balanced portfolio might be the best path forward for risk adjusted returns.  **Citations**  Shiller PE and Treasury Yield Data:  [https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)  Historical Return Data:  [https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/histretSP.html](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html)","&gt; The equity-bond spread (defined as spread = 1/CAPE - 10Y Treasury Yield)  I think Robert Shiller calls this the Excess Cape Yield and he talked about it in a NYT piece in 2020. ([paywalled link](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/business/stock-market-prices-bubble.html ))  He uses the 10 year TIPS to account for differences in inflation. At the time, it was in a more normal range, although now it's dropped quite a bit. Various sites now track this value so you can see its historic range:  https://en.macromicro.me/charts/27100/us-shiller-ecy","More people should understand this. Instead, we have advice telling people with a 2065 Target Date Fund that ""10% bonds is 10% too much"".  Morningstar looked at this from the perspective of allocation for withdrawal rates for retirement. 20% to 40% stock allocation had the highest supported withdrawal rates. See the chart ""30-Year Starting Safe Withdrawal Rate %, by Asset Allocation, 90% Success Rate "" at https://www.morningstar.com/retirement/good-news-safe-withdrawal-rates Where they write:  ""As shown in the table below, we estimate that a new retiree planning for a 30-year time horizon can safely withdraw as much as 4% of the portfolio‚Äôs value as a starting safe withdrawal rate for a portfolio with a 40% equity weighting. Because of the more attractive yields available on fixed-income securities, we found the same figure applies to portfolios with equity weightings as low as 20%.""","I have a portion of my portfolio invested in several active asset allocation strategies. One is a relative valuation strategy similar to what you suggest. I use a different valuation measure than CAPE but that's probably not significant. I use a regression to forecast foward equity returns and compare forecast return to yield. I also apply historical model variance to estimate the probability that equity returns will exceed treasury returns over the next 10 years. I use this probability forecast as the allocation target: 90% probability that equities exceed treasuries gives 90% allocation. I always prefer using a probabilistic approach to set allocation targets in an active strategy. It's much more logical than using a binary allocation that switches from all-in to all-out as soon as it crosses a threshold. Allocation should incorporate confidence in the model which is almost never 100%.   I apply an exponential moving average to the allocation to smooth the changes in allocation to reduce noise, reduce turnover, and slow transition of allocation during valuation transitions so that you're buying too quickly into a declining market, or selling off too quickly in a rising market. Historical backtesting suggest this would have been a very reasonable strategy, especially during the tech bubble period.   It hasn't performed very well in recent years because it has been allocated to about 30% equity, 70% treasuries. Treasuries had worse performance than equities in 2022 and equities have significantly outpaced treasuries during Covid recovery and late 2022-2023. But the performance matched expectations so I wouldn't say anything is wrong with the strategy, it just hasn't been a favorable period for relative valuation (or many other active strategies). The best strategy in recent years has been passive 100% equities, but that's true most of the time.","The equity 10 year forward return forecast comes from a valuation model. The historical error has a standard deviation of 2% (range is -5% to +6%). The bond 10 year forward return forecast is just the 10 year treasury yield. This forecast has a historical error standard deviation of 1.2% (-3.5% to +3.8%).   The expected excess return is the difference between these two forecasts, and the expected standard deviation is the square-root of the sum square standard deviations, sqrt(2.1%^2  + 1.2%^2) = 2.4%. I bump this up to 4% to reduce the ""confidence"" in the forecast. This also somewhat offsets the fact that the model error has significant autocorrelation.   Then I calculate the probability of an forecast excess return actually being greater than 0 subject to a normal distribution of error with 4% standard deviation. Using Excel formulas this would be NORM.DIST(forecast excess return,0,4%,true). The confidence is constant (error standard deviation of 4%) and the probability of positive excess return is a direction function of the level of excess return.","&gt; Yes, but you don't know what future inflation will be.  With TIPS you don't care what the inflation will be, their yield is after inflation. That's why valuation models use TIPS instead of the nominal rate.",[removed],[removed],[removed],"Yeah, it's a little different because he uses inflation adjusted bond yields. So I call it something different.   I don't really like ECY because inflation changes over time. Your ECY at the end of 2022 will be drastically different than the ECY by mid 2023 just because inflation fell. For something that uses rolling averages (in CAPE), I don't think it's appropriate to also tie in something that can change drastically like that.   Also, inflation normalizes where the fed wants (2%). Spikes in inflation mess with the ECY is the short run, but ECY is smooth in the long run, so why even include inflation? It's captured, implicitly, in the data anyways.   You can run the same exercise with ECY, but I don't believe you'll get a better fit on the data.","Yes, but you don't know what future inflation will be. If it's 10% last year, but will be 2% next year, then what number do you use? Using last year's number will make bonds look horrendously valued relative to stocks.

investing,May,1cvhwp6,Can someone explain how compounding works when buying equity stocks?,I've always heard about compounding investing and while I can understand it with say a high interest savings account where say you put $100 in and you get 10% interest in one year and then reinvest that at $110 at another 10% it grows to $121 (compared to just $100 and getting 20% over two years).     But if say I buy $100 of apple stock and it grows 20% in two years and it's valued at $120.  How is that compound investing?  It's not like I'm buying apple stock getting $110 at the end of the year and reinvesting it in apple again and then getting $121 and repeating.  No usually you just buy and you buy that ends up being $120.  So I'm just confused on how the whole compounding works for stocks (let's also say there's no dividends to reinvest either),The business is compounding undernearth.  Apple revenue (illustrative) $100m to $150m to $225m to $300m to $500m  Etc,"If you invest $100, and it goes up 1% that day, you now have $101. If the next day, it goes up 1% again,, you gain 1% of the $101, not the original $100.","Compounding in equities isn‚Äôt from interest. It‚Äôs from asset appreciation. This is a very important distinction.   Interest is paid on a schedule, and at a designated rate. Rates may change, but are declared, so you know what to expect.   Asset value is not on a schedule, and it may go up or down. In the case of stocks/equities, the long term trend has historically been up, with some negative years along the way. On average, the U.S. stock market has a negative year roughly 3 out of every 10 years. 2022 is an example of a negative year.   This distinction is important to understand because it can inform how you decide to allocate your capital. When we say things like, ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt put money in stocks if you‚Äôre going to need it in the next 10 years‚Äù, it‚Äôs because there could be a bear market that cuts down your portfolio at a bad time. However, equities tend to return more over a long period than bonds (this is not guaranteed, at all).","I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree, but that is an entirely separate topic from interest vs asset appreciation.","I think no one is getting what you‚Äôre confused about but I‚Äôll try.¬†  So like you say if Apple goes up 20% from $100 it‚Äôs $120 - and you said there‚Äôs no compounding here you just end up with 20% more.¬†  I think you‚Äôre just missing that there has to be a defined *time* that the % is applied to. Could be a day, could be a year. The growth *rate* is **not** an absolute metric, it‚Äôs periodical.¬†  So there is no compounding the first year (or any arbitrary period). What we mean when we say equites compound is that for the second period, the growth rate is applied to the principal investment + growth achieved in the first period. The growth rate doesn‚Äôt even have to be the same again to compound.¬†  As long as your expressing the growth rate as a percentage, you can average the growth rate (CAGR) over a time period and even if it‚Äôs not the same every period - and the growth will be an exponential curve every time growth is applied as a percentage.","You didn't understand his question. He's asking how compounding works in a situation where he doesn't receive that 20% appreciation to reinvest.    It's a good question, as stock appreciation isn't true compounding the way dividends or interest payments are.","If it grows 20% per year, you don‚Äôt earn 20 dollars every year, you earn more every year because it is interest over interest.   I recommend checking a compound calculator for some visualisation",&gt;Compounding in equities isn‚Äôt from interest. It‚Äôs from asset appreciation.  That's too wide a statement for every company. Some companies are in very established industries where there aren't potential for growth. Many companies return capital back to shareholders via dividends or buybacks. Not every single company is built on expanding their business.,"Investments like stocks don't compound like interests, the mechanic is different. The stocks *grow* in value, instead of you receiving the interest (or dividends) and then reinvesting. In effect you ""reinvest"" the growth by simply doing nothing. Imagine instead that Apple pays $20 in dividends instead of growing share price by $20. Now you have $100 of apple stock and $20 in cash. In order to compound, you'd have to take that $20 and buy more apple stocks, to reinvest. The end result is the same.","I like how everyone's first sentence is ""stocks don't compound like interest"" meanwhile, OP clearly called out that they know how interest compounds.  To stick with your Apple example, let's say on January first of some random year, you bought one share of Apple stock, and let's also pretend that it was $100, for the sake of this example. On December 31st of that same year, one Apple share was worth $110.45, meaning you've earned $10.45. Now we wait another year, and then on December 31st of the second year of investing, one share of Apple stock is worth $121.39. The compound growth, or the compound earnings, in the second year is $10.94."

Because of that I am strong on infrastructure companies like Quanta and MasTec that are working to do this and also creating solar plants / and building O&amp;G pipelines.   Everyone says renewables are the future but the reality is that‚Äôs only a small fraction of what is providing energy to the global market.   Last year, fossil fuel resources were still providing 83% of the world‚Äôs energy needs. O&amp;G is not going away any time soon.","As far as AI energy consumption goes, I wouldn't get too excited about it in terms of investing in energy.   We are pretty early in the AI development period (AI being a shorthand for very large neural network models such as LLMs). I think the main developers of this technology are only just now starting to see what the needs are going to be from the hardware side and we get more into products based on the tech. GPUs that are AI focused were a great starting point, but we didn't really know what the software needed exactly until after GPT took off and subsequent development into a consumable product. Designs for more efficient chips and hardware to take full advantage of large models are starting to emerge. GPUs will probably be a good choice for the next few years, but I expect more energy-efficient chips (look up talks about ""analog chips"" for instance) will emerge in the market, at least on the data center side.  I don't see the energy side being where to invest in AI, I think its probably going to be more around data centers and companies that make great AI-based products.","Businesses in the US and China currently pay approximately half as much for electricity as Europe, the UK and Japan. Until 2002 the US had the lowest cost and China was clustered with the others.   Over the last few years China‚Äôs binge of coal-fired power and RE assets had brought prices down. As the EU, UK and Japan have backed away from fossil fuels their prices have soared. The US under Biden has seen similar but smaller increases.   In think the new and growing importance of energy combined with China‚Äôs new coal fleet with ensure that they can outcompete almost all other developing countries and developed countries except for the US.   I think the US Will eventually have go go back to developing and growing fossil (natural gas) assets. If Trump wins in November this will happen quickly. If Biden does, it becomes much harder.  Energy is back and we still don‚Äôt have many options beyond fossil fuels for the bulk of it. Renewables around the edges are part of the solution.","Except the population of the world seems to have peaked, and population is crashing, especially in the West.

I work in the energy sector and renewables are the hot marketing topic but their uses are going to be limited to remote data centers and other sites that have issues being connected to the traditional electrical grid.",Crude oil stocks are for swing trading.  Requires very good timing.  They are not long-term holds.  The problem with them is that individual companies have little control over global production.  High prices cure high prices and over production resumes.  Even now production are at record levels and stockpiles are rising.  Arguably still supply &gt; demand and it's an OKAY hold at best.,"I don‚Äôt see that it is a U.S. view. It is a survey of electricity prices in major economies.   Your question was ‚ÄúWhat do you think about the energy sector over the next ten years‚Äù. As I said, I think demand for electricity in particular will rise, the US and China will benefit because of lower electricity costs and that this increase in demand will restore the need for fossil fuels in general and US LNG in particular.

investing,May,1d08frq,Still Obsessed with Chip Makers (Part 3),"This is my third quarterly post about chip makers. 6 months ago, SMH was around $160. 3 months ago, it was just under $200. Yesterday, it reached $244. I believe it chips are still a great investment, even at this price, and I am continuing to buy more.  Along the way, many commenters have argued against chips, so this quarter I think I'd like to address the common themes I see in the comments, and explain why I think chips are still a great opportunity.  1. AI is a gimmick, or has very limited practical use, or is just a fancy auto-complete, and it won't drive growth in chips  This is probably the most common and upvoted argument I see. I have to guess that people making this argument either haven't experimented with AI themselves, or don't yet have a use for AI in their day to day lives.  For me, I use GitHub copilot every day. It is an incredible productivity boost. Developers that have used GitHub copilot understand how much value is there, and the rest of the world is just now catching up with things like Microsoft's recently announced Copilot+ (more on that in a minute). So if you want to argue that AI is a gimmick or fad, I'd ask that you also explain why you think millions of people will suddenly stop or decrease their use, rather than increase and expand their use of AI as it continues to get better.  2. We don't need more chips, soon there will be too much supply  Last time I saw this argument, I countered that even as data centers built up their AI capabilities, on-device demands were going to further strain supply. Since then, there have been several announcements about on-device chips, with Copilot+ (and the requirement of a chip that can do 40 TOPS) perhaps being the biggest and clearest example.  Very few devices today (laptops, phones, etc.) have enough processing power, or the right kind of processing power, to efficiently run a small LLM. Hence, the release of new chips like the M4 and the Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite, which were designed specifically to power small on-device LLMs. In my opinion, these chips are going to be a minimum system requirement going forward, and virtually every device will eventually be replaced with one that has one of these new chips.   3. It's a chip bubble, there's no fundamentals supporting the price  I'm a big believer in fundamental analysis, and if you look at chips through the lens of fundamental analysis, I see your point. NVDA is trading at over 60 P/E, and why would you buy that when there are other great companies trading at a much lower P/E.  The thing is, fundamental analysis is great for mature industries that are perhaps innovating on their operations, making them more efficient, but where there is not much actual product innovation. Fundamental analysis really breaks down when you have a rapidly evolving or completely novel product, a product so innovative it creates an all-new industry. For example, if you were thinking about investing in Amazon around 2010, fundamental analysis would have told you that the company is burning through cash, and their P/E ration was in the high 60's, and that it wasn't a good value. Of course, the stock went on to grow by more than 20x since then. So much for fundamental analysis.  Fundamental analysis really falls short when it comes to new products that are so innovative they create their own industries. The companies creating these products tend to spend heavily on R&amp;D, and the industry is not yet well-defined, so the company looks ""inefficient"" compared with mature companies operating in adjacent industries.  I think if it were say, three years ago, it would take a lot of imagination to see how AI is going to transform the chip industry. The tech wasn't there, and the value proposition wasn't clear. But today, I think it takes willful ignorance to stand there and say that chips are going to plateau and the bubble is about to pop. So I'm going to continue to scoop up SMH and I'll see you all in another 3 months to talk about how it went.","For point 1 the counterpoint is that AI suffers from a sort of last mile problem where it can do a lot of interesting things but doesn't do most of them that well and might not ever be able to do them well. It fundamentally works by processing data to ""learn"" (it doesn't actually know anything so I put learn it quotes), but eventually more data doesn't help and edge cases go unsolved. This is why Tesla has never delivered on its autonomous driving promises that are 10+ years old now and why [Sam Altman is full of shit](https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-is-full-of-shit/) (see this blog for other interesting critiques of AI).","No, but I think there is a lot of hype around a myriad of other uses of AI that may well never pan out. The link I provided goes into how some of this hype manifests. Calling it ""AI"" at all is a bit of a misnomer. No doubt there are some uses today for these chips but I think you'd have to acknowledge the monetization potential is just that . . potential, and has some difficult problems to work out before reaching where a lot of investors assume it will go.  Just pointing to two tools and saying hey look these are useful therefore AI is the future is not a great case imo","In-house chip designs are still being manufactured by fabs like TSMC, Samsung, etc.","thank you for this post! have been contemplating buying extra too, but bit hesitant since the huge spike last month.  one question: what do you think about big companies like Apple and Microsoft trying to make in-house chips? this could seriously threaten an index like SMH in the coming years?","It's not a misnomer. We were calling things way, way dumber than this ""AI"" six decades ago, and nobody had any problem with that. We all knew that it didn't mean ""this thing is as smart as a human"". It just means ""this thing can emulate some humanlike behaviors in some at least vaguely-convincing way"".  Nobody (sane, at least) is saying current AI is as smart as a human, either. But it's clearly a hell of a lot closer than what we had ten years ago, and if it doesn't deserve the label AI then the term is simply useless because it doesn't apply to anything.","You're setting the standard ""as smart as a human,"" this AI isn't as smart as anything. It's an algorithm, one that can spit-out some things that appear to require intelligence but in the case of AI are analyzing and processing data to spit out digestible content. This is not general intelligence and to actually create AI is pretty much a completely different problem than that which has been developed with generative AI. That progress has been made in one doesn't really lend much of anything to the other.","So basically you've redefined the term ""AI"" to mean something different than it has ever meant in the past, pointed out that LLMs do not meet this unique definition that only you are using, and then claimed victory in the argument.

investing,May,1d0sfn6,Quantitative Approach to Dividend Investing - 3 year update,"I made a post little over 3 years ago over in [](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/nsvt3d/using_a_purely_quantitative_approach/) about trying out a quantitative approach to dividend investing. I just wanted to put an update since that post. I have an equities screen that filters out companies based on my criteria, and every month I rotate/rebalance my portfolio based on that list and have gotten pretty promising results.    What kind of results?   Over last 3 years (not including contributions):  || || ||3yr Annualized Returns|3yr Cumulative Returns| |Dividend Portfolio|+11.20%|+37.50%| |S&amp;P500|+8.06%|+26.20%|    So why post in r/investing instead?   1. Given the general favorability forwards growth, I do want to know different opinions on this approach. 2. Want to see how this can be improved or what I may be missing in this strategy?    I do also want to preface, I have 2 other portfolios what I contribute to, 1 that is purely in VOO, and 1 that is all growth, risk tolerant, and Mag 7 stocks. I am also an advocate that each portfolio should have a purpose and goal which I'll explain this one's below...  So what is the strategy?  * Current Market Cap (at time of rotation): &gt;20 Billion * Dividend Yield (at time of rotation): &gt;3.5% * P/E Ratio (at time of rotation): &lt;100 * Dividend Payout Ratio: &lt;55 * 1-Year Total Return (at time of rotation): &gt;= 0  And run this filter at the beginning of every month, kicking out companies that no longer make the cut, and adding new ones that did. As well as backtest this over last 5yr, 10yr, 25yr periods to compare against the S&amp;P500.   For the most part, the portfolio dividend yield come to be \~4%, and vast majority of the dividends I get are qualified dividends, despite the monthly rotation. So taxes on the dividends are kept to a minimum.      So the goal of this? This is my to attempt to out perform the market over the long run, with less risk, and with least effort as possible. The eventuality is withdrawing dividends to supplement my income.    A quick lookup puts VOO 10yr sharpe ratio at 0.74 and average annualized return of 12.33%.    Backtesting puts this strategy has its 10yr sharpe ratio at 0.95, and average annualized return of 18.9%.    Some caveats I do recognize tho, but still think it makes the effort worth it:   Half the time I do not know what companies I am buying. It is all companies that fit the criteria at the time, regardless of how they are actually doing. For example, if I did this the 15 years ago I would have had WaMu before they went bust. More recently, it had a regional bank during the bank failures.   I also am forced to sell stock on top of getting dividends, which so far the performance still makes up for. On the flip side, I also would sell losers if the filter says so, so theres that.   I also miss out on major tech bull runs like in 2023. Also on the flip side, I was still positive in 2022 with the constant rate hikes.      While past performance does not equate to future returns, I do like this strategy and do plan on continuing for at least another 7 years, and may do a 5yr check in, but has been a fruitful 3 years so far.",Yes but you compound tax-free...  That is extraordinary and not to be underestimated.,"I do not usually comment on Reddit posts (mostly because of the whole API thing and I hate logging in).  I noticed in the post you referenced in r/dividends that the PE ratio you stated was &lt;20, but in this post you say it is &lt;100. Did you find that your portfolio was not diversified enough with the prior criterion?",So net of tax is it pretty safe to assume that this underperformed the S&amp;P? What is your average holding period?,As in DRIP to the underlying stock? I don‚Äôt. Dividends will be put to work at the beginning of the following month anyway,"Yeah that was a change since that last post.¬†  I suppose diversification was my original reasoning back then that prompted the change from &lt;20 to &lt;100 to not miss on companies that are suddenly growing.¬†  But it was kept in because of success from multiple backtesting using it. After 5yr, 10yr, 25yr backtesting it turned out being less restrictive on PE was magnitudes better than that original screen, so I kept it. (I also remember backtesting without any PE Filter and it performed worse than the market)",It‚Äôs all pretax-ed,Do you reinvest the dividents?,Are those returns post or pretax?,This is an interesting approach. How do you approach taxes with constant moves??,Sometimes its better to be lucky than smart.  This wont work forever.
investing,May,1cr46n2,how safe is SGOV as opposed to a MM Fund,"I've been looking for places to park cash.  I currently do a money market fund with Schwab, which pays around 5.2%.  T Bills are similar and you get to avoid state income tax,  but the downside is you have to lock your money up,whether its for a month or 6 months, its just a little less flexible.    I noticed SGOV pays about 5.2% AND has no state tax, AND is liquid.  Is there a downside to SGOV vs. a Money market fund?  Is it less safe?   thank you!","t-bills are not really ""locked up"" given you can sell them on the secondary market.  You may be forced to sell them for a very small loss if rates move sharply against you and you need the money now but that is no different than SGOV.  SGOV is just buying t-bills.    It is more flexible and convenient in exchange they take a small fee off the top.  The risk profile is nearly identical and incredibly low.","Yes.  As are all dividends.  Dividends are never free money.  They are just paying you with your own money.  The size of the dividend relative to the price, low volatility, and the regular nature of the payments just makes it more obvious with SGOV.",No because there is an ex-dividend date.  It falls after the ex-div date.  If you sell before the ex-div date you will get the higher price but won't get the dividend.  If you sell after the ex-div date you will get the lower price and the dividend.  It is the same either way.,It's safer. But they're both safe enough that you don't need to worry about that.,"&gt;  Is there a downside to SGOV vs. a Money market fund?   No.  They have slight differences that might make a particular person prefer one to the other, but they are basically the same, assuming you are comparing SGOV to a state tax exempt MMF.  &gt; Is it less safe?  Basically no.  Both have minuscule risk of US government collapse.","I noticed SGOV has a monthly price cycle where it resets on the 1st and pays dividends near the 7th.  Do you know if there is an impact to dividends if I sell near the top of the cycle, before the regular payout?  I'm trying to figure out the best strategy for liquidation.","&gt; Note SGOV isn't guaranteed to be 100% state tax exempt. Last year it was around 93% tax exempt though. You have to compute the taxable vs tax exempt portion yourself. It is pretty simple but if you want a statement from your brokerage showing tax exempt interest then buy t-bills instead.  Oh, I see. I imagine this is also the case for the vanguard federal and treasury money market funds. Where will I need to look to determine the portion of interest that's state-tax exempt?",Ahhh so the dividend distribution is taken directly from the share.,Nothing is more secure than having your own T Bills.  Usually pays better than SGOV or MMFs too.,Sadly there is no universal standard.  There should be a disclosure filed by the fund which goes under a number of different names which breaks down the taxable vs tax exempt portion of the distribution for the year.  For SGOV it looks like this:  [https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/tax-information/2023-ishares-us-government-source-income-information-stamped.pdf](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/tax-information/2023-ishares-us-government-source-income-information-stamped.pdf)  They put one of these out early in the following year (so Jan or Feb 2024 for the 2023 tax year).

Or is 10% top line growth actually a good representation of their growth prospects?  My intuition is that the market takes short term trends or concerns and extrapolates them far into the future (where most of the value is), and therefore these concerns represent a longer term buying opportunity.

If you insist on speculating with individual stocks, then keep that separate from your retirement nest egg and don‚Äôt speculate with any money you aren‚Äôt fully prepared to lose. Consider your trading no different than going to Vegas and putting chips on a table, because it isn‚Äôt that different.   If you don‚Äôt have a library card, get one. Your local library likely has subscriptions to one or more of ValueLine, WSJ, Barron‚Äôs, and Grant‚Äôs Interest Rate Observer. ValueLine is by far the best resource for trying to mimic a modern-day Benjamin Graham.  Look for companies in disfavored industries, not tech or healthcare. Avoid recently IPO‚Äôed startups and distressed companies. If they trade in the pink sheets stay far away. Look for low price/earnings and low price/book value, but a track record of long-term earnings growth, low debt, and decent return on capital. Once you‚Äôve filtered on those quantitative metrics, hopefully you‚Äôve identified a handful of companies that might interest you. If you have a choice between two companies, go with one in a business you find interesting. Like mining? Then don‚Äôt look at Kraft Heinz, look at Freeport McMoran. List your top 20 or 30 candidates.

There are myriad ways to value shares of a public company.

investing,May,1cow4e0,Real Estate vs. The Market - An answer to all those touting real estate as the way out there,"Real estate has often been touted as one of the most accessible ways to grow real wealth. Who among us ambitious haven‚Äôt heard the platitudinous claims passed off as conventional wisdom or perhaps as an arcane right of passage into occult upper echelons of society?  *‚ÄúReal estate makes more millionaires than any other industry.‚Äù*  We have heard it in forums, self-help books, and from passing snake oil peddlers trying to get you to sign up for their educational seminar so you too can get rich.  As an engineer fortunate enough to not be living pay check to pay check as many Americans do, I also found this promise alluring. After all the basic principle that you can own a second home and collect a sizable and secure supplemental income certainly seems like a good deal at first approximation and so when me and my wife moved out of our first home for new jobs, we decided to keep it as a rental property rather than sell it.  We had purchased the property for only $130,000 dollars in 2017 and after living there for about five years the value had doubled. It was also located in an above average area of growth in South Carolina that had seen explosive growth going from Hicksville, USA to having two Starbucks by the time we moved out (of course the number of Starbucks is the proper measure of affluence). We were able to rent the house out with ease for two years for $1,800 a month while all of the recurring costs amounted to only $1,000 a month.  Indeed on paper it was an excellent investment. But when a difficult tenant started to stress us out we began to wonder if having a rental was worth all the hype in comparison to less stressful alternative investments.  So I decided that rather than scouring the internet for advice from likely unqualified faceless charlatans, I would conduct my own analysis of owning a rental home vs. simply investing in the stock market. After all, at one point in the not so distant past relying on your own mind rather than the top 10 Google search results to reach your own conclusions was considered desirable.  # The Calculation  My methodology was to calculate the total net benefit over the next 22 years (the time until the house would be paid off) in today‚Äôs dollars of keeping the rental vs. the total net benefit in today‚Äôs dollars of selling it and investing the proceeds in an index fund for 22 years and compare the two results. Although seemingly simple, the reality is that the financials of rentals are convoluted and comparing them to neat investments is¬†*actually kind of difficult.*¬†There are a lot of assumptions and extrapolations that must be made about both benefits and expenses.  The total net benefit for market investing was actually pretty simple. I estimated that the total proceeds from a sale after everything was said and done would be $100,000. So simply applied compounding interest to calculate the value I‚Äôd have in 22 years.  For this I assumed the historical average market return of 10% (7% accounting for inflation) as well as a few other higher returns to see how I would fare if things went well.  Because I will not be retired in 22 years and this money would be growing in a traditional taxed brokerage account, I made the assumption that if I wanted to derive regular income from the final capital I would have to sell everything and take the fat 15% long-term capital gains tax in order to move the money from an index fund into a high yield fund providing a yield of 5%. I then further assumed that as income I would have to pay 29% of those earnings in federal and state taxes. This yielded the total income I could expect in my pocket every month after investing for 22 years.  Total derived benefit and possible income for investing $100,000 in index funds after 22 years.  The calculation for the house was much more tenuous, but as I mentioned earlier, you do have to make some big assumptions to make a comprehensive assessment of the total net benefit of renting a house for 22 years. I started by calculating the¬†**total positive factors**:  **Total rent ‚Äî**¬†Assuming that I will increase rent at 3% to keep up with inflation, I assumed an average rent value for a total present day value of all collected rents over 22 years of $468,600. I then adjusted this value for an assumed vacancy rate of 8% to yield¬†**$431,112 (A)**.  **Appreciation**¬†‚Äî Of course one of the benefits of real estate is that it generally appreciates at a rate that is commensurate with the desirability of the location. Before things exploded circa 2022 and houses got crazy expensive, the rate of appreciation in my area was just under 5%. This is a good bit better than the historical national average of 3.5%. Since it is a higher growth area in South Carolina where I‚Äôll used the higher number. At 5% appreciation (2% after accounting for inflation) I can expect the house value to grow from the present value of $250,000 to about $386,494 or an increase of¬†**$136,494 (B)**¬†in today‚Äôs dollars.  Although there are¬†*many*¬†other potential benefits of renting a house, at the basic level, the benefits are from rent and appreciation. So the total gross benefit can be calculated simply by adding¬†**A+B**¬†for a total of¬†**$567,606.**  However, the story doesn‚Äôt stop there. There are also negatives or¬†*expenses*¬†associated with owning a rental property. The¬†**total negative factors**¬†were calculated as:  **Capital gains tax on sale-**¬†It turns out that when you sell your house after many years of appreciation you have to pay long-term capital gains tax on the profit.¬†*There actually are ways around this*¬†but as we will discuss later they probably are pretty useless to the average one-off real estate investor. So since I paid $130,000 for the house and expect it to be worth $386,494 when I ultimately sell it 22 years from now, the net profit is $256,494 which is taxed at 15% costing¬†**$38,474 (A)**.  **Depreciation recapture tax-**¬†When you rent out a house you get to depreciate it‚Äôs value every year like any other large capital assett in a business. This means you can kind of say you ‚Äúlost‚Äù a certain amount of value every year from use. That depreciation ultimately helps lower your taxes every year and so it is a benefit‚Ä¶.kind of.  When the time comes to sell your house, you actually have to pay the government back for all the asset depreciation you claimed. You could try to figure this out yourself, but I just used an online calculator and figured that I would have to pay about¬†**$31,200 (B)**¬†in depreciation recapture tax.  **Sales cost ‚Äî**¬†There are also significant costs associated with actually selling your house. Things like real estate agent commissions and repairs can really add up. Based on some internet research I saw that 8% is a reasonable number for sales cost. It could be more if there are many repairs needed. At 8% it would cost¬†**$30,920 (C)**¬†to sell a house for $386,494.  The total¬†**future expenses at time of sale**¬†can be calculated as¬†**A+B+C**¬†or $100,594. However, this is in 2046 dollars (22 years from 2024). This has to be adjusted to be in present 2024 dollars for the purpose of comparison. The adjusted number in 2024 dollars works out to¬†**$58,432 (D)**.  **Maintenance ‚Äî**¬†There are also repairs to consider. Any repairs that are not covered by the rent payments come out of your pocket. There are a lot of assumptions that you have to make here. I was actually pretty light on repairs assuming that the tenant wouldn‚Äôt trash the place and that only predictable things would need to get done. This included things like replacing the roof once, changing the carpet out three times in 22 years, and painting the place several times, and replacing the wooden privacy fence once. I also made the assumption that most of the repairs would be sooner rather than later. I browsed the internet to get estimated repair costs and life expectancy numbers. For 22 years I estimated¬†**$75,000 (E)**¬†(in today‚Äôs dollars). Honestly, I think this number is very light and could easily see it being twice that.  So everything said and done, the total gross expense in present money can be found by adding¬†**D**¬†and¬†**E**¬†for a¬†**total of $133,432.**  The¬†**total net benefit**¬†can¬†*finally*¬†be calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total benefits, or¬†**$434,174**¬†($567,606 ‚Äî $133,432 )**.**  When we compare this with the estimated stock market returns, we see that it is on par with the 11% return (8% after inflation) which is slightly better than the more conservative 7% often quoted. So at that it looks like real estate wins! ‚Ä¶ however there is still more to consider.  # Other Considerations  Remember why I started looking at this in the first place? I said that having a rental property was beginning to stress me out. Even with a property management company ‚Äúrunning things‚Äù the reality is that it is impossible for them to take care of your property the way you would want to. They aren‚Äôt there day in and day out noticing the slow degradation of condition. Yes, they will catch the big things and hopefully boot tenants that are trashing the place, but the insidious decay will be left un-noticed until it becomes a big enough problem.  For me, being emotionally attached to the house, I find this to be¬†*incredibly stressful.*¬†It is fair to say that not everyone feels that way about their properties, some are able to treat them strictly as business assets that require repair when they stop working. However, you really can‚Äôt discount the psychological affects of dealing with someone who doesn‚Äôt care about your home the way you do.  So now we are talking about 22 years of stress. That is 22 years of worrying if you are going to go in to sell the place and find that the house should be condemned and repairs would take a tremendous chunk out of what you expected (possible A LOT more than that $75k we estimated). That is 22 years of stress dealing with tenants and having to watch their ridiculous and rude maintenance tickets come through your email where they call you a ‚Äúslum lord‚Äù and tell you that the carpet looks like someone ‚Äútook a shit on it‚Äù (mind you¬†*this*¬†is who is living in the house you once loved).  *Is it still worth the difference?*  That is a personal determination that everyone in this situation must make on their own. In my case, I am leaning towards ‚Äòno.‚Äô  *But why does everyone make a bid deal out of real estate? If the actual returns are comparable to the market, why is it so special?*  Now¬†*that*¬†is the question, and I think that we are ready to answer it given the context of the above analysis.  If the total net benefit really is comparable to the market then why in the hell would anyone want to dabble in real estate let alone claim it is¬†*‚Äúthe way?‚Äù*  I am hardly the Supreme Overlord Barron Lord Admiral of real estate investing, but I know enough to tell you that the reasons have to do with those secondary benefits we deferred from earlier.  The primary benefit of real estate is¬†*leverage.*¬†Leverage is the idea that you can own a house using primarily someone else‚Äôs money (i.e., the bank‚Äôs through a mortgage). This means you get the full benefit of owning a house and renting it (full appreciation, equity, and rent proceeds) with minimal investment of your own. You are taking out a loan to buy an asset and having someone else pay for it. Leverage is possible for stock investing, but houses are much more secure investments and banks realize this and so the rates and terms are much more reasonable than taking out a loan to buy stocks. So why would you ever want to give that up?  The reality is that you are only leveraged while you are ‚Ä¶. well, leveraged. As your equity in the house increases (either by paying down the mortgage or through appreciation) you become less leveraged. That is to say that magical benefit of real estate decreases with the less you owe.  Look at it this way. Say you only owe the bank one more dollar on your mortgage; while you still don‚Äôt own the house outright, you have nearly 100% equity. That equity is effectively¬†*your money*¬†(not the bank‚Äôs) that can be applied to anything and thus it carries an opportunity cost. That is, you have to compare what it is doing for you tied up in the house to what you could get from the market or other investments. If the situation were flipped and you only had one dollar of equity, it is a¬†**much**¬†better deal‚Ä¶ you couldn‚Äôt do much else with that single dollar.¬†*The more equity you have in your house, the less leveraged it is, and the more it acts like a traditional stock.*  What you‚Äôll find, is that houses perform very much like high dividend, low growth stocks. That is, they provide good income, but appreciate less than the market. When we do the comparison (as we did above) it really does come out as more of a wash than many burgeoning real estate investors might think.  There are other benefits to owning a home. For example, it is real and has an intrinsic value; when the next great depression happens, people will still need a place to live. Plus, since mortgages don‚Äôt change with time (that is they get cheaper with time due to inflation)¬†*you*¬†could live there during difficult times, probably for much less than your current rent or mortgage.  Although these are secondary considerations, there are also creative financial mechanisms available for homes. For example, home equity loans or lines of credit can give you a better rate when you need money compared to a private loan. There are also mechanisms to avoid having to pay taxes on your gains (possibly until you die) such as 1031 exchanges, however these are very complicated and are really only designed for real estate investors to turn one property into another. They are nearly useless for the average Joe with maybe one rental (big surprise).  We also hear a lot about the tax benefits of owning rental property. What are those? Well you can claim depreciation. Depreciation is the government‚Äôs way of acknowledging that large capital business assets (think a large factory machine) lose value over time as they are used. So you are generally allowed to claim back the full purchase price of your home over the course of 30 years which helps to offset taxes on the rental income. However, you¬†*do have to pay it all back*¬†when you sell the house in a process called depreciation recapture tax. So maybe it isn‚Äôt that much of a benefit after all‚Ä¶.the real benefit is that since you pay it back later it is worth less due to inflation. Not a huge benefit‚Ä¶ You can also claim business operating expenses to also help offset your rental income (think new roof, new windows, repairs, project management fees etc.).  So now seeing the whole picture it is obvious that there are¬†*some*¬†benefits to owning a rental home over investing in the stock market. However, they may not be what you thought. Let‚Äôs recap:  * **The total net benefit from renting a house, vs. investing in the market is likely comparable.** * **Renting a house is much more stressful (even with a management company) than investing in the stock market. You have to have the right kind of personality to not be affected by people trashing your place, being rude to you, and, if this was a home you lived in, the steady decay of a home you once loved (because no, management companies do not maintain houses like you did when you lived there). There is also (i‚Äôd argue) a lot more variability in how you‚Äôll fare with real estate (assumptions about vacancy rate, long-term repairs, etc.)** * **The primary benefit of owning rentals is the ability to leverage into a stable investment on favorable terms. The more of your house you own, the more they perform like traditional stocks and the less argument there is for keeping it due to the opportunity cost of your tied up equity.** * **There are some secondary benefits, pertaining to taxes, the actual utility of the home, and some creative financing opportunities.**  **So in conclusion:**¬†what does this mean? It means in an apple to apple comparison houses are good investments that rival stock markets but they are much more stressful. However, with leverage being the primary benefit¬†*there is*¬†a real advantage here if you are willing to maximize your leverage in the real estate market.  If you are going to have one house and pay it off and keep it for income, I‚Äôd advise you to consider other options if it is stressing you out as (1) it won‚Äôt make you rich and (2) it may not be better than the markets.¬†**However,**¬†if you are going to go big and leverage leverage (no not a typo) there is a possibility to do well.  So what does that mean? Money is made in real estate at the front end by making good investments and using (and I mean USING leverage). If you are willing to maximize your credit and home equity usage as much as possible to buy more and more houses putting as little of your own money into each one as possible and you are willing to have a part or full-time job dealing with managing them all and it won‚Äôt stress you out, it is¬†**a**¬†path to wealth. Of course, you could also do well just dropping that $100k into the S&amp;P 500 and call it a day.","I think you're underselling the ""secondary"" benefits of tax advantages.  There's a ton of ways to make your real estate business lose money on paper and turn a tidy profit in reality (I have a rental unit in an S-corp that makes roughly 15k per year profit but only about 5k applied to AGI).  It does take active management of the finances, which is obviously a drag on your time if not your money.  There's also the advantages of buying as a primary home and then converting to rental, which in this era of high interest rates may be particularly attractive to those with sub-3% extant mortgages.  But in terms of set it and forget it? Passive investing can't be beat.","""touted"" is right.  i was looking around at properties in my area, thought i might buy my first house. i then went and calculated the YoY percentage rise in price, and even though things looked like they were rising fast, when you ran the numbers they averaged out to like 3% per year.  so i just plunked everything i had into index funds and t-bills and figured id wait til interest rates fall again.",Yes!

At these rates, if you were to borrow $500k, you would pay $796k of interest. Assuming 20% down, you‚Äôre buying a property worth $625k. Let‚Äôs say you can rent it out for $3500/mth. Rent does not go up lockstep with inflation because tenants can‚Äôt afford it.   Skipping the nuances of calculation, you‚Äôre up 4.26% per year, before taxes, insurance and maintenance. Not great Bob.","You need to consider the difference between precision and accuracy.  Change any one of your input assumptions and watch the outputs change.

investing,May,1cjdqiw,Managed at 1% Fee vs Self Directed ,"I got a call this week to listen to a pitch to do a Managed Account. I haven't received anything official yet in terms of quotes, but I believe he said that it would be 1% per year. They gave me a grade of ""decent to respectable"" on my self directed investing approach, but per the reports they were showing me, they said I am leaving money on the table and that the 1% managed fee would more than make up for itself.  1% a year, if you wrote a check, is a lot of money. Say you have 1M in retirement, 1% is $10,000. Roughly a thousand bucks a month. I am having a hard time swallowing it when looking at it this way.  I imagine millions of people are paying at least this. But I am interested in hearing thoughts, comments and opinions on this.",1% aum over 30 years is likely to add up to about a quarter of your portfolio.  Consider the bogleheads approach. It has served me very well over a long time.  [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE\_investment\_philosophy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy),unless they shit gold bars or are doing insider trading their 1% fee will not pay for itself on average,"Not just better, 300bp net better over the term of the average relationship.  Thats material.  I will say, almost all of the value in an advisor is in their ability to stop clients from trading their account.  If you have the discipline to leave your account the fuck alone, you don‚Äôt need an advisor.  If you can‚Äôt stop yourself from tinkering, you should have one.","Did you request this interaction or did they cold call you?  From my point of view, I'm never inclined to participate in things that involve cold calling.  They're calling you because they want to sell you something.  They want your money.  If you can do it yourself and don't have to pay someone, do it yourself.",More people need to understand this! There‚Äôs a reason why those salesmen don‚Äôt charge a flat $1000 a year to take and invest your funds. It‚Äôs because most people (unlike OP who is rightfully asking questions) gloss over the 1% figure. Compounded over 30-40 years that 1% a year means you‚Äôre giving away a significant portion of your nestegg. 1/4 is very conservative.,"Unless you have an account worth more than $1m, there is no chance they ‚Äúcame prepared‚Äù they pulled up a report while the auto-dialed was calling your number and you both read through it for the first time together.

I've heard countless stories of people saying they lost half their savings in 2008 and never got it back. They never got it back cuz they sold and never got back in.,"I tried for 4 years to be a financial advisor. I sucked at it. Why? Because all the training I received was sales training (first big hint) and all the things you have to do to stay employed revolves around making more money for the firm - bringing in more clients (leaving less time for your existing clients) and getting that sweet sweet recurring monthly fee. They tell you your number one priority is the client, because they have to, and then promptly only grade you on your literal financial value to the company. My largest client only wanted to buy brokered CDs - he was extremely conservative and that was what he wanted to do. He did not count as a ""household"" for me or towards my performance goals.   Here's the way I look at this situation: If they are charging you a fee and explaining it in terms of making up for it in performance, you should ignore them. IF they persist (and they're all used car salesmen, so why wouldn't they?) then I would ask them to see their performance charted out against a portfolio that lines up with your desired risk tolerance (S&amp;P 500 isn't right for everyone because not everyone has that risk profile). If they give you the ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"" speech, then I'd walk away. (That phrase is true, obviously, but I'd still like to know how they did)  If they are charging you a fee and they talk about comprehensive planning, building you a custom portfolio to match your goals, and to do an overall financial plan into retirement, taking into account inheritances, taxes, your own heirs, trust needs, and explaining how to do things in the most tax efficient way possible - I'd listen. But only if you have significant assets and want that sort of thing. And even then, it may not make sense. I genuinely feel that only in cases of extreme wealth (&gt;$10mm) is it even necessary to have a financial advisor.   TL;DR - probably not worth it since he's couching it in terms of performance paying for the fee - unless you have beaucoup bucks.   Just my 2 cents. Not advice, etc. etc. etc.",They are just trying to sell you a service you don't need

Best thing they can do is keep everything where it is, and roll it over once they get employed again with the new employer's 401k (if they have one).   Sometime the best ""strategy"" is not doing anything.","If bankrupt they will most likely terminate the 401k plan which is a distributable event and they can rollover the money.

Morgan resells a variety of funds in the area from Hamilton Lane, StepStone, Blue Owl credit and a couple others.  This whole area is new to me and I‚Äôm doing lots of independent research from what MS pitched me. Everything seems to make sense on why this is a good diversification method and how potentially their returns will be strong. I have concerns since it still seems like a black box/trust me investment that also carries higher fees. I‚Äôve done well doing what I‚Äôm doing and I understand real companies, ETFs etc  this is harder to be comfortable with.

Also are the rates historically this high or before the high interest rates could you get margin rates below 10%?",they aren't,"Theoretically, when the risk free rate rises the price of equities falls proportionately so that the equity risk premium remains in excess of the risk free rate.

However, most brokers charge margin rates far above the risk free rate.","you can get lower rate loans if you negotiate (or move funds to IBKR), sub 7%  its still not good for long term investing at that rate though",IBKR is \~1% above the fed-funds rate and even lower if you have more capital.

Vanguards TDF goes to 30% stocks 70% bonds,"Its not a maturity date its simply a date to indicate when the strategy will reach its final ""retirement"" allocation. You can sell shares whenever you want just like any other ETF or MF.  About 5 years after the date on the TDF it will be merged with a ""Target Date Income"" fund or similar product. These have very high bond allocations and in theory you could simply withdraw the monthly distributions instead of selling shares.  In retirement, you don't simply cash everything out, you stay invested and sell shares periodically and/or withdraw dividend and capital gains distributions instead of reinvesting them. Your investment allocation will be more conservative but its still invested.","You withdraw as needed.  Retirement can be 20 or even 30+ years, having some stock even after retirement helps keep some amount of growth.","So you‚Äôll just keep the TDF in the portfolio past the target date and collect on the bond interest until you need to fully liquidate the funds ?

investing,May,1d3xsm8,Analyst rating? Who is that and how are the decisions made?,[https://imgur.com/a/xeXhUC](https://imgur.com/a/xeXhUCu)  I wonder what does analysts do to forecast the target price and how to know if they are trustworthy. Anyone take analyst‚Äôs forecast very seriously and actually invest based on that? Looks like analysts and morningstar research come up with different conclusions¬†on Nvidia.,"I worked at a high level in equity research for a top tier investment bank. To forecast target prices we build financial models and would use DCF and other methods. A target price is basically a valuation.   We had access to data from analysts covering similar stocks and very good access company management. I could often just call the CFO of big firms.   My clients were giant global institutional investors or fund managers. Frequently they would have much more experience than we did and might even know the companies better. I had clients who had done my job and covered the same companies ten years ago and has been investing large amounts in them since that time.   However, it is important to realize that both research and my own experience shows that the price target is actually among the least valued part of reports for institutional investors. The most valued in my opinion is the ability to spend a lot of time to understand dynamics in the industry and the company‚Äôs position within that as well as access to management that allowed me to ask questions directly and privately.  It is natural and health for different analysts or brokers to have different opinions. The share price of a listed company is very close to being an example of an efficient market entity. Basically half the market thinks it is undervalued and half think it is overvalued.   Good institutional investors often want to see both arguments- for and against and can use that to make the best decision.   I always believed that my role as a analyst was to help clients make the best investment decisions, not to make those decisions myself. I have sort of said to analysts who worked for me that if all of our competitors have a ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù on a stock and they want to get attention maybe they need to consider a ‚ÄúSell‚Äù. The market needs both.  A good investor will be happy to see a buy and a sell rating on a stick they are interested in. They presumably already have a view on the company and industry.

To the extent that you are not eligible to make an IRA or 529 plan contribution or have already made your maximum IRA or 529 plan contribution for the year, any additional contributions can subject you to IRS excise taxes. It is your responsibility to ensure that any deposits to your Fidelity account are eligible contributions and do not violate the terms of your Fidelity accounts, applicable IRS contribution rules, or limitations or other applicable laws or regulations. Consult your tax advisor concerning tax consequences.  Prior to accepting the transfer of Points from Elan Financial Services, Fidelity will verify whether you have reached your maximum contribution amount with Fidelity for that year. If we determine that you have fully contributed to your Fidelity IRA accounts for that year or reached the maximum contribution limit on your Fidelity-managed 529 plan account, Fidelity will not accept the Points transfer, and your Points will continue to accrue at Elan Financial Services. Customers can continue to let Points accrue until the next year, or they can redeem these Points for other rewards, such as travel, merchandise, gift cards, or statement credit.  Under IRS rules, individuals who do not have earned income are generally not eligible to make IRA contributions. Spousal IRAs are not eligible.  IRS rules also prohibit IRA contributions from being made to Traditional and Rollover IRAs for the year an IRA owner reaches age 70¬Ω and beyond.  If you are also making contributions to another company's IRA, Fidelity is unable to monitor whether you have maximized your total annual IRA contributions, and we will not be able to stop the reward contribution from going to your Fidelity IRA.""","In case you did not know, you will only able to transfer the cashback to fidelty account once you have atleast $25.

You have one bucket that could come from owning real estate that you rent out to tourist, you have another that comes from the income from your job, and maybe another that comes from the dividends from the investment of the money you‚Äôve saved so far, and maybe another from the side hustle you have selling on Amazon in the United States goods that you find as you travel around the country‚Ä¶ Each of these become a source of revenue that compounds over the course of a very long time.

investing,May,1chnfn3,How does SGOV pay out the dividend?,"I threw a substantial amount of money into SGOV maybe two weeks ago. I was expecting an approximate payout of 5.38% of that amount, divided by 12. Instead, I received about $50 into my CASH position (something that I set up to do).   Is this because I wasn't invested for the whole month? Or, was I supposed to sell all shares yesterday, and repurchase them today when the dip occured?",SGOV hasn‚Äôt paid its monthly interest yet.  Its pay date is May 7th.  That $50 you got must have been from the time you had funds in your sweep position (money market most likely).,Of course you‚Äôre not going to get a month‚Äôs worth of return for 2 weeks of investment.   SGOV isn‚Äôt a savings account so you need to understand how bond ETFs work.   Very ELI5. Every month the underlying bond yield is added to the ETF price daily. Lately that‚Äôs ~$0.45 per share. At the end of the month the fund pays the interest it earned on bonds as a dividend. Dividends decrease the share price by their amount.   So theoretically you‚Äôre earning around $0.45 per $100.30 (the base share price of SGOV which will also change based on the underlying bonds value) so ~0.45% per month per share owned that‚Äôs 5.4% per year.   If you buy mid-month the first 2 weeks of interest have already been added to the share price so you‚Äôre not getting that yield.,There‚Äôs no reason to do this. The price changes through the month and drops on the ex-dividend date by the amount of the dividend.,No.,"The only people that do this are citizens of countries where they have no capital gains taxes, but dividends are taxed as ordinary income.","it really doesn't matter much when you buy/sell SGOV, and there's no real way to time it. the stock gradually rises every month in anticipation of the dividend, and drops by a corresponding amount after it's paid out. just look at a 1-year+ timeseries of the stock.",Capital gain in this case only matters if you have capital loss to offset. Short-term capital gain like this is taxed at normal tax rate,Thank you!,"Agreed. It's a rare scenario to be in, though I found myself there in my bumpy trading journey. High taxable income companied with more capital loss than I'll be able to carry over for my expected life thanks to a former advisor who was a Cathy Woods fanboy. It's better to ensure I burn though all of that carryover in addition to normal losses incurred in annual trading.    Kind of silly, I know. It's not a serious strategy for the average person who can use it as a HYSA or otherwise a simple place to park cash not in use, but still highly liquid. With even modest enough quantities traded (25-50k+), it starts to make a small difference in taxes. Since we're all here for an edge, near risk free tax optimization is part of the game.",SGOV hasn't paid out since April 17th so your time scale doesn't make sense to me.  But normally it will pay around 45c/share.  So if you buy it two weeks before the ex-dividend date (I think that was yesterday) then your position will show a loss for approximately two weeks - but of course you'll have the 45c/share dividend.

IV = intravenous and ER is obviously Emergency Room.,"Not a nurse, but was similarly confused.","Since Implied Volatility is forward looking and is based around a mathematical formula. At any one point in time you are looking to make a purchase during market open, the price is already baked in. Which is why people often worry about Implied Volatility crush. In other words the pattern is based simply on expectation and time horizon, there is not necessarily an identifiable pattern other then the fact that it is highest pre earnings (unknown future) and lowest post earnings (known).

investing,May,1cm0imy,A question about dividends,I(20m) can't say why just yet but I believe I'm going to obtain a rather large sum of money. I was wondering how much invested money can get me about 2-2.5k a month. I do still plan on working but I'd like to know how much on average is invested to generate that amount of side income to help me live a slightly more comfortable life until I retire. I don't intend on blowing the money in one go and wanna make it last to a point where I can maybe start some minor generational wealth if I do decide on having kids.,"If you want the portfolio to produce $24k to $30 per year AND grow to provide generational wealth, then my answer is at least $1M.  2500 x 12 / 0.03","First, I suggest not chasing yields with dividends. Extremely high yield stocks tend to not grow much. Therefore, it‚Äôs not really a good long term play because your total return will gradually be eaten away by inflation.   That said, I‚Äôd mix a couple ETFs like an S&amp;P ETF and a high yield dividend ETF. If you find the right balance and allocation, you might average around 2% yield or a little more. These funds will also give you the benefit of sustainable growth over time.   $2,500 per month (although, dividends are paid quarterly, not monthly) comes out to $30,000 per year.   $30,000 / 0.02 = $1,500,000  You would need a principal of $1,500,000 to earn $30,000 in dividends per year based on a 2% yield.",Monthly dividends didn't really give you much beyond quarterly.,No they don't. Technically they compound slower. The fastest compounding is a stock that doesn't pay dividends at all. Your entire investment is continuously compounding.,You could get 2.5k per month from 600k.  But to get 2.5k per month from a well diversified portfolio would take well over 1mil,"If you want income between now and retirement AND you want to preserve most of the money for use during retirement then taking dividends while slowing the rest of your investment to grow will indeed work, so long as you‚Äôre comfortable with your overall investment growth being slower than expected.   With a well diversified mix of funds you‚Äôll have an average dividend yield of 2-2.5%. Let‚Äôs use 2% to be safe.  To generate the income you desire you‚Äôll need $1.2m and you could use a mix of funds like:  SPLG - SP500 DGRO - Dividend growth IEFA- International developed markets  Folks are going to show up in the comments section and tell you that dividends are irrelevant, which is technically correct, but for you they can serve as a wise way of separating the money you can spend now vs money you refuse to touch. Very often managing behaviors is more important than improving the investment plan a tiny bit.","Well depends what we mean by diversify. Like do we mean diversify between low yield assets like bonds, CDs, HYSA, money market?   Bc these historically yield lower than stocks (securities)  The s&amp;p for instance has an inflation adjusted return annually of around 7-8% historically, that‚Äôs an average so in given years more or less but in balance 7-8%  Right now long term government bonds yield about 5.4% and a HYSA gonna get you 4-5%  These have the advantage of being pretty safe for your capital, you buy a 30 year bond at 100k and in 30 years you get your 100k back plus you made 5.4% a year minus taxes   Securities are more risky for your capital but historically they‚Äôve been pretty safe as we see with the s&amp;p return. That return is either dividends reinvested keep in mind.  Why people diversify in securities (stocks) is for safety. If I own all my portfolio in McDonald‚Äôs stock and tomorrow they find rat shit in the burgers I‚Äôm gonna lose a lot of money. Less so if only 5% of my portfolio is in MCD.

Assuming normal market conditions, buying and selling shares in good companies can have much higher benefit that seeking out high dividend yields. I suggest you read up on Peter Lynch he talks about this in his second book and breaks it down in great detail.","If you invest 300,000 into JEPQ last month, your dividend this month would‚Äôve paid you $2,440.02  This number can fluctuate monthly depending on their monthly results on options ELN etc etc.   Also, the stock price is stagnate, so only ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù is the income in your pocket.     53$ a share total. $0.4311 per share this month paid.",üëç Putting 10% on a 2% + inflation tips is not the worst idea for anyone over 35

investing,May,1cv48se,"What should I do with $20,000 in savings?","I have about $20,000 in savings and I'm not sure what I should do with it. I'm in my mid 20s with a pretty low paying job (40-50k per year). I currently don't have any investments. I have some student loans but they aren't crazy. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should be doing with this money besides just letting it sit in my savings account?","Some thoughts in order of importance:   * Emergency fund: Stick 3-6 months of income into a high yield savings account (many around 4-5% APY right now) or Money Market (similar yields). This is money you just want to have in case of an emergency and the yield is just to get a little growth and best inflation. Short duration bonds or CDs might be worth mixing in as well.    * Retirement: Open an IRA (Roth or Traditional, Roth is better imo) and contribute up to $7k for the year. Stick to index funds (like VOO) which track the S&amp;P 500, or other broader markets. Don't overthink, just put in a little money here each month.   * Heath/retirement: Open a Health Savings Account (HSA) if you have high deductible health insurance and contribute up to the $4k max contribution for 2024. I suggest a mix of index funds and bond/treasuries funds to have growth and some money just in case of medical needs. Contributions and growth are not taxed if used for medical stuff. Keep the receipts.   * Big life purchases: Set up an account just like your emergency fund to save up for a house, wedding, kids, motorcycle, etc. Put in a little each month.   * If your job has a 401k, you can add more to it up to the 2024 max of $23k. With your income, you probably won't hit this, so maybe add any leftover cash you want.   * Taxable investments: If you have any leftover money and want to play the stock market, open an account here and buy some stocks you like: Apple, Microsoft, Visa, etc.   I recommend you at minimum do the emergency fund and IRA and begin filling both each month. Split that $20k proportionally among the above accounts you want to begin filling.",What rate are your loans?¬†   How much interest are you earning on your savings account?,"Think about opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard.

Emergency fund is important to have though, what I've read is that it's good to target 6 months worth of expenses and keep that in a savings account in case you lose your job or something else happens.   Once the emergency fund is established, ETFs (exchange traded funds) are the next safest thing if you want to see more growth. These are managed by companies and something like VOO includes a portfolio of stocks in the S&amp;P500. It's boring but the best way to ensure you see growth in the long term.

investing,May,1cqc8f9,Investing in Small Cap Value vs Tech (QQQ),"When reviewing the research presented by the likes of Fama - French, Ben Felix and Paul Merriman regarding small cap value they do lots of different comparisons between the different asset classes of stocks. They'll compare Large Cap value, Large Cap Blend (S&amp;P 500), Large Cap Growth, Small Cap Value, Small Cap Growth, REITS and etc. They come to the conclusion that Small Cap Value has performed the best in many different time periods and lengths of time.      In recent times it seems as though Tech namely QQQ (Nasdaq 100) has been outperforming Small Cap Value. All of the aforementioned researchers have compared Small Cap Value to different sectors/ asset classes of stocks but none have really compared them to Tech as an asset class/sector. If we use the readily available data and compare QQQ (tech) to Small Cap Value, QQQ severely outperforms Small Cap Value by a wide margin. Is there any research that shows how Tech has performed going back further than what is available from the data set of QQQ?      Basically, my question is how do we know if Tech wont outperform Small Cap Value when it seems like there hasn't been much research comparing the two like Small Cap Value was compared against other asset classes. And I know the knee jerk answer is to say ‚ÄúYou don't know who will outperform!‚Äù but does anyone know of any research that looked into this, tech vs small cap value?","Tech is not a factor, it‚Äôs a sector. The argument is very complex, but investing in a sector gives you more risk than getting more diversification, but with no higher expected returns. This kind of risk (called idiosyncratic risk) is uncompensated.  The small and value are factors that supposedly serve as proxies for systematic (compensated) risks that do get you better expected returns.  So it‚Äôd be comparing apples to oranges. Technically there could be small cap value stocks.  On the other hand, investing in tech is not only a bad idea due to its high uncompensated risk, but also because how technological revolutions have played out in the past.  When people expect a technological revolution, that drives the prices of the stocks up, which make them seem as great investments when actually high prices mean lower expected returns going forward. That also drives the competition in the sector up, which slows the growth of the companies that were already in existence.  In other words, prices go really high and usually they crash or at least they stop growing.

Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple‚Äôs, which stood at $3.005 trillion.  Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company¬†[reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html)¬†in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.  Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia‚Äôs huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company‚Äôs overall revenue.  Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple‚Äôs sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.  Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again¬†[passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/)¬†earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.  Nvidia‚Äôs stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.  Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years.

investing,Jun,1dr1l96,America‚Äôs Frozen Housing Market Is Warping the Economy,"Cheap mortgages are forcing millions of U.S. homeowners to stay put. That is becoming a problem well beyond the property market.  https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/americas-frozen-housing-market-is-warping-the-economy-35e4f0e5  If you locked in a dirt-cheap mortgage when interest rates were low, congratulations for being one of the winners in America‚Äôs skewed housing market. Renters, realtors and recruiters are among those getting the raw end of the deal.  High interest rates have had an unexpected impact on U.S. housing. Instead of triggering a fall in home prices, as happened with commercial real estate, costlier mortgages have pushed residential values higher. The value of the median existing home rose to a record $419,300 in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. Before the pandemic, it was $270,000.   Blame the ‚Äúlock-in‚Äù effect of ultracheap mortgages secured when interest rates were low, which are trapping owners in their homes. It is an unforeseen consequence of years of easy money. Two-thirds of outstanding U.S. mortgages have a rate below 4%, according to Morgan Stanley‚Äôs housing strategist Jim Egan. Were these homeowners to move, they would have to pay close to 7% for a new 30-year mortgage. The gap hasn‚Äôt been as wide since at least the late 1980s.  Compounding the lock-in effect, most people have fixed-rate mortgages today. More than 90% of newly issued home loans in recent years were 30-year fixed-rate loans, compared with two-thirds in the run-up to the 2008 housing crash.  As more owners stay put, the number of homes on the market has fallen. Tight supply is pushing prices higher, shrinking the pool of buyers who can afford a home. A household earning $100,000 a year can only afford 37% of home listings today, according to the NAR. In a balanced market where there is around five months‚Äô supply of inventory available the number should be 62%.  The frozen housing market has economic consequences. Spending linked to home sales has dropped. People normally splurge to fix up houses before putting them on the market or to renovate them after they move in. Work has dried up for professionals handling the logistics of transactions, such as attorneys and real-estate brokers. Together with the construction of new homes, these activities normally account for 3% to 5% of U.S. output, the National Association of Home Builders estimates.   The flip side is that millions of households that are locked into cheap mortgage rates can afford to spend elsewhere. They are feeling flush thanks to the $119,000 of additional equity the average U.S. mortgage holder has accumulated over the past four years. This may be one reason why consumer spending has been so resilient in the face of higher interest rates, making it harder for the Fed to bring inflation back to its 2% target.    A less obvious loser is the U.S. labor market. Workers are reluctant to accept job offers in another state if it means sacrificing low housing costs, so labor mobility has taken a hit. One study by economists at the University of California Irvine and UC Berkeley estimates that the lock-in effect discouraged 660,000 moves to a new zip code over the year through June 2023.  Craig Picken, co-founder of Northstar Group, a search and recruiting firm of top talent in the aerospace sector, said that it had become difficult to match companies with the right executives because relocations have financial costs that neither employees nor employers want to shoulder. He gave the example of a vice president of engineering trapped in a ‚Äútoxic and bureaucratic‚Äù workplace with a long commute who nonetheless turned down a new role because he had an existing 3% mortgage.  ‚ÄúHis decision came down to an Excel spreadsheet‚Ä¶The salary increase he‚Äôd get with the new job was eaten by higher mortgage costs,‚Äù says Picken.  Another impact of the lock-in effect is that America‚Äôs new homes are shrinking. Houses constructed in 2023 were 5% smaller than those built two years earlier. Builders are trying to keep new homes as affordable as possible for first-time buyers, but the trade-off is less space.  Some housebuilders are winners from the supply crunch, specifically large builders like D.R. Horton that have lending arms. They can use excess profit from high home prices to subsidize buyers‚Äô borrowing costs through mortgage buydowns. They are also less reliant on bank loans to finance construction than smaller rivals. This is one reason why the market share of publicly traded home builders jumped to 51% last year, up from 41% in 2021, according to data provider Zonda.  In theory, if people can‚Äôt afford to buy their own homes, landlords should be able to charge more. Rents for individual family homes rose 3% in April compared with a year earlier, according to CoreLogic data. But rents on apartments are barely rising because there is a glut of new supply, offering some relief for tenants for now.  How long could complications caused by the lock-in effect last? Thomas Ryan, economist at Capital Economics, thinks mortgage rates would need to fall closer to 5% for supply to start to normalize. Most projections are for the 30-year rate to be around 6% by the end of 2025. Even at this level, two-thirds of existing homeowners would still have a mortgage in place that was at least 2 percentage points cheaper.  Some homeowners may decide that they can‚Äôt delay big life decisions. Divorces and growing families will always force some people to sell up. But this will only boost supply on the margin. The strangest housing market in decades won‚Äôt improve soon.  ---  I would just add that housing is easily one of the largest sectors in the economy, and that for most people, their house is by far their most valuable asset.  Back in the 90s and 00s, equity loans from homeowners propelled the stock market to new highs, and may also be partially responsible for the stock market's recent performance post-covid.",Did I just actually read something that says realtors are VICTIMS?  Are you kidding me?,"Have you seen the houses they‚Äôre building now? Cheap AF garbage and charging out the ass, pisses me off how they are ripping off younger people and they have no choice","Yes, people cry about giving architects 2% commissions, who get licensed to practice after 5 years of school and 6 exams tougher than a CPA.

Average rate of return 11.4% per year. I‚Äôm 57, and I hit my retirement number about 6 months ago.   Long version: Been doing this since 1995, mostly the Vanguard s and p 500 index fund. Also the Fidelity Nasdaq fund and a couple of other miscellaneous Vanguard index funds. Some IRA, some Roth, some taxable. I did dollar cost averaging mainly. Picked numbers that would balance out maxing out IRAs with what I could afford, divided by 12 and put that in each month. Also I was self employed for a while and put as much as I could in a SEP IRA, although with that the contribution limits are so high I could never afford to max it out. I followed a few simple rules religiously. Put the money in each month no matter what, reinvest all dividends and never sell. Never sell was key for me. I didn‚Äôt sell when the dot com bubble popped, not when the financial system melted down in 2008, not when COVID hit. Whenever it seemed like the world was ending and markets were cratering, I tried to scrape up a few more dollars to buy more if I could,  but mostly I couldn‚Äôt afford more or was already at the limits and just stuck with the original plan for any given year.  If I had to do it all over again I would do pretty much the exact same thing, only I would have tried to put more in the Roth and less in the regular IRA and picked more aggressive index funds (aka Nasdaq index) for the Roth much earlier than I did. Having a bigger nut in an account where I could withdraw tax free would be great right now, but you can‚Äôt get everything 100% right and overall I‚Äôm super happy with the result.","(For reference I'm 65.)  I started investing when I was 20. Small amounts of course. For about 10 years I mostly copied what my dad was doing, which was active trading rather than real investing. I did put 10% of my money into an S&amp;P 500 fund and another 10% into an emerging growth fund. At times I was too busy to trade so the money would sit making just a bit of interest.  Around 30 years old I stopped doing much trading and started investing in stocks for the long term. Did OK with individual stocks but not great. Also kept putting money into the S&amp;P 500 fund. After several years of doing this I realized that my individual picks and the emerging growth fund weren't doing as well as my index fund. I got discouraged and more or less quit saving much.  In 2000, when I was 41, I decided I had to get serious again. I decided I didn't have the time or patience to buy, track, and occasionally sell individual stocks. But I didn't know how I wanted to approach investing. So I sold everything around the end of Q3 2000... which purely by luck happened to be a great time to sell. Then I got super busy with my consulting business, was billing over 200 hours per month and was having our dream home built. Life was a blur.   So when 9/11 happened I was still holding cash. The market shit itself and kept heading down for the next 18 months or so. My business dropped about 40%. I stayed mostly in cash during this time but I used my spare time to learn as much as I could about long term investing. I also looked back on my investments and it was clear to me that my best investment was the S&amp;P 500 index fund. So I decided to put all my money into an S&amp;P 500 ETF, Berkshire Hathaway and AT&amp;T and just leave it alone. I put about half into the index fund and one quarter each into BRKB and T. It took about a year to reinvest it all.  From 2003 until 2011 that's where I put all my savings. I invested every month regardless of whether the market was up or down. And it worked out great.  In 2011 as I saw retirement becoming a possibility I started reorienting my investments to income producing stocks. I started buying Hercules Capital and Main Street Capital along with a couple of REITs and a few other income stocks. I kept AT&amp;T but over a period of seven or so years Berkshire Hathaway and moved that money into income stocks. Sold AT&amp;T in 2018 / 2019 when they decided they'd become a media and content company, I knew they weren't going to pull that off.  Now I'm mostly in income stocks and quite happy with that. I still have about 10% in the S&amp;P 500 index ETF and I'm holding a fair amount in a Treasury money market because 5% at almost no risk is pretty attractive.  Honestly the best thing I could have done to build my wealth would have been to buy and hold the S&amp;P 500 until I was ready to retire, then move to the income world like I did.  I also bought two vacation rentals in 2017. Sold one in late 2021 and one in late 2023. I made an assload of money off of them but not as much as my stock investments. Real estate investing is nothing like stock investing though. It requires a very different mindset and you cannot be passive about it.  As to the last 4 or 5 years, I've slightly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 with much less volatility than it has had.  Since 2003 when I started over I've averaged 12.2%. During that time the S&amp;P 500 has averaged 12.0% including dividends. So again, it would have been waaaayyyy easier just to put all my money into an S&amp;P index fund until it was time to transition to income stocks for retirement.",Nothing fake about owning a piece of the company that sells half the world‚Äôs smartphones.

investing,Jun,1dqkb1a,Hedge-fund Manager Says Nvidia Will Hit a $6 Trillion Valuation by Year-end,"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hedge-fund-manager-says-nvidia-will-hit-6-trillion-valuation-year-end-1725152  Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson has made a bold prediction regarding Nvidia's stock performance, forecasting that it will reach $250 per share by the end of the year. This projection implies a potential upside of over 100% from its current trading levels, positioning Nvidia to achieve a remarkable $6 trillion valuation. Jackson, who utilises a proprietary AI and machine learning-driven algorithm at EMJ Capital to pick long and short tech equities, believes Nvidia's historic rally will continue throughout the year.  Jackson highlighted Nvidia's price-earnings (P/E) multiple trends over the past five years, noting that the average forward P/E multiple has been 40 times. Following the recent correction, the forward P/E was 39 times. Historically, Nvidia's P/E multiple has exceeded 50 times on three occasions and approached 70 times twice, indicating potential for further growth.  Jackson believes that as the market recognises the success of Blackwell chips in the second half of the year, coupled with favourable gross margins and the anticipation of upcoming Rubin chips, investor euphoria will drive Nvidia's valuation higher.  Jackson emphasised Nvidia's significant advantage over its rivals, dismissing comparisons to Cisco during the dot-com bubble as unfounded.","Translation.

investing,Jun,1dixsti,"Global top tech index adjusts its weightings: Apple falls to 4.5%, Nvidia rises to 21%","The large rise in Nvidia will force a large tech ETF to raise the weight of the company in its fund while cutting the weight of Apple significantly.  The S&amp;P Technology Select Industry Index (XLK) will soon rebalance after adjusting its value Friday's close. The S&amp;P Research Select Portfolio (SPDR) manager Matthew Bartolini said the index will be rebalanced after the adjustment, with Microsoft as its largest holding, followed by Nvidia and then Apple.  As a result, the weight of Microsoft and Nvidia will likely be around 21% while the weight of Apple will drop significantly to around 4.5%, Bartolini said.  This is different from the weight as of last week, when Nvidia's weight was significantly lower. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple each had about 22% of the fund, while Nvidia had only 6%.  All three companies have market caps of over $3.2 trillion after Friday's close.  The S&amp;P Technology Select Industry Index fund manages about $71 billion in assets, so a 15% change in the weight of a single stock in the fund is equivalent to over $10 billion in investment. SPDR said it would not comment on specific rebalancing trades.  The large shift in the S&amp;P Technology Select Industry Index fund is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can have divergent views, especially when the rally is so concentrated.  Bartolini explained: ""Understanding what their weighting methodology, allocation, and rebalancing frequency is, is important because it creates risk exposure differences and makes the content under the label look different by fund.""  The S&amp;P Technology Select Industry Index fund tracks the S&amp;P Technology Select Industry Index, which uses a floating adjustment calculation to determine its value.

investing,Jun,1dfu9x5,Small Cap Value has never been more brutal,"The amount of underperformance is unrivaled. Six month ago it was the first time since the 1940s that small cap value underperformed SP500 over a 20 year period.(perhaps even longer, but the chart I had doesnt go back that far). Since that six months, the underperformance has widened even further 25%.   The top 10 names in the sp500 have typically been \~19%, and was \~27% at the peak of various bubbles. Now, it sits at 37%.   All this when there are interest rate cute forecasts for this year and the following year, which tends to help small cap value outperform (with that said, I remember when rates were going to rise in like 2012. They stayed on the floor for a decade even though every analyst was predicting rises every step of the way, so you could absolutely find a scenario being stuck at higher rates for a long long time)  I have a lot of things to say about AI which I think is materially driving this gap, but perhaps I'll leave that for the comments.","One thing that‚Äôs rarely discussed in factor investing is the possibility that the small cap value premium may no longer exist despite having existed in the past for decades. There are plenty of reasonable theories for why the small cap value premium persisted for so long and may even continue to persist today, but ultimately it‚Äôs always possible that the market may have adapted. Personally I think that the small cap value premium still exists but can no longer be captured by shallow statistical measures of value used to construct value index funds. Actual value is the present value of future cash flows. Statistical value includes metrics like P/E, which modern algorithms already track.","This is partially AI. This is more a liquidity event. Liquidity is drying up and so money is chasing the tried and true vs disbursing into the broader market.  The cuts may not even provide this event like in the past as we may be on the cusp of a recession; which would have meant a sell off before hand since the market is forward looking. The good news is, the down shouldn‚Äôt be nearly as harsh as the S&amp;P",[deleted],"Expectations have changed for the retail investor, as more real-time tools have become available. I think more investors are doubling down on winners and having less patience/cutting losers faster. 6% YoY used to be pretty standard. Now, we're used to 10% every year.","I think the value factor is broken, and posted about it here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/EMeMI6tLzt  If you think of the S&amp;P500 (or whatever benchmark) as point B the the graph, buying lower value still means you're buying a bunch of stuff under the curve which underperforms.   &gt;Actual value is the present value of future cash flows.  PE ratios can be used as a proxy for NPV. Again, it doesn't account for growth. The value factor probably needs to be updated to capture growth somehow. Just as an example, a 12.5x PE and 0% growth will have the same returns as a company with 17x PE and 2% growth.","As someone who's been tilting his stocks 25% to small cap value for almost 15 years, yeah it's been brutal.  By now I don't even think about it though, I just rebalance occasionally.  When I started doing it I decided to stick with it for 30 years, so I have 15 years to go until I re-evaluate.  On the plus side, small value and international stocks do make me feel like I'm not putting all my money into something with crazy-high valuation.","If the value premium disappeared, you'd expect the value spread to be historically narrow. But in fact most of the poor performance of value from 2006 to 2021 is explained by the spread *widening*, and in 2021 the spread was the widest in history.

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)‚Äôs blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on¬†[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).  The index that the¬†[Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/)¬†follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday‚Äôs close. The new calculations show¬†[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)¬†as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.  All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.  As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.  That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia‚Äôs weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.     The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.  The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.  The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.  ‚ÄúUnderstanding how they might be weighted, where they‚Äôre allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what‚Äôs beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,‚Äù Bartolini said.  The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.  The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.  ‚ÄúIts free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,‚Äù Bartolini said.  The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.  On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

I now need to liquidate a considerable part of my portfolio for financial reasons. Only a part of the portfolio will remain. The question is whether AMD should be one of the select 4-5 stocks to hold for the long term, say 10-20 years - next to VUAA which will remain the major chunk of my portfolio.  What are your thoughts on this - is AMD really a hold for the long term? Or should I take my gains and begone with it?   Just for info: my other ""Hold"" stocks are MSFT, AAPL, MCD and maybe 1-2 others.","no one has crystal ball, let me recommend voo to you","Imho, The biggest threat to AMD right now isn't Nvidia...it's what's going on with the ARM processors beyond what started out as good mobile processor. Apple blazed the trail by successfully showing what a well developed ARM processor could do behind just the iPhone and into now laptops and now heavier weight desktop and server...  Qualcomms latest batch of snapdragon processors might actually gain some footing now too with the Snapdragon X Elite finding its way into laptops ....and this is going to pave the way for Samsung to follow  too with Exynos processors beyond mobile phones. I've worked with them before and they always wanted into in-source their own ARM processor into all their computing devices, it just wasn't as good as Qualcomms and probably still isn't.  This is also going to open the door for lower tier players like MediaTek to sell their ARM processor into the computing space.  So the competition for AMD has gotten much stiffer on the personal computing space because they aren't just going to be competing against Intel and Nvidia.   Windows 11 can run just fine with an ARM processor so this could pose a long term issue to the x86 architecture.  That said, I'm still an long term AMD shareholder...but these days I'm camping more out in TSM and SOXL.  Everyone uses TSM, even Intel is using TSM now for part of their chip fab","AMD should be a good one to keep. They have a far better technique to build their Chips than their direct adversary Intel and a good relationship with the current marketmaker NVDA.

If you read the quarterly reports and believe in the fundamentals long term, then why not keep holding?

The previous 1 year update is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) Interestingly, the stock I lamented missing the run up on (Nvidia) is now by biggest holding and one of my best performers.  # Tracking progress  Below are the gains for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of May 31, 2024.¬†  **Realized (sold)**  # 2023 Totals  * **Affirm (AFRM):**¬†+18.09% * **Allbirds (BIRD):**¬†+6.89% * **Coinbase (COIN):**¬†+6.42% * **Carvana (CVNA):**¬†+845.57% * **Meta (META):**¬†+256.36% * **Cloudflare (NET):**¬†+50.67% * **Netflix (NFLX):**¬†+122.39% * **Peloton (PTON):**¬†-71.51% * **Roblox (RBLX):**¬†+25.57% * **Shopify (SHOP):**¬†+51.27% * **Snapchat (SNAP):**¬†-1.99% * **Unity (U):**¬†+27.57%  All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD).¬†  Peloton was a big loser and the only one I almost immediately regretted, but it was a relatively small investment that was more than offset by others.¬†  # 2024 YTD  * **Roblox (RBLX):**¬†+42.66% * **Snowflake (SNOW):**¬†+51.57% * **Unity (U):**¬†-8.73%  **Unrealized (current investments)**  * **Amazon (AMZN):**¬†+75.50% * **Alphabet/Google (GOOGL):**¬†+81.73% * **Meta (META):**¬†+367.97% * **Netflix (NFLX):**¬†+229.81% * **Nvidia (NVDA):**¬†+117.05% * **Shopify (SHOP):**¬†+46.37% * **Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM):**¬†+60.76%  **Purchased in the last week/month**  I had extra cash, so I purchased small amounts of these in the last week or so:¬†  * **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):**¬†-2.98% * **ARM (ARM):**¬†-1.88% * **Intel (INTC):**¬†-1.42% * **Microsoft (MSFT):**¬†+2.32% * **Tesla (TSLA):**¬†-0.54%  I know these are all less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.¬†  # Rate of return  The total rate of return since inception (June 2022 to May 2024) is¬†**77.90%**.¬†  # 3 ways my investing evolved  I‚Äôm still well within the ‚Äòmaybe I‚Äôm just lucky‚Äô phase since it‚Äôs only been a couple years, but I‚Äôve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past:¬†  1. Insight¬† 2. Conviction¬† 3. Patience  **Insight**  I‚Äôve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).¬†  Ben Graham‚Äôs quote rings true:¬†  &gt;Benjamin Graham  Perhaps counterintuitively, I‚Äôve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.¬†  Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.¬†  # Math  In 2023 I also started¬†practicing math daily¬†(243 days straight¬†as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I‚Äôd done any meaningful math.¬†  I‚Äôm not sure how much, but it¬†*feels*¬†like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.¬†  **Conviction**  A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.¬†  However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.¬†  Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I‚Äôve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I‚Äôm not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I‚Äôm happy I did.¬†  A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.¬†  This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,¬†you must seize them.  **Patience**  As a result of my convictions, I‚Äôm much more patient in my investing these days and don‚Äôt react to the day-to-day.¬†  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I don‚Äôt make another trade for the rest of 2024.","Do you track a benchmark for comparison?

investing,Jun,1da9w4w,"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 272,000 in May, unemployment rate at 4.0%. ~ Bureau of Labor Statistics.","https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 272,000 in May, and the unemployment rate changed  little at 4.0 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Employment continued to trend up in several industries, led by health care; government; leisure and hospitality; and  professional, scientific, and technical services.  This news release presents statistics from two monthly surveys. The household survey measures  labor force status, including unemployment, by demographic characteristics. The establishment  survey measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. For more information about  the concepts and statistical methodology used in these two surveys, see the Technical Note.  Household Survey Data  Both the unemployment rate, at 4.0 percent, and the number of unemployed people, at 6.6 million,  changed little in May. A year earlier, the jobless rate was 3.7 percent, and the number of  unemployed people was 6.1 million. (See table A-1.)  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.8 percent), adult women  (3.4 percent), teenagers (12.3 percent), Whites (3.5 percent), Blacks (6.1 percent), Asians  (3.1 percent), and Hispanics (5.0 percent) showed little or no change in May. (See tables A-1,  A-2, and A-3.)  The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more), at 1.4 million,  changed little in May. The long-term unemployed accounted for 20.7 percent of all unemployed people. (See table A-12.)  Both the labor force participation rate, at 62.5 percent, and the employment-population ratio,  at 60.1 percent, were little changed in May. These measures showed little change over the year.  (See table A-1.)  The number of people employed part time for economic reasons, at 4.4 million, changed little  in May. These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part  time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs.  (See table A-8.)  In May, the number of people not in the labor force who currently want a job, at 5.7 million,  was little changed. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not  actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take  a job. (See table A-1.)  Among those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of people marginally attached  to the labor force, at 1.5 million, was little changed in May. These individuals wanted and  were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not  looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a  subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, edged up  to 462,000 over the month. (See Summary table A.)  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 272,000 in May, higher than the average monthly  gain of 232,000 over the prior 12 months. In May, employment continued to trend up in several  industries, led by health care; government; leisure and hospitality; and professional,  scientific, and technical services. (See table B-1.)  Health care added 68,000 jobs in May, in line with the average monthly gain of 64,000 over  the prior 12 months. In May, employment growth continued in ambulatory health care services  (+43,000), hospitals (+15,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+11,000).  Government employment continued to trend up in May (+43,000), in line with the average  monthly growth over the prior 12 months (+52,000).  Employment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in May (+42,000), similar to the  average monthly gain over the prior 12 months (+35,000). Employment in food services and  drinking places continued to trend up over the month (+25,000).  Professional, scientific, and technical services added 32,000 jobs in May, higher than the  average monthly gain of 19,000 over the prior 12 months. Over the month, employment increased  in management, scientific, and technical consulting services (+14,000) and in architectural,  engineering, and related services (+10,000). Specialized design services lost 3,000 jobs.  Social assistance employment continued to trend up in May (+15,000), primarily in individual  and family services (+11,000). Over the prior 12 months, social assistance had added an average  of 22,000 jobs per month.  In May, employment in retail trade continued to trend up (+13,000), about in line with the  average monthly gain over the prior 12 months (+8,000). Building material and garden equipment  and supplies dealers added 12,000 jobs in May, while job losses occurred in department stores  (-5,000) and furniture and home furnishings retailers (-4,000).  Employment showed little or no change over the month in other major industries, including mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; construction; manufacturing; wholesale trade; transportation  and warehousing; information; financial activities; and other services.  In May, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 14 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $34.91. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.1  percent. In May, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees  increased by 14 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $29.99. (See tables B-3 and B-8.)   The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls remained at 34.3 hours in May.  In manufacturing, the average workweek was unchanged at 40.1 hours, while overtime edged up to 3.0  hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls  edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.8 hours. (See tables B-2 and B-7.)   The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for March was revised down by 5,000, from +315,000  to +310,000, and the change for April was revised down by 10,000, from +175,000 to +165,000. With  these revisions, employment in March and April combined is 15,000 lower than previously reported.  (Monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies  since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.)","Simple, I just ignore the revisions that don't conform to the narrative I want to push.","&gt; Also the revisions, lol.

Especially if inflation is still sticking above 2% there's no reason to cut rates.,Thank you for leaving out the seasonal adjustment factors! Definitely not a bad faith comment!

investing,Jun,1doemzd,How best to capitalize on the next 10-20 years of Mexican manufacturing growth? ,"I've been researching the future macro trends of the global manufacturing chain and strongly believe that Mexico has the greatest opportunity for incredible growth in the coming decades. Similar to what happened in China 20 years ago.   That said what stocks, etfs, etc should I be looking at to capitalize on that growth for the next 10-20 years?",Just an anecdote that seems to support your thesis‚Ä¶the company I work for has a manufacturing facility in Mexico. Recently we cannot keep employees because they keep moving to new jobs nearby for higher pay. Just a lot of local competition for skilled and unskilled manufacturing labor. Difficult to keep pace with local pay to retain people. We‚Äôre neck deep in work to support their production and travel down to help fill in for people who have left.,I'd just invest in US multinationals since they'll likely be the main beneficiaries if your thesis is true.,"I agree with this thesis and I have been commenting about it for several years, mostly in /r/stocks. My investments are: $CP, $PAC, $OMAB, and $BLX.  In my opinion $PAC/$OMAB are the most direct bet on the growth of the Mexican middle class. They have been punished recently because of political interference and the perception that Sheinbaum may continue interfering.  $CP offers more safety since it's majority in USA/Canada but by extension the least amount of exposure to specifically Mexican growth.  $BLX is a broader bet on LatAm that I think is very intriguing and also offers diversification as a financial.  I'm always looking for more options in this vein so curious to see other responses.","Thanks for the intel, I started to get very intrigued after watching some of the videos Peter Zeihan had on YouTube. He's a demographor and his points are very very convincing.","Most of the companies paying more are from America, China, Japan, etc.   I‚Äôd definitely dive deep into the numbers due to that because every Mexican firm is not going to be able to compete with that foreign multinational money. That said the biggest winners will be Mexican workers.","Have you been to northern Mexico or are you familiar with manufacturing in Mexico?  My first thought is that most of the companies there are multinational companies that open factories there. I'm not sure if there are many Mexican owner companies who have opened plants. With that, I'd look into automotive suppliers like Magna, Forvia or Flex &amp; Gate. There are countless but that might be an avenue. Again, most of those companies are European or US/Canadian.  I won't pretend to be an expert but I spent 12 weeks over 4 trips in Hermosillo so I've got a little bit of on the ground experience.  I will say I am bullish on Mexican engineers. They have some excellent schools down there and a lot of American companies have been sponsoring work Visas for Mexican engineers.  I could be mistaken but I don't know if any companies that are specific to Mexico that would be part of the manufacturing boom that's been happening there for the past 20 years.","This is a solid point.. which leads me to ask, any recommendations for a US multinational that has its focus on Mexican manufacturing?",Without getting political my thesis does not include a trump presidency.,This is a very intriguing investment thesis and possibly not just for manufacturing but also for technology near shoring. My company recently moved what had traditionally been work reserved for offshore teams in India to Mexico because the time zone is so much more convenient to work with and the skill sets as well as English language proficiency exists in big numbers in Mexico.,"The older I get, the more I believe that the S&amp;P 500 owns the world and that wasting your time on anything other than VOO or IVV is basically gambling rather than investing.  I don't even believe in small-caps and total market funds anymore.  That being said... lol... I happen to own a small chunk of EWW.  Basically my ""Duolingo bet"", that I bought a year ago because I was learning Spanish and vacationing in Mexico was personally excited.  Just a little piece of play money that won't hurt me to see decline, but which gives me an excuse to pay attention to the country.  Very volatile.  I was up around 60%... and then markets didn't like the most recent Presidential election results (even though the winner was universally predicted to win by a large margin), and it plunged double-digits overnight after Election Day.  It's a fun little holding.  But it hasn't beaten the S&amp;P 500 over the past 20 years, and I'm skeptical that it will do so in the next 20.  Ultimately, the Mexican stock market is mostly consumer staples and basic materials.  Even ""growth"" in those sectors is unlikely to outpace that of our technology, finance, and healthcare driven domestic index."

Looking to possibly diversify but stay very safe. ,Looking to keep my initial investment of 13k in a GIC earning 4% compounding daily for the next 30 years until retirement age. Am scared to loose it. Will continue to save. Am able to save up to 1k a month in my current new living working situation. I have done some research but am really not sure what to do. In Canada. Very paranoid about stocks and crypto. Considering just setting up another GIC every month or so. I can get them in denominations of $500 or more and redeem anytime. It's seems to be the best rate my bank has. Lots of room in TFSA and RRSP. What are some other ideas for safe investments?

I had to google GIC and it looks like a Canadian thing so disclaimer: I'm not Canadian.  If that is 4% guaranteed for a 30-year term then I think you're being very poorly rewarded for a helluva lot of risk you're taking. 30-year gilts are paying 4.7% and I wouldn't regard that as acceptable, either - there's a very decent chance that rates will substantially exceed 4% over this term and you'll be locked into a rate much less than you could get in the bank, losing money to inflation. Interest rates have exceeded this for most of the last 800 years - the low rates of the 2010's were historically anomalous.   You say you've done some research, but I don't really believe you. What was the name of the book? Why didn't you just name it in your submission text?  Stocks and crypto? Can I be blunt? It is ridiculous and childish to lump these together as if they are two comparable things. I doubt there has been any 20-year period of history in which the stockmarket has failed to generate positive returns - probably the majority of 20-year periods you would have doubled your money in a diversified portfolio of stocks (you can look this up for yourself and check it). In the terms of conventional finance, crypto has no historical performance - an asset class can out- or under-perform for a decade at a time, and crypto has barely a decade of ""history""; in 20 years' time, if crypto is still around, it will be a young assert class. Why didn't you just buy gold instead of 4% bonds? (not serious)  Just read a book about investing. Probably *The Little Book of Common Sense Investing* or *The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing* from [this list](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Book_recommendations_and_reviews), or both of them.  It's understandable that if you watch a handful of different YouTube videos, how can you judge which of them is giving reputable advice and which is selling snake oil?  The guy who's advocating crypto or telling you to buy gold because the whole fiat system is a house of cards - he can sound just as authoritative and convincing as the guy giving you genuine and legitimate financial advice. Probably the shysters can sound more legit, because genuine and correct financial advice is boring, and only nerds are interested in it - maybe the good advice on YouTube is delivered haltingly, with a nasal accent or low-quality video production.  Stop taking advice from social media until you've read a good book on investing - one of those I mentioned. Be evidence-orientated - the books I mentioned cite studies.",You fear what you don't understand.,"With how risk-adverse OP is, I'd probably suggest something more like a targeted date fund, then moving to a VT equivalent before going all-in on VOO.

But definitely keep an emergency fund.","""very paranoid about stocks and crypto"" Be aware that these two are very different in terms of risk, both short and long term.

investing,Jun,1dmzxml,"how do people feel about selling their ""losers""? ","I used to find it quite painful to have a losing stock. Over time I diversified and so I have some winners (big winners in the case of tech), and then a number of losers. As long as the overl $ of winners outweighs the losers I can sleep fairly easy at night.   With that said, I still find it difficult to sell the losers, thinking they will at some point get back to the price point I projected. As a result, I suspect I lose out on shifting my investment from the losing stock (that might go up by 10%), to a new stock that has better prospects.   Does anyone have advice on to better do this? I use some tools like seeking alpha, and financial news for projections but it's hard to force me to sell.",Tax break,"I think you always have to keep in mind that over time 85% of returns will come from 15% of stocks.  Since it is not easy to pick those top 15%, you are going to make many, many mistakes.  The smart thing to do is to reduce those bottom 85% stocks if you are reasonably well convinced that they will not make it to the top15%.  Making mistakes is a part of being human and nothing to be ashamed of.  The thing to be ashamed of is a failure to admit your mistakes and correct them.","Yes I have advice. Buy stocks you have high conviction on due to your own extensive research. If something happens to lower your conviction, selling is easy.

Maybe focus less on hitting your original price target and more on whether something better exists for your money now?",If you do that you would have sold Nvidia when it was -50% a few years ago before it went +3000%,"it does two things.   Capital loss can offset capital gains:  So if you had $300 in capital gains and $100 in capital losses, then you only pay taxes on $200 of the gains.  If capital losses are greater than gains, it can offset up to $3000 per year of ordinary income.  You can ""bank"" losses and use $3K each year until it's used up.  So it's not much, but helps.  $3K at 32% tax bracket is $960 saved on taxes.  Plus, whatever state tax that might be."

You're going to get wildly different answers based on people's location (and thus housing prices), age of person and when they purchased a house (a 30 year old who just purchased a house will have a wildly different answer than a 50 year old who now has much more equity in their house and a much longer time to invest as well).    In the end all that matters is having a plan for how much money you need or want in retirement, and then sticking to and executing that plan, and letting those numbers guide when and what you can afford for housing.",maybe half of my net worth is home equity...but thinking about it in terms of balance feels pointless since the home equity portion really isn't something i can change.  i bought my house ten years ago and can't imagine selling it for at least another 15 so i only really think about my equity when i want to tell myself i'm a millionaire lol.,I don‚Äôt even count my equity of my home.

For example if I had $10 in the bank, $1000 in brokerage, and a single 1 ounce American Gold Eagle (worth about $2500), but I lived in a house worth $10 million with a remaining mortgage of $1 million, does it make sense to say my net worth is only $3510? Absolutely not. I dont NEED to live in that particular house and any time I want I can sell it, downgrade to something reasonable, and take the cash and deploy it in the stock market. A house is both an asset and a dwelling.

Then in 6 months' time, the stock will be automatically bought for her. At a discound using the price at either time of purchase or sign on time, which ever is lower.  Either way, it's free money since she gets it at a discount. She could turn around and sell and take the profit, but incurring short term capital gains tax rate. Or hold on. Or sell a portion.

The new target implies a roughly 3% advance in the gauge from its Friday close.Goldman‚Äôs upgraded target ties with that from UBS Group AG‚Äôs Jonathan Golub and BMO Capital Markets‚Äô Brian Belski for the highest on Wall Street.The upgrade in the target is ‚Äúdriven by milder-than-average negative earnings revisions and a higher fair value P/E multiple,‚Äù Kostin, the firm‚Äôs chief US equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.    The upgrade comes one month after Kostin reiterated the firm‚Äôs 5,200 target, stating there was no further room for upside in the 500-member gauge through December. The firm‚Äôs strategists first introduced their 2024 target in¬†November, before¬†raising¬†it in December and again in¬†February. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 5,431.60 on Friday.While the firm‚Äôs strategists maintained their earnings-per-share forecast for 2024 and 2025, they noted that robust earnings growth by the top five megacap technology stocks have offset the ‚Äútypical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.‚Äù Kostin also raised the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs price-earnings multiple he deems fair to 20.4 from 19.5.    Kostin gamed out several other scenarios in which stocks can run even higher than his new baseline forecast. If gains broaden out and lift the S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index, the main, cap-weighted benchmark could rise another 9% to 5,900 before 2024 closes out. In his most optimistic case, if mega-cap ‚Äúexceptionalism‚Äù persists, the gauge could soar to 6,300 by the end of the year.Conversely, if earnings estimates prove too optimistic or recession fears resurface among investors, the S&amp;P 500 could see a correction of about 13% and fall to 4,700.

investing,Jun,1d8cjsw,Inheriting 89 acres of land in rural South Carolina,"Inheriting 89 acres of land in rural South Carolina  My grandfather obtained 89 acres of land in rural SC (about 70ish miles southeast of Charlotte, NC) from war bonds he bought decades ago. The land has been cleared of trees and has a bit of running water on it.   He is leaving the land in his will to his children. I am his grandchild. One of the conditions in the will is that we cannot sell the land. It has to stay within our families possession but outside of that we can do whatever we want with it. We want to find a way to make money with the land.  Our current idea is use 3-5 acres to build a cabin, maybe add some cool stuff like a shooting range? We can stay there ourselves and rent it out on AirBnB/VRBO. With the rest of the land we could set up a solar panel farm or rent the land out on a lease to a company who wants to use it for some sort of carbon offset credit endeavor. We think those would be the easiest ways to make money off the land without too much upfront cost (we‚Äôd probably make money from the land and THEN build a cabin somewhere on the land). We had had friends/family suggest we turn some of the land into private hunting land and allow people to pay us to come shoot there.   Does anyone have any ideas on the best way to profit off of this land? It feels like we haven‚Äôt been handed straight gold here and we‚Äôll have some work to do, but this is an incredible opportunity and we want to make the most of it.  Thanks in advance!","All the things you are suggesting are businesses with multiple people and their spouses. People get married, divorced and die. I really suggest you think  this over. Your family isn't special, expect fights and relationships ruined. This is just a very bad situation. It's just a horrible idea to will multiple people ownership of something like this.  You're going to need capital to get any business going. What if everyone but you is broke and can't afford it? They still get income from it?  It's not uncommon to have hunting accidents. I've known people to fall out of stands and accidental shootings happen.  You spoken to a lawyer about protecting personal assets? What if some heirs can't afford a lawyer for this?

The situation will fall apart soon enough.  No one can be forced to own something. If the children are indeed equal co-owners, one (or more) can sue for a partition sale and force the land to be sold so they can cash out their share if no one can or will buy out their share.

The company was moving cities, CEO came in and announced it, laid everyone off with no notice. I was angry, some words were had.   Anyways, I‚Äôm trying to get information from him about the company. The same thing I‚Äôd expect to get for my publicly held stocks. Nothing crazy. Mostly I‚Äôm just inquiring about the business and trying to get information on when the annual shareholders meeting is.   So the problem is, the CEO seems to have gone no contact with me. Won‚Äôt reply to texts, phone calls, emails, nada.   I‚Äôm pretty peeved. I know I have rights, even as a minority shareholder. If it was a public company, I‚Äôd know what to do, but this is my first time running into this problem holding shares in a private corporation.   What do I do?

If you could go back in time would you max out your IRA or continue your investment strategy as is? My husband has a high salary and since we file jointly I don‚Äôt think I qualify for Roth. Would you max out your IRA?,Getting tax advantages is generally a good thing.,[deleted],"Compared to what? If you're not maxing it out either you can't afford to save enough, or you're prioritizing a taxable investment account. If the money is intended for retirement there's no reason for it not to be in a tax advantaged account if you have the option. If you're not saving in a taxable account and not maxing out tax advantaged contributions, then the question isn't about where to save, but how much to save, and that has nothing to do with contribution limits.","Yeah I would, but of course after maxing out my 401k first. Your question makes it sound like IRA is your priority.",Ira and 401k are pretty much the same after you get your full employee match,The 401k has more protections legally in lawsuits etc there are other small differences.,"If the money is for retirement there's no benefit to having it in a taxable account and the con of having it tied up is irrelevant.  A 401k is just one type of tax advantaged account, if there's no company match there's no incentive to prioritize that over an ira. An ira works just like your brokerage, you can invest in whatever you want, and there are no taxes until you start taking distributions after retirement age. Even if you use the 401k, as long as there's at least one broad market fund that doesn't have a high expense ratio, there's nothing wrong with dumping a chunk of your savings in that. You have an overall allocation in mind and you can adjust in other places to account for the limited choices in the 401k.  Any tax advantaged account has the benefit of paying no tax on gains until the money is withdrawn. The trade off is the limits on accessing that money prior to retirement age. Right now, your taxable accounts, you're paying tax on capital gains from a sale, or dividends even if you don't take money out of the account. If you decide aapl is overvalued and sell half your position for 10,000 gains tomorrow and then reinvest all of the money from the sale into another asset, you're paying tax on that 10,000 this year even though it's all still invested, so that money for the taxes needs to come from somewhere else.",I don‚Äôt make enough to max out my 401k so I try my best to max out my Roth IRA everyyear,Backdoor roth,"Yes, that's a 401k.

Are you concerned the next application of chips would not be as big as AI? Seeing a slow down in moore's law?

NVDA and ARM's current prices are based on projections some time in the future that the current trend of sales/return will continue or accelerate at a similar rate as it has. While Semiconductors and chips will always be important in our society what happens if:  * AI boom plateaus, and losers fall off and stop buying and only a few winners remain? * AMD make a competitor that is worthy of NVDA's market shares such that an 80% profit margin is no longer valid  I'm sure all of these factors are somewhat prices in, but still.

It‚Äôs full of boom and bust. Rinse and repeat. It‚Äôs super important for sure but not more important than food, air and water. These will be needed longer than chips. You cannot live without food for a week. Maybe you should buy food air and water instead?",Are chips not a food ü§î,"The market is hungrier than ever for chips and processing capacity and it won't be slowing down anytime soon,   Moore's law might now necessarily apply and we'll likely see slopes in innovation happen but in terms of present value of future cashflows Nvidia and co will continue being category leaders. Expect short term volatility in the sector due to supply chain, geopol, and other issues but long term these companies will do well.","The risk is that to achieve 10%+ returns over the next decade, Nvidia will have to grow earnings at 50%+ a year. For a decade. It currently has $80b in sales. At 50% a year for a decade, its sales would be $4.6 trillion in today‚Äôs dollars in 2034. So basically, if you invest in Nvidia today hoping to beat the market, you‚Äôre making a bet that they can achieve $4.6 trillion in annual sales in 10 years. Does this sound like a bet where the odds are in your favor?","It can be a good company and industry, but doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll be a good investment.","That was the original concept for the Matrix, but they changed it because at the time the concept of a batterie was much easier to understand for the average viewer than cpu!","yes, this is probably the right answer","Interesting ideas.

investing,Jun,1dmlcom,What's the appeal for dividend ETF/stocks at young age?,"Unless I'm using this website I correctly (https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio), why would anyone who has 20yrs until retirement buy a dividend focused fund or stock for that matter. I ran SCHD and VYM against the SPY and VTSAX from 2019 until now and both the SPY and VTSAX beats any dividend ETF. What am I missing?","Dividends don't matter. Total return matters. Total return includes dividends, they are one component. People act like dividends are free money, but there's plenty of research to show that they are no different from selling part of your investment.  The main thing big dividend companies have is there is a strong correlation between companies that prioritize a dividend and companies that are big, stable, etc. they won't grow as fast, but they pay out their profits to shareholders regularly. You get less volatility from these companies, but they are not empirically better than others.","Simply, people don‚Äôt understand that the dividend is coming from their own money. They think it‚Äôs paid to them like interest.",You‚Äôre not missing anything.,"Dividends are taxed like long term capital gains if qualified, i.e., if you've held the stock paying the dividend for 60 days of the 121 day period starting 60 days before the ex-dividend date. Some securities' dividends (e g., REITs) are always unqualified, though.",This I‚Äôm so tired of people on the dividend sub acting like you can‚Äôt own both. People will yield chase but result in a net negative value in their portfolio. The whole idea is the invest in good companies period. What ever generates the best results,A lot of novice investors don‚Äôt understand corporate governance and what owning a share of stock represents. They don‚Äôt understand the concept that shareholders own the company. They think management is on a different team when in reality the CEO is hired by the board which in turn is elected by shareholders.   I‚Äôve had to explain many times that issuing new shares to raise funds is not always a bad thing and the new investors/owners pay cash in exchange for those shares.,Lmao dude is so close to getting it,"Dividends aren't free money though. The main benefit is that the companies that are most dividend focused tend to handle downturns better. Dividends take money away from the company, driving down the share price by roughly the same amount as the dividend, making it the equivalwnt of selling shares. Having a good bond allocation is a good way to weather the storm.","Besides dividends, the other thing a company can do is ""buy backs"".  This buys back shares which generally increases price, since there are less outstanding shares to trade on open market (ie, it reduces the supply of shares of  supply and demand market, everything else being equal)  --  grow is also better tax wise than dividends.  Dividends get taxed as ordinary income, even if you reinvest.  Capital gains, if held for 1 year or more, are taxed as long term capital gains, which is generally lower than ordinary income tax for most people.  You would have to do math for your specific income level and state taxes - but it's typically much more efficient on average.",NVIDIA has a pretty wild chart.   Why invest in anything but nvidia?

investing,Jun,1dd0a6r,Fiverr - An unfairly beaten down 'pandemic stock'? An Investment Thesis for what currently looks like a contrarian bet. ,"# Context  A lot of pandemic era stocks lacked basic unit economics, and were found out when the funding stopped and subsequently collapsed.  Some had network effects / unit economics, but needed to ‚Äòget fit‚Äô (think Uber and Meta), some have righted their mid-pandemic wrongs with clear turnaround / value creation plans and been rewarded (think Carvana), and some have righted the wrongs but not yet been rewarded. I think¬†**Fiverr ($FVRR)**¬†sits in this latter category.  Fiverr is a leading freelance marketplace which connects businesses with freelancers offering a wide range of services.  # About the company  Founded in 2010 by Micha Kaufman and Shai Winiger in Tel Aviv, Fiverr operates a two-sided marketplace matching small businesses with freelancers.  With approximately 700 employees, Fiverr is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ($FVRR) and had a market cap of just under $1 billion in June 2024, down from about $11 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic.  **Problem statement Fiverr solves**  Fiverr transforms the opaque and inefficient process of hiring freelancers into a modern, user-friendly e-commerce experience.  **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**  Fiverr offers an easy-to-use platform where people can buy and sell small services for a flat starting fee. The platform boasts a comprehensive catalogue of services and well-vetted freelancers.  **Potential sources of network effects:**  * **Buyers**: Around 4 million buyers, with approximately 65% of core marketplace revenue from repeat buyers, indicating sustained user engagement. * **Service Categories**: Over 700 freelance service categories, including recent additions like AI content and development. Gigs range from $5 to $50,000. * **Freelancers**: Approximately 400,000 active freelance sellers.  # Investment Thesis  **Star Company**  Fiverr operates in a profitable and growing market niche (SMB freelance digital services) with growth exceeding 10% per year. It is a leader in its niche, matching freelancers to smaller SMEs effectively. This makes it a ‚ÄòStar Company‚Äô.  # Reasons why I think the stock will rise:  1. **Overly Beaten-Down Tech Stock**: Fiverr, has seen its share price decline by over 90% from its February 2021 peak. This significant drop ‚Äì which has also recently been exacerbated by the geopolitical concerns in Israel and Palestine and the disruptive impact of AI on its business ‚Äì is a common trend among tech stocks that were COVID-19 beneficiaries. What seems to have been overlooked is Fiverr retains a very viable and growing business post pandemic. 2. **Shift to Profitability and Cash Generation**: Fiverr‚Äôs growth has slowed to approximately 10% year-over-year as it has pivoted its focus towards profitability and cash generation, addressing investor demand for a focus on fundamentals. This strategic shift is reflected in improved bottom-line results, including free cash flow (FCF) and earnings per share (EPS), underpinned by key performance indicators like higher average ticket sizes and growing gross margins. 3. **Attractive Valuation Metrics**: Following recent share price pressures, Fiverr currently trades at a 2024 forecast earnings/enterprise value multiple that is attractive (c. 8.6x) given its 10% growth rate and acceleration in key value creation metrics, including EPS, FCF per share, and return on invested capital (ROIC). 4. **AI concerns appear overblown**: Investors are concerned AI will disrupt the services provided by freelancers on Fiverr‚Äôs platform, but Fiverr‚Äôs Q1 2024 results exceeded expectations, leading to raised guidance for the full year. Management has highlighted the net positive impact of AI on the business. 5. **Stable Take Rate and Financial Resilience**: Fiverr‚Äôs take rate remains stable at 30%, it has a $304m net cash position, and the company is free cash flow positive, providing significant financial resilience. I.e. it has gotten beyond ‚Äòdefault alive‚Äô. 6. **Dynamic Macro Environment**: While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging with constrained budgets in large enterprises and financial pressures on small businesses, Fiverr‚Äôs high exposure to smaller businesses positions revenues to rebound quickly as conditions improve. 7. **Share Buyback Program**: In May 2024, Fiverr initiated a $100 million share buyback program, reflecting management‚Äôs belief that the stock is undervalued. They are confident in their cash position and free cash flow generation to support this initiative. 8. **Large Short Float:**¬†The short float was around 10% as of June 2024, indicating the possibility of large upwards price moves if sentiment on the stock changes, as I think it should.  Overall, Fiverr‚Äôs strategic focus on profitability, robust financial health, and proactive management of market challenges make it a compelling investment opportunity.  # Things I Don‚Äôt Like About the Stock  1. **Share-Based Compensation (SBC):**¬†The level of share-based compensation appears excessive and results in significant dilution. Deducting SBC from free cash flow results in a near zero number, meaning free cash flow per share is not trending up as quickly as desired. 2. **AI Cannibalization threat**: AI has the potential to cannibalize certain services offered on Fiverr, such as logo design and article writing, which could impact revenue. 3. **Buyer Trends**: While the number of buyers has been declining, this has been offset by an increase in the average purchase price. This trend is concerning and needs to be monitored.  Overall - looks like a decent at current prices. It currently trades at $24.5. Analyst expectations are $26 on the low end and $45 at the high. My target is late $30s  I placed a limit buy order at $24.5, which filled last night. At the same time I also took a position in Upwork, which has the same business model but is focussed on larger customers and is perhaps better equipped for AI implementation type services.",What is worrisome for fiver I think is that the small gig jobs that people used to pay for from anything like a small mod to a css to drawing a logo can all be done with ChatGPT or equivalent rendering many of these obsolete.,Canva + ChatGPT + Dall-E/Firefly/etc. = Fiverr is fucked  fact is those services are cheap/free and provide a superior service to paying some rando Indonesian $5 to make a shitty business card,Honestly I feel bad for these folks - some of them genuinely have talent but is just sraping by bc they were born in the wrong country. Worrisome for them.,"I use Fiverr at work pretty often. I wish AI was as far along as people say, but I‚Äôve run into quite a few problems that it‚Äôs not good at and I‚Äôll continue to use Fiverr. The PE on this stock is a little concerning at over 100‚Ä¶","The problem with Fiverr is that, fundamentally, its business model is a race to the bottom. It creates forces of intense competition between freelancers on its platform, which drives project prices down. Fiverr, in turn, can only grow its margin by taking a larger cut from the freelancer's earnings. And the potential for that is capped too.  It would be a lot better if Fiverr was doing something that would allow freelancers to charge more for their work, all the while creating platform features that make it worthwhile for customers to stick with it, instead of going to the next lowest cost provider. In that scenario, Fiverr's revenue as a cut of freelancer's earnings would grow as the earnings increase.","But they already have lol they've put the entire graphic design industry into a race to the bottom, and Fiverr was already the bottom  You should go check out Canva, a literal moron could use it it's so simple. Fiverr involves having to work with some third world designer who may or may not provide a decent service. Hell, most of them just basically do the Canva work for you. Fiverr has no moat, in a shrinking industry, that's first on the firing line as far as AI is concerned.   By 2030 I have no doubt you will be able to input the design you want + your verbiage and AI will spit out a ""good enough"" flyer/yard sign/e-flyer/whatever, and ""good enough"" is what Fiverr was about","All points made on this post so far aside.  What about the risk of its location? A little bit more risky than in previous years, let's say.","Thanks for your thoughts. It's this type of logic which makes it a contrarian bet.       I agree AI is a risk to watch, but I also extensively use AI tools (specifically Midjourney, Firefly and GPT 4) - and there are shortcomings across all these services for the Fiverr gigs they threaten.       For example, logo design is an obvious area for disruption, but Dall-E/Midjourney don't give you vector file output etc. You'd need a conversion tool for that which is an extra step. If you're a small start-up, why not just pay someone $100 to do it properly on Fiverr.    Equally, i've used Midjourney a lot for architectural, landscape and interior design inspiration, but it's never going to precisely generate to your dimensions, or draw your CAD designs. Ultimately I had to pay for a landscape designer (a gig) to get something I could actually give to a contractor.   There are also 2 AI upsides to factor:    (1) the freelancers leveraging the tools are going to way more productive and efficient and produce higher quality, which can drive business in their direction, and    (2) AI implementation services, which are growing at 100% and 50% at Fiverr and Upwork respectively.   Overall, the latest results for Fiverr and Upwork show a re-acceleration in revenue, not a deceleration.","Thanks - helpful comments re your experience with Fiverr and AI.  You are right re trailing PE - this looks 'bad' / 'high' in part as they have only recently transitioned to positive earnings.       The forward (next 12 month) valuations are, as of 11 June: PE 10.5x, EV / EBITDA 8.7, EV / FCF 7.8. I think the analyst's EV / EBITDA is an adjusted EBITDA (i.e. takes out SBC) so might want to take that with a pinch of salt.","I'm not sure how to fix it, but Fiverr needs to pivot to stay in business long-term. With so much uncertainty, I feel there are better investments in other companies."
investing,Jun,1dm5oqg,Should you max out 401k even if the investing options aren‚Äôt that good?,I just started a new job that 100% matches up to 3% and also a 50% match on 1 more percent.  I‚Äôll obviously going to put at least 4% of my check into my 401k to get the match benefits.   Problem is the options to invest in aren‚Äôt that good. The best option I could find was COFYX which is pretty weak compared to VOO/VTI.  Is it a better option to put even more money into the 401k that won‚Äôt be matched that will be invested into COFYX. Or is it better to only invest until they stop matching so I can put the rest into VOO or VTI?,Most 401k should have some form of S&amp;P 500 index fund or a US large cap.,"Start with the 4% to the employer 401K, then contribute the max to a Roth IRA/IRA, the if you want to put more into your retirement investments go back to the 401K.",My current 401k has some pretty mediocre choices. Look at the prospectus for those you can‚Äôt readily identify. I finally found one that‚Äôs just the S&amp;P 500 index which is what I wanted. It was called something dumb like ‚ÄúEmployee Investment Index Portfolio‚Äù. You couldn‚Äôt tell what it was without reading the prospectus.,"How much do you want to save for retirement?  $7000, or $20000?  If you're in a position where you can sock away $X or $3X, wouldn't you want to do the latter?

I was under the understanding that it was \~$4k/$8k.,Could you invest the remains funds into a IRA or HSA? Personal finance has a good flow chart that breaks this sort of thing down.,I believe it is ~4/8 for HSA.,"This is a good answer.  If you are also on a high ductable health plan, you can put $7K into an HSA ($14K if married).  HSAs are really nice, google them.  Tax deferred.   But basically kind of like an IRA but can withdraw without penalty for any qualified medical expense.  Once you turn 65 you can withdraw from them without restrictions (no penalties, but pay taxes).","A major difference is that traditional has RMDs, and Roth doesn't.  Essentially you want enough taxable investments in retirement to fully consume your standard deduction. Then enough non taxable to cover the rest, essentially avoiding most tax burden.  But the balance is a guessing game since literally any year the laws can change.  This is the one place a financial advisor is really useful.","Or, after the ROTH IRA, consider HSA contributions."

Any input is appreciated!",S&amp;P keeps going up either way,"General misnomer, the President has little influence on the economy.  The non-elected Federal Reserve Chairman and board have the greatest influence.","The first months of Trump will be amazing, because of the perception of him being favorable to wallstreet, the rich and retail sees him as a business man.   Biden,  he did well thus far.  Better than  Trump on many key metrics jobs, employment, GDP etc   The first year of a new president will largely be influenced by the previous admin,  there is no such thing as a magic wand (like Trump pretends executive orders are).   The global economy is of importance too,  rate cats are happening in UK and Europe.    Here is the kicker.  Trump will not have Covid to hide behind. Trump has f√©d up a lot. Mexico did not pay for a wall, he ran up the deficit,  his tariffs backfired  and caused a massive farmer bail-out.    People THINK Trump did well,  but reality is that Covid caused people to stay at home, and thus spending was less. Credit scores improved, debt was paid and stock market participation boomed.

investing,Jun,1dlg3ag,Does anyone not automatically reinvest?,"I've always set my investments to automatically reinvest, kind of a set it and forget it method of investing.  But today I started to reconsider the idea.  If instead you pool the resources maybe you'd make different decisions.  Maybe money sitting there would be useful for purchases or expenses.  Maybe there's a new stock you'd like to jump into.    I'd love to hear from people who don't automatically reinvest.  Why do you take the money, and what do you use it for?","I turn it off for certain, individual stocks if I don't want more shares, and instead use the money to buy shares. Most of the time I DRIP, though.","I'm guessing when you said ""automatically reinvest,"" you are referring to DRIP, as in auto reinvesting the dividends back into the original stock. Depending on your portfolio, it can make reinvestment easier. However, if you want to maintain a set allocation, DRIP is generally bad because it throws away a free opportunity to rebalance your portfolio.  For example, lets say you have a simple portfolio that holds 50% domestic and 50% international total market. Both pay 2% dividends. In one year, the domestic market gains a lot, while the international market is stagnant. Your allocation becomes skewed 55% domestic and 45% international. But if you remain convinced that the 50/50 allocation is optimal, then you'll need to rebalance by selling some domestic and/or adding more funds to international. One ""free"" way to rebalancing is to use the dividends you get to purchase the underweighted areas. If you use DRIP, you will likely be purchasing more of the overweight areas, which will cause more portfolio skew.","I only DRIP inside tax-deferred accounts, as the investments inside are mostly set it and forget it, and then I rebalance every time I make a deferral/contribution. In my taxable account, I like to make more decisions and do not set anything to automatically invest.","I never do drip. It can be great, but it inadvertently also decreases diversification. I use any divs for adding more of something else I have and want more of or for something new. Usually something else that does a div or something growth I think will appreciate well.  That said drip works especially with the safer ETFs, but I‚Äôd rather use it to diversify into other things that may help balance and do well when others take a downturn.","I get like $3 in dividends, so no I dont.","For individual stocks it doesn't matter since only funds have CG distributions. For funds you have to turn them on or off together. It means you'll get CG distributions into your core account. You can then use those however you want (to buy more shares or not), just like dividends.","Capital gains  If you hold individual stocks you won't have any capital gains distributions , however if you invest in a fund like a mutual fund and that fund has sold stock it must distribute the capital gain to the share holders for tax reason just like dividends","I never used it because in Australia brokers don't do tax calculations for you. I figured DRIP would just complicate things by creating extra odd tax lots.  Now I'm heading into draw-down phase, I want to take the dividends as spending money anyway.","thats not how it works. Its the value of the stock that went up, not the div. value of stock only matters when you buy/sell the stock.   assuming the company did not actually change the div, you will get the same div when the stock is worth 10usd/each as 20usd/each.",I tried to turn off drip in Fidelity recently but it's confusing because it says it also turns off CG...

investing,Jun,1ddvejn,Thoughts on leveraged ETFs vs. traditional ETFs,"I've been managing my investments through a mix of ETF trading and a 401k account, but I've stayed away from leveraged ETFs so far. I've been contemplating the use of more complex instruments like 2x or 3x leveraged ETFs and am curious about others' perspectives on them.  In my opinion (and I could be wrong), these leveraged options seem to just amplify volatility. They might also involve higher commission fees and contract fees. It seems there might be ways to achieve similar benefits using normal ETFs, possibly at a lower cost. Is it the difficulty of trading or some other reasons that draw people towards leveraged ETFs? Has trading them become less challenging over time?  Would love to hear your thoughts about it.","You may want to check out r/LETFs to talk to people who regularly use leveraged funds. They can talk about hedges they employ. That could be DCA‚Äôing and taking profits, balancing it with something much less correlated like T-bills, or rotating in and out of the fund based on market conditions.  Hedging is important because if TQQQ had existed at the turn of the century, holding it through the dot-com crash would have turned $100 into [less than $1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/tkqhuy/tqqq_backtest/) and the investor wouldn‚Äôt get back to breakeven until 2019. If that person had some other money set aside they could pump back into the portfolio in 2003 and 2009, the recovery would be much faster.",The increased volatility means your stop will have to be much tighter so your max loss is contained to your set dollar loss. So you will get stopped out more often. Or you have a smaller size to control the losses in order to have a looser % stop.  Unless you don't believe in stops then I guess tighten your seat belt.,"Frankly most people can't stomach the volatility and the massive swings so it's not often recommended.  At a high level, executing on it requires extremely consistent and very frequent rebalancing.  The rebalancing aspect is key, you MUST execute this within a tax-advantaged account or the tax drag will hold you back significantly.  Be careful of the LETFS subreddit, we're in the middle of a 2 year bullrun so optimism is incredibly high, but you only have to look at some of 2021-2022 heavy inflation-era posts to see people taking 90% losses on their portfolio and getting wiped out.  You may want to read up on the person who popularized the strategy, a guy named [hedgefundie](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/) who advocated a 55/45 UPRO/TMF.  In 2021 when interest rates were rising, TMF failed as a hedge and the portfolio went down ~52% compared to the overall market dropping 14%.  It's frequently used as a cautionary tale against leveraged ETFs.","I should clarify, *The 3% Signal* is a book and not directly related to levered funds, but the basic mechanic can be useful: ¬†  * After a good quarter, take some profits and move them into Treasuries.¬† * After a not so good quarter, reinvest some of your Treasuries into stocks.","TQQQ for example has a 1.1% expense ratio, while VOO only has a 0.03% expense ratio, but that quickly can be made back from holding it long term","The problem is in a real big crash TQQQ wouldn't recover. Even if *you* got balls of steel *most people don't, they'll sell. And the fund is forced to liquidate at a massive loss*. That is what happened to *every leveraged ETF over time*.

I remember the time when APPL was almost kaput.,$0 commission fee and $0.5 per contract for options.,"They directly multiply volatility and they multiply the daily return minus the financing cost of leverage. Long term compound return is not directly multiplied by the leverage factor due to volatility drag (and financing cost) but it does increase for moderate levels of leverage.   I don't know where you're trading but in the US you can find access to leveraged ETF products without commissions or ""contract fees"". Most leveraged ETF's will have higher expense ratio, but I think you will find these cheaper than attempting to replicate their leverage in other ways except maybe futures contracts (but futures contracts require large investment amounts).   Most people can't handle the volatility of 100% allocation to 1x funds. Just look at how this sub behaves when the market goes through a mild correction. They would lose their minds if they were in a 2x or 3x fund. This is why most people don't invest in them and most people are recommended to avoid them."

These are the only funds that have lost money in my portfolio over the last few years. I thought the whole purpose of bonds was that they would only appreciate in value; so why are these down instead of up?,When rates go up the value of existing bonds goes down.,[removed],"You will recoup your losses when rates come down. If you had purchased a 7-year treasury bond at 3% 4 years ago and you needed that money today then your only option on the secondary market would be to sell it below what you paid, otherwise you'll receive what you paid plus 3% after it matures in 3 years. Similarly, if you had purchased the same amount in a bond fund that holds 7-year treasuries and sold all your shares 7 years later then you will have made back your original investment +3% on that date when factoring in yield over those 7 years.   Most people don't have the wherewithal to participate in secondary bond markets but bond funds are basically the exact same thing.",&gt; You will recoup your losses when rates come down.   They will recoup their losses even if rates never come down.,On the flip side- is there any situation where it‚Äôs better to be invested in a bond fund than directly purchasing bonds?  I‚Äôm in bond funds too and am wondering if I‚Äôll ever recoup my losses.,"Bob has a $1000 bond that pays 5%  Alice has a $1000 bond that pays 3%  Both are selling.  You are buying a $1000 bond.  Which would you pick?  The 5% one of course.  But Alice realized this too.  To make her bond more competitive she lowers the price, typically called a discount I think.  Instead of selling for $1000, she might sell for $994 or something [I don't know exactly math].   If she discounts correctly, it'll have the same return at Bobs and she can sell it in the market  place.  --  Besides Bob and Alice, the Treasury is issuing new bonds.  Say they issue new $1000 bonds at 4.5%  Alice would have to charge less for her bond since it has a lower yield.  Bob could charge slightly more since his has better yield.",Most bond funds rollover bonds to keep a constant maturity so it is not quite the same as buying an individual bond. Worth noting.,But bond funds are also buying those 4-5% bonds and the funds value will increase as a result when rates come back down. There is little to no reason to view buying a bond fund differently from buying like kind bonds.,"&gt; From my calculations, if rates go up by 1%, bond values would be down by ~9%.  This depends on the duration of the bond. Shorter-term bonds do not move as much.   &gt; Waiting 9 years, you would make it back evenly.  Technically this is wrong for bond ETFs. They do not buy a single bond and hold to maturity. Instead, they rollover bonds to have the same duration in perpetuity.","Bond funds essentially smooth out the timing of your bond purchases. If you had bought a bunch of 5 year bonds in 2020, and then in 2021 interest rates rise, you don't get the face value back until 2025, and are stuck getting low returns (so if you sell your bonds, they will sell for nowhere near face value).  If you had been in a fund composed of 5-year bonds instead, you would have presumably 1/5 of your bonds expiring in 2021 and returning the face value, allowing the fund to instantly buy  new bonds at the higher rate, so only the 1/5 of bonds that were added to the fund in 2020 are really stuck for the entire duration."

investing,Jun,1dae4hr,Looking for ideas for the best dividend stocks. What are your top picks?,I'm looking to pick all of your brains for the best of the dividend universe. I'm looking for reasonably stable dividend history - no big ups and downs and reasonably non-volatile  share price history. Just boring stocks paying above average dividends.,Google dividend aristocrats and start there.,"The strategy is questionable, but anyone obsessed with dividends should start with the S&amp;P 500 [Dividend Aristocrats](https://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/aristocrats/). Then look to the Dow Jones [US Dividend 100](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/dividends-factors/dow-jones-us-dividend-100-index/#overview). There‚Äôs overlap, but those are two good places to start.   A dividend-centric portfolio is virtually assured to underperform a total return/total market portfolio over the long term, but if all you care about is receiving dividends, that‚Äôs the list.   NOBL is the ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.   SCHD is a well-regarded ETF that tracks the Dow Jones US Dividend 100 index.   Between the two, SCHD offers both lower cost and higher yield. Hope this helps.","For starters, Siegel's methodology is problematic because it in no way resembles how investors behave in the real world. Indeed, it would have been extraordinarily difficult for an investor to have replicated Siegel's results during the time period in question because the taxable account was the primary investment vehicle at the time, and capital gains tax would have slaughtered the investor's portfolio after rebalancing each year to replace the existing portfolio with the new set of Siegel's top quintile of dividend payers. If you know of *anyone* who has actually implemented this strategy and is willing to share their portfolio returns with us, by all means I welcome that data. If you yourself are following Siegel's methodology in that quote, and selling off huge blocks of shares each year to replace companies that fell from the top 20% with the new companies that entered it, then I welcome you sharing your results so we can benchmark them against the indices.  The second very real problem with chasing dividend stocks is choosing which ones. You can pick and choose stocks from the Dividend Aristocrats or Dow lists I linked above. Before you do, go take a look at the list of companies that fell from those lists due to cutting the dividend or, worse, going bankrupt. That list is *much longer* than the current list of companies. Survivorship bias, where one looks only at the companies that survived and ignores the ones that resulted in capital destruction for the shareholder is a common error. You can say ""well I'll just hold companies like PG and JNJ because surely they'll never go under"" but for decades investors said the same thing about GE and Kodak.   You can avoid the inherent risks in stock picking by buying an index that does the selection for you. But dividend ETFs like SCHD and NOBL have underperformed the broader S&amp;P 500 index since their inception. It turns out that rejecting the half of the index that doesn't pay dividends -- the Alphabets, Metas, etc. of the market -- carries material opportunity cost. The better solution is to buy and hold the entire market and invest for total return.",Another place to get ideas would be to look up some high dividend yield ETFs and look up the stocks that make up the composition of the ones held by the etf,I'm in my mid 70's and looking for income rather than growth at this point?,Cheat code in life - buy MO stock‚Ä¶but never their productsüòÇ,"Consumer staples my friend.

They're simple, no-brainers.",MO,"&gt; A dividend-centric portfolio is very likely to underperform a total return/total market portfolio over the long term,   people keep making this claim on reddit, but the evidence doesn't support it.   for one example, to quote *The Future for Investors* (2005) by professor Jeremy Siegel of Wharton:   &gt;I examined the record of firms in the S&amp;P 500 Index from its beginning in 1957 to the present. On December 31 of each year I sorted the firms in the S&amp;P 500 Index into five groups (or quintiles) ranked by dividend yield, and then calculated the return over the next calendar year. The first group comprises those firms in the lowest 20 percent of the dividend yields (many paid no dividends, especially in more recent years). The second group comprises the next 20 percent ranked by dividend yield, and so on up to the fifth group, which includes firms with the highest yield. I then calculated the return on each of these portfolios over the next year before I re-sorted the firms again, based on the same criteria.  &gt;...**In strictly increasing order, the portfolios with higher dividend yields offered investors higher returns. If an investor started with $1,000 at the end of December of 1957, she would have accumulated $130,768 in an S&amp;P 500 Index fund by the end of 2003, for an annual return of 11.19 percent. If instead she purchased only the highest 20 percent of dividend yielders in each year she would have accumulated $462,750, more than three times the indexed accumulation. Although the risk of these high yielders was slightly higher than that of the S&amp;P 500, its annual return of 14.27 percent was more than worth the extra risk. If instead, she bought the lowest-dividend-yielding stocks, she would have accumulated only about one-half the sum placed in an indexed fund‚Äîa return under 10 percent a year. Even worse for investors, the risk of the lowest-yielding group containing many no-dividend stocks was also the highest of all the portfolios.**  this research, covering almost half a century of US market returns, completely contradicts everything reddit believes about dividends from those extraordinarily misleading Ben Felix videos.   but Siegel's not the only source of this data, and research from numerous sources indicates dividend-paying stocks tend to outperform globally over the long-term under a variety of tax regimes.",This article proves that point.

investing,Jun,1dixngz,Getting on the AI bandwagon,"Hello Everyone, I am already invested in the SP500 through Vanguard (of which AI giants like Nvidia and Google form a major part). I am wondering if it makes sense to buy individual GOOG and NVDA stocks at this point in time (when valuations and prices are high). Alternately, I am also thinking about buying more affordable but promising AI companies (I wouldn't know which) using the philosophy that a rising tide lifts all boats. Or maybe an AI-based sector ETF?      I have never invested in individual stocks before (other than what was granted to me through RSUs) and am not even sure if a play like this makes sense.  Is what I am contemplating prudent? Any feedback (critical or otherwise) is welcome.","FOMO is not a reason to invest. Beware the AI bubble, and chasing market leaders in general. Don't ""get on a bandwagon"". If you're going to stock pick, and not just do index funds, you better have a good thesis behind your picks. A company saying ""AI"" 50 times at a conference call doesn't count.",maybe some companies that are at the very start of the ‚ÄûAi supply chain‚Äú and are not included in your ETF would be good choice. some examples:  ASML- produces incredibly expensive and intricate machines that produce chips  TSMC- manufacturer of Nvidia chips  Broadcom- produces chips and general AI infrastructure   S√ºss MicroTec- produces parts for ASML  Jenoptik- also a part manufacturer   AMD- mainly cpus and could potentially become more of a rival to Nvidia in the next few years/ months  Micron Technology- manufacturers RAM and other storage parts  SuperMicroComputer - server infrastructure   Dell- also server infrastructure and a lot of other hardware,"I don't hate AI, but damn if this doesn't look like a bubble.   I Have a software developer friend that works at Salesforce, he said they just slapped gpt on the end of every product they make and marketing pumps out a bunch of stuff about AI but they don't have a single AI product that actually functions.   He was in a large developer meeting with department heads and the question was asked ""if a customer asked us right now for an AI solution, what product or feature could we sell them?"" There was only a single answer, so they brought up the product in question and attempted to use it...and the query returned as a null field.   I'm certainly not saying all companies are doing this, but it might be hard to sift through all of the garbage when it comes to AI hype.","Whether ppl want to admit it or not, AI is running the market. If you mention Ai (or worse, don‚Äôt) you stock is going to reflect it. Just look at Apples massive bounce based almost solely on AI hints and suggestions.

In an efficient, rational market, stock prices are based on only the expected returns.   Unless you know something everyone else doesn't, buying an individual stock is a bet on ""unexpected returns"".  Most people are already anticipating AI to shape the future, and for the industry leaders to profit fantastically. Those expectations are baked into current variations and projected earnings. Those companies need to somehow EXCEED those lofty expectations of dominance to beat the market.","The AI revolution is just getting off the ground and should continue to grow for years to come. Sure there will be corrections along the way, but there's a lot of runway left for growth. If your investment horizon is long enough to recover from drawdowns (at which point you buy more shares), it absolutely makes sense to supplement your index fund with individual stocks.

investing,Jun,1dh9hkk,2024 gains have mostly been allocated to Tech/AI,"Looking at SP500 constitute stocks, majority of the gains have been driven by a few tech names with many stocks/industries being flat   I suppose the question is, at what point do we concede that a market approach underperforms vs a tech ETF?

I guess my question is (and I suppose the answer is no one knows), which statement would you agree with more:  1) is this dynamic statistically significant and tech large caps just command such buying power that they can continuously innovate and outperform.   2) other SPY names might be undervalued presenting an opportunity   Thanks !","&gt;I suppose the question is, at what point do we concede that a market approach underperforms vs a tech ETF?  a whole market approach will always underperform compared to &lt;picking the winners in hindsight&gt; just like a specific broad ETF will always underperform the handful of individual winners. you diversify because you (well, on average any person) will not be able to successfully pick the winners long term.     if the argument is tech companies will always grow more rapidly 'long term' the result is tech companies being valued far more aggressively. which we are already seeing - tons of startups with a lot of momentum get really extreme valuations which can collapse pretty rapidly if they start to lose that momentum.","I think an important point is an S&amp;P 500 fund is not as broad of a market fund as people think if a large part of the gains come from six stocks.

Yes your house value has gone up, but so has basically every other house in America. Your gains are null because a comparable house for you to move into would have likely gone up ~100k as well, with probably a higher interest rate, meaning your monthly payment will significantly increase. Plus if you switch to renting, you're basically throwing away that money rather than putting it towards an asset in your name.  My advice is unless you need to sell for some other reason, such as having children and needing more space, or moving closer to your new job, just stay in your current situation. At a $60k salary you could aggressively pay off your debt in a year.

I'd go ahead and max out the 401k all the way instead of just going up to the match since you're already going to be maxing a Roth IRA for the year and have all this savings. If you have an HDHP for health insurance, I'd also go ahead and max your HSA for the year and get that money invested instead of spending from the HSA.

If you place an order to ""buy 3.1 shares"" you'll only actually buy three and the cash value of 0.1 will be assigned to you from either the market makers inventory or some fractional sale at a different time.

My dude, you are trying way too hard.   &gt;Eliminating the order type won't change the structure of the market in any way.  Your above comment was complaining about the lack of fractional share execution in markets, this one is just rambling about the existence of market orders?    &gt;With prices changing in fractions of a second these days it leaves a lot of room that will almost never favor the investor.  Can you explain to me why you believe tighter spreads make market orders unfavorable?   Also, can you explain why you've changed the subject from being upset about fractional shares to being upset about market orders?","Look man, the whole tryhard insult thing isn't credentializing you.    &gt; Talking about market orders in a discussion regarding forcing the transaction of fractional shares as market orders is changing the subject?  Yes, these are different subjects.  Markets do not accept fractional shares.  They're not necessarily executed as market orders because that's how they need to be done, it's because that's the easiest way for a broker to trade their house account.    Again, I don't really know what your gripe is, can you articulate the specifics here?  Is it spreads as you alluded to earlier when talking about volume as if it's a bad thing?  Is it order structures, why?  is it that fractional shares are traded at the broker level?    This time, can you do it without all the forced ""kid"" stuff?  It's not having the impact you think it is.","&gt; the cash value of 0.1 will be assigned to you from either the market makers inventory or some fractional sale at a different time.  The broker themselves houses the aggregate of the fractional shares in their house account.  So let's say everyone's fractional shares of AAPL add up to 1234.56 shares, the broker will usually just hold either 1234 or 1235 shares in the house account and assign the values to everyone.  They usually just buy/sell what they need to true up during the closing activity of a given day.    This is why the execution on your fractional shares will generally be very close to the closing value.","If you can‚Äôt be bothered to post an answer and instead send folks to a specific spot, it means you‚Äôre trying to sell what‚Äôs in that spot."
investing,Jun,1dkkjd3,Senator Warren Accuses Powell Of 'Bowing To Banking Industry Pressure',"Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren has accused Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of yielding to the influence of financial industry pressures, considering revisions to regulations intended to increase the capital buffers that large U.S. banks must hold.  I am disappointed by press reports indicating that you are personally intervening‚ÄÇ- after numerous meetings with big bank CEOs‚ÄÇ- to delay and water down the Basel III capital rules, Warren wrote.  Last year, three U.S. banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, released proposed rules that were long-awaited shifts in mechanisms related to bank capital and high-risk activities such as trading and lending. These rules incorporated new international standards developed in response to the 2008 global financial crisis.  These rules are critical and long overdue, particularly in the wake of the Silicon Valley and Signature Bank failures, and as risks from the weak commercial real estate market and other economic threats ripple through the banking system,‚ÄÇWarren stated.  Previously, bank CEOs and their lobbying groups have argued that the increases in capital requirements are excessively large and will force the banking sector to cut back on lending.‚ÄÇThen in March, Powell told lawmakers that following the financial sector's campaign against these rules, he expects broad and material changes to the proposal.  It now appears that you are directly doing the bank industry's bidding, rewarding them for their extensive personal lobbying of you,‚ÄÇWarren wrote in her letter. Taking orders from the industry that caused the 2008 economic meltdown would sacrifice the financial security of middle-class and working families to line the pockets of wealthy investors and CEOs.  She further criticized Powell, arguing that regulatory rollbacks during his tenure as Fed Chair have led to the 2023 regional banking crisis, and have made Jamie Dimon and his Wall Street cronies richer.  Warren urged Powell to allow the Federal Reserve to vote on the original, stricter Basel proposal by the end of this month. The window to finalize and approve these rules before the November U.S. election is closing and analysts say the proposal may be delayed or scrapped if Trump is re-elected.  When asked to respond to Warren's letter, a Fed spokesperson issued the following statement on Tuesday morning: We have received the letter and plan to respond.",Hard to take anything Elizabeth Warren says seriously,"A few years ago she was going pretty hard against crypto, but then her tune changed right around the time that Black Rock and other big firms started promoting their Bitcoin ETFs.",That's what happens when you go against big money ;),That must've been as recently as this week because I'm not seeing the pivot at all.    https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/at-hearing-warren-calls-for-applying-strong-anti-money-laundering-protections-to-cryptocurrency-to-shut-down-financing-for-us-adversaries-and-terrorist-groups    https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/17/crypto-congress-democrats-00158630,Ah yes you're definitely going against big money by crying about rising interest rates,"Your post has been removed because it's a low effort post.

investing,Jun,1dpruix,Am I crazy to keep putting money into a bond ETF?,"I'm 9 years from retirement so I started buying into a bond ETF along with my usual investments to add stability to my portfolio, VGIT is the ticker symbol.   This was 12 months ago and I'm up 0.48%, I find myself thinking I'd be better off putting that money in my cash position, SPAXX.   I'm not expecting big growth from a bond ETF but it hurts seeing it underperform a money market account.   Any thoughts or insights would be appreciated.","Depends on where it's at. If it's in a tax deferred or tax free account and you want to track those things, go for it.    If it's a taxable account and you want to keep a close eye on it, you'll get tax friction from switching.   If you just want to ""fire-and-forget"", leave it in the bond fund. Over 10 years, it'll likely even out and you'll be better off in the long run.  Remember you aren't investing for the past 12 months. You're investing for the rest of your life.","Look, if you bought this exactly 12 months ago, you would have bought it at $59. Now it's at $58.62, so you're about even.  However, you did $2.2 in dividends.  So your TR = 0% + 2.2 / 59 = 3.8%, which is VGLT's dividend yield TTM.  At that level, it's not bad.  I bought it at $63 and still holding on.  With the first interest rate cut, I expect VGLT to rise above $65 and then some.  The capital appreciation will come with the Fed rate around 3.0% and expectations of continuing cuts in the Street. By that time, we would have vanquished inflation.  Some people think that's a big if but when you have anything other than a soft landing, it will happen.","I should have mentioned this was in a taxable brokerage account, thanks.",The inmates are running the asylum.,"Only holding 10-20% stocks is a bad idea. The Trinity study (which is where we get the 4% safe withdrawal rate rule from) found that 25-50% bonds was optimal, with 75-100% bonds significantly increasing your chance of failure.",Brilliant!,Age is irrelevant without an assumption of when one retires.  Just use time from retirement directly.,"Oh, sorry!  These tickers are so alike it's damn so confusing.  Ok, hold on, let me look at VGIT!  Wow, their prices even look identical. So it's still $59 entry price.  TTM dividend yield is 3.1% so you didn't collect as much.  But your TR is around 3.1%.  But your yields are higher now at around 4.4%.  And VGIT will pop when the Fed starts cutting.  It will not pop as much as VGLT, however, as the shorter duration makes it less sensitive the lower interest rate as VGLT.  Nonetheless, it could be up to \~$65-$67 if the FFR approaches 2.5-3.0%.  Hope for a hard landing.","From here on out yields should go down and you'll be doing better. Problem was you bought a fund that maintains its ""duration"" (bond terminology) at about 5 years and you held it while yields increased.  Rule of thumb: You can estimate the future price of a bond fund by multiplying its duration by the expected change in yield. Since last year yields for the bonds that VGIT mostly holds went up roughly 1.00%. So that means you've had a loss in the price of VGIT of about 1.00% x 5 year duration = -5.00%. The dividend probably made up most of that loss, but still, the overall position is probably a bit negative.  With hindsight, the best place to be in bonds this past year was in maturities of 3 years or less. Their yields since last year are mostly unchanged.   You made a good choice with VGIT should stocks tank. Treasurys are the only bond type that we can trust will rally when stocks fall bigtime.","I think you are correct on all points. However, I find it difficult to see the Fed cutting rates in any robust way anytime soon. I feel we will be lucky to see a quarter point cut this year."
investing,Jun,1dp060f,I'm new to this and want to invest with my HSA ,"I am brand new into investing (yes I will read the wiki on the side bar after posting this), but I wanted to hear some opinions and maybe advice for the position I am in. I have an HSA through Fidelity and learned that I am able to invest whatever goes into my HSA into the stock market. This is something that I would like to do, as I haven't touched much of the money in my HSA in a couple of years, so it feels like it's just kind of sitting there. I know it is there in case of an emergency but I would like to invest so of it to try and make some more money. Does anyone have any tips, suggestions advice for someone in my position?  One specific question I have is about the taxes/penalties that I might accrue by selling/trading stocks.  Is there a way to take out money tax-free from the money you make from investing?  Are there penalties for taking money out of an investment too early or before a certain period of time?  If this belongs in a different sub I apologize again I am new here and have no idea what I'm doing, but trying to learn.","Read up on how an HSA works (what are the pros and cons) and it will answer all of your questions. And yes, you should invest your HSA money, and preferably in a low cost index fund.","&gt; Does anyone have any tips, suggestions advice for someone in my position?  Index fund -- Fidelity has options if you want mutual fund form, or there's always the Vanguard ETFs (VOO, VTI, VUG, VTV, etc.)  &gt; One specific question I have is about the taxes/penalties that I might accrue by selling/trading stocks.  HSAs are generally exempt from taxes while the money stays in the account.   &gt; Is there a way to take out money tax-free from the money you make from investing?  By spending it on covered healthcare expenses.  That's the only way to take money out of an HSA without tax implications.  You can keep the account for life though and pay for medicare using HSA funds.  Taking money out of an HSA for reasons other than healthcare before age 65, will get you a sizable penalty (20%?) on top of income tax.  After age 65, you can take money out for reasons other than healthcare and just owe income tax (so similar to a 401k but with a later age -- 65 instead of 59.5)  &gt; Are there penalties for taking money out of an investment too early or before a certain period of time?  No.  There may be penalties for taking money out of the *account*, but not for taking it out of a particular investment inside the account.  I mean, you could do really stupid things like pull money in and out of a mutual fund with load, and you'd be penalized for that in terms of your balance, but it's not really a ""penalty"".","Investopedia keeps a good primer on the subject - [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp)   On your tax question, as long as you pull the money for 'qualified medical expenses' (go learn what this means), then you should not have a tax burden associated with that distribution out of the HSA account. Any money that stays in the HSA and grows should also be shielded from tax. Generally speaking, time is on your side, so the less you use it, the more time it has to grow, so I tend to think the logic is to keep an amount equal to your deductible in cash as a backstop against an emergency situation, and then invest the rest.","&gt;One specific question I have is about the taxes/penalties that I might accrue by selling/trading stocks.  &gt;Is there a way to take out money tax-free from the money you make from investing?  The great thing about an HSA is that as long as you spend the money on approved healthcare-related costs, you will not pay taxes on any money you make.  &gt; Are there penalties for taking money out of an investment too early or before a certain period of time?  Nope, not if you spend the money on health care (including your dentist or copay at your PCP or at the ER or anything like that).  &gt; Does anyone have any tips, suggestions advice for someone in my position?  Once you log into your HSA portal, you should have a list of funds you can invest in. For example, 100% of my HSA in invested in VIGIX (Vanguard's high growth fund), but there should also be a low-fee S&amp;P 500-based index fund in there, such as Fidelity's FXIAX. I would recommend investing almost all your HSA in that, while keeping ~$200-500 in cash that you can use at a doctor's appointment.","Honestly you should learn by watching starter YouTube videos to understand basic concepts before coming here.

No, unless you have a really creative lawyer to justify that its medically necessary.  &gt;Are there penalties for taking money out of an investment too early or before a certain period of time?  Only penalty is if you withdraw the funds for a non-medical purpose. It's a 20% penalty + taxes.  If you are at least 65 years old, you can withdraw for non-medical purposes without a penalty, but there's still taxes.  &gt;I know it is there in case of an emergency but I would like to invest so of it to try and make some more money. Does anyone have any tips, suggestions advice for someone in my position?  So consider that stocks have risks- so if you might need to pull the money out for a hospital bill, expensive test, etc, that could be risky if your investments are down 70% at the same time you have a bill you need to pay.  Personally I invest my HSA in safe investments like VUSB. I get about 5.5-6% annual returns with very little risk. Yes, I'd probably make more in the long term with stocks. But I don't see the point. If I end up with a $5 Million HSA because I made huge gains in the stock market, what am I going to do with it?  So I keep the stocks for my Retirement accounts.","Because it is both diversified and low cost, so you will have the best chances of making high returns over the long run.",Will do on the reading up.

There are a lot of good options that provide from 4%-5%+ right now. Transferring to and from is very easy through an app, and takes a couple business days, as long as Venmo does.

investing,Jun,1dgbvl8,Are there actually any good financial advisers? Wondering about what my FA said. ,"I have been on the fence about ditching my FA and just doing it DIY with the Bogleheads approach for about a year now. Made lots of posts about it too.  However, I have been looking over the returns that my FA has generated. In lean years it's about 6% PA and good years 11.5%. Those are not bad numbers considering they factor in the cost of the FA, expense ratios and switches.  I have discussed my Bogleheads strategy with my FA and he says it's a good one. I've even more or less said that if I can do I'll just leave - he probably has tons of other clients so he doesn't really need me.  Most of the books I have read make out FAs to be some horrible spawn of evil that are taking you for a ride. I guess that is true for completely uneducated investors (I used to be one) Or maybe it's more true in the USA market - I am Singaporean and the market here is very strictly controlled.  Most recently he said that he could combine the buy and hold Bogleheads strategy with sentiment-based investing to generate 11-12% PA - having the FA on hand helps take advantage of things like Nvdia (which I wouldn't normally be aware of) This seems a little too good to be true?  I welcome advise and opinions.","My God the blind hate on financial advisors here.  People.  There are more complicated situations that exist than just needing 50 or 500k managed.  Independent, fiduciary FA's can be absolute game changers when complicated situations come up.    True story: both my in-laws died, 3 months apart.  They had been separated but not divorced, or 20 years.  One had IRA plus pension.  One had pension plus 401k.  Plus a house sale.  Clusterfuck doesn't even start to describe it.  Neither had done any real estate planning.  FA was worth every penny we paid her to help us sort through all that bullshit until we had our feet back under us.  We paid probably 5k total in hourly fees to her.  She saved us WAY more than that in taxes alone, let alone giving some piece of mind about my strategy for investing the money we were receiving.","I like my FA. I procured him after my first husband died, and he helped me not have to think too much. He was a neighbor, so that helped. Fast forward 15 years, and my average gains have been 9-14% per year. I pay him 1%. Could I make the same on my own? Maybe. So I want the stress? No.    It's an individual decision.","The amount of money you have matters little other than making fee based advisors better. As you said, you can have your finances complicated to the point where you need to hire people to run them. Or they are simple. You could have $10 million and no need for a financial advisor, or you could be in debt with a negative net worth and need one.  What the vast majority of people generally don't need is an investment advisor. A financial advisor is more for personal finance issues like the ones mentioned, but as it relates to investing, no advisor is going to consistent outperform investment fund managers who themselves have trouble just outperforming the market.",Why would you benchmark a Singaporeans portfolio held in Singaporean dollars to the S&amp;P 500?,"A CFP is worthwhile, especially with situations like you said, or people trying to figure out things closer to retirement. But going to a Schwab or Edward jones retail location is a waste of money at the age of 29","It averages 8-9% because in bad years it can get to the - % numbers. Really bad years can be - 20% (think the 2008 market crash). 8-9% average doesn't mean ""it usually returns that much"". It means when you balance out the very good years (20-30% up), very bad years (10-20% down) and the average years, it's about 9%.","I say you probably don't need him but just curious, could you compare the FA's performance with the SP500?","Just from this info you gave, he sounds like a decent FA. What are his fees though?  Yeah the boglehead approach is my favorite for investing. The buy and hold of a vastly diversified portfolio between stocks/bonds/cash broad market indexes is the strategy that beats almost everything else in the long run. It's the perfect mix of high returns and simplicity.  There are good FA's out there, but there are TONS of bad ones who charge way too much in fees and invest people's money in unnecessary active managed crap. During the accumulation phase, you probably don't need ANYONE to manage your money because your strategy is simple: no matter what happens, just keep buying consistently. The nuances of tax planning and getting the most ROI from your portfolio comes near retirement. And if you don't feel like educating yourself on the best strategies for your particular retirement situation, that's where good FA's can shine for you.","I work with FA‚Äôs and help them transition their books. I‚Äôve worked with very few who just wanna snake their clients money, but I‚Äôve mainly worked with good ones. From what I‚Äôve seen, on top of investing, lots of FA‚Äôs tend to offer things like tax harvesting, managing trust funds, setting up your estate, a lot of them will play that unbiased median amongst you and your problematic relatives about the money if they manage it for you, helping your family manage inheritances, protecting your assets against things that can dent you financially such as a divorce. They typically work with people who are neck deep into retirement or people who are too busy and have too much to manage on their own, especially with taxes. The best part of having an FA around though I‚Äôd say is the very vast wide network that they have. They have direct lines and close relationships with other people who are very wealthy and have great connections, and your FA‚Äôs are typically always willing to facilitate that connection for you.   Would I ever have an FA? No. I probably won‚Äôt ever get that rich and I just dump it all into VOO anyways. But I do see the value. Just depends on what you‚Äôre willing to spend vs what you‚Äôre looking for and what suits you right now.","&gt;¬†In lean years it's about 6% PA and good years 11.5%  Have you been invested with them for all this time? That is, they managed to avoid which market drawdowns specifically?  If these are backtests or past performance I would be leery. Backtests for obvious reasons but even if it‚Äôs real past performance it could simply be that there were 100 FAs ten years ago at this institution, and by pure chance the ones who managed to be lucky several years in a row stuck around while the unlucky ones don‚Äôt share their past returns or start a new fund  11.5% is also low for GOOD years as a good year in the S&amp;P500 is 20-30% (of course with bigger drawdowns"

I'd like a relatively good US% , but sceptical about making it a very high proportion or sole investment just in case a drop similar to early '00s happens again.

The more diverse you go the less risk and less return.   S&amp;P is diverse and safe with a proven record. Can it lose? Sure. Can other things out perform it? Sure.   I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable setting and forgetting anything for 20 years. You can always rebalance or change courses.

Dropping companies that have lower performance and adding companies that grow.,"This is correct. The S&amp;P 500 is self-cleansing, so putting money into VOO and forgetting about it for 20 years is actually an optimal strategy.

It is an index that HAS delivered very strong returns. Whether it continues to do so is another matter. I'd rather have a globally diversified portfolio.  &gt;¬†aiming to start adding bonds later when I approach 55-60.  This thinking is flawed for many reasons. You should always be evaluating your investment opportunities based on the pricing available at the time you make the investment decisions. I see many rules of thumb and investment advice about adding fixed income to portfolios given a certain age for the investor. But the price matters so much. In 2020-2021 you would have been buying bonds at the worst yields in history and suffered massive losses as a result. And many investors were even buying negative-yielding debt. Just be aware of what you are actually buying and whether or not it fits with your investment plan, rather than simply buying something because of your age irrespective of the price.","Assuming tax advantaged account throughout this comment.   For a pension no brainer some international is better.   One of the main risks you face is inflation risk.  Your draw increases as interest rates increase driving down both stocks and bonds.  You portfolio gets severely damaged quickly by sequencing risk.  That's what happened to investors in the later 1960s, which is worse in terms of sustainable draw percentage for retirement than 1929-1933 assuming you are holding bonds.  People holding international in the late 1960s do fine because the dollar fell sharply and international was in a bull.   Even a small international holding raised the safe draw rate considerably.   Now of course that's when you are drawing.  You are 20 years from drawing. IMHO international will outperform domestic due to valuation and the dollar's fundamentals. Demographics are a wildcard since the USA is generally pro immigration but currently has been tightening since Clinton.   I think the SP500 is in 2024 too narrow in terms of sectors.  It has always been to growthy and large for my tastes.  All of which point to global.    Also there are terrific active global funds which have long track records of positive alpha.  Which makes it a very easy set it and forget it. Dodge and Cox, Vanguard Global, TRowe Global.  I'm a bit hesitant about Harris and Associates succession plans but Oakmark Global (use advisor shares or institutional shares at $100k, $1m respectively) was a favorite until recently.

investing,Jun,1dowgwl,Buying our first Multi-Family. Should we do 5% down or 20% by liquidating investments? ,"[This is the situation:  We have the opportunity to purchase a 4-unit building for $750,000. We can do a 5% down payment in cash, which is the original plan. However, we also have $30,000 in bonds (not counting the interest since they are less than five years old) and about 33,000 in mutual funds (we would have to pay 15% tax on gains from about 15,000), and my parents are willing to gift us $47,000 as a wedding gift. This would total $150,000, a 20% down payment to not have to pay BMI about (~350/month), and giving us a small positive operating expense ratio after calculating rents income, and insurance and bills expenses. At the 5% we'd have to pay ~$1,000/$1,200 out of pocket to met the mortgage and expenses total.   (None of these are our emergency fund, $20,000, we're not touching that.)  Currently the investments are netting us about $600 a month, but the vanguard funds have been a rollercoaster for the last year. By liquidating investments, our mortgage would drop by about $1,000 monthly.  Also, probably worth mentioning, I have about a ~$4,000 a month surplus in income from my job so I have wiggle room.  So the question is: would it be a good idea to liquidate all those investments to reach the 20% down, or should we leave those alone and do the 5% only? What do you all think?",Have you already spoken with lenders?

And historical rate average is 5.42%. While it is a lot higher than the last dozen years or so it seems like we are reverting to a mean.  What argument is there that a lower rate would not be inflationary?,The entire 2010 decade,Productivity growth and globalization   The 2010s had low rates and monetary expansion but inflation was low because of the rise of Chinese manufacturing and outsourcing,"The question you're asking has also been asked by a lot of central banks and international financial institutions, which frame the issue in terms of the neutral or non-inflationary rate of interest, a.k.a. ""r-star"". The short answer is nobody knows.  The linked paper from the Bank of International Settlements is a pretty good non-technical summary; it concludes ""assessments of the level and direction of r\* are surrounded by very high uncertainty, making it a blurry guidepost for monetary policy, especially in the current context."" The Fed also has a ton of research on the subject if you want to get into the weeds.  [https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r\_qt2403b.pdf](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2403b.pdf)","In isolation, an interest rate cut would always be inflationary. When we relax the *ceteris paribus* assumption, interest rate cuts would not be inflationary if...  1. Asset prices are collapsing as a result of a recession/depression, in which case the interest rate cut by itself is still inflationary, but is acting like a brake to the decline in the markets, with a net effect of ""less deflation"" as opposed to inflation or depression. 2. Despite the additional money supply, the output of goods and services outpaces it. In this case, inflation is present and market stresses are few, but the increase in general output level is faster than the increase in the money supply, leading to net deflation. 3. Increased technology, intense rivalry/competition, and/or significant cost cutting results in prices coming down despite any rate cuts. This is basically the 2010s (less the eventual 2020 recession), where a combination of technological advances, stiff competition between major companies, and offshoring/globalization all ended up bringing the U.S. ***below*** target inflation for several years running.",Stagnant or negative population growth,Example Japan zero rate policy,[deleted],rates were zero for a decade with no inflation?,"Recent inflation was the result of massive US government payment programs that were created to combat Covid from crashing the ecomony.  There were multiple billions of $ that were deposited directly into taxpayers bank accounts.  The average consumer spent the money which screwed up supply &amp; demand because of how big of a chunk of money it was.  Inflation was transitory, but it took more than a few weeks or months to get back to normal after such a huge disruption.","It‚Äôs the ‚Äúnatural rate of interest‚Äù, ie where interest rates would fall in a perfect market with no transaction costs, no liquidity concerns, etc.    It‚Äôs a theoretical construct to use as a benchmark for tight vs loose monetary policy.  For instance the fed having their short rate at 2% in 2016 would have been incredibly tight because the natural rate of interest was lower than that, but in 2022 it would have been too loose.

She wants to put 80k into a hysa account to supplement her SSDI money.  She wants to invest the additional 200k into a S&amp;P fund. Where would she put this with no earned w2 income? A brokerage? A trad IRA?   How does she protect the 200k from potential tax liability on the growth?,HYSA is an option but why not put it into a brokerage account with one like Fidelity and leave it in the default money market fund they provide?

She can contribute to an HSA if she has a high deductible plan.  Would declaring the $500/month as self-employed income impact her SSDI benefits? Any dividend or interest income she would make off that $280k will count as income.,"No, dividends cannot count as earned income so.

investing,Jun,1d8tzac,Musk/Tesla Insider trading question,"\*\*I am not promoting Tesla in any way. Reddit wouldn't give me any other flair options besides NSFW. Sorry.   Thanks to anyone who replies. I saw that Musk is apparently under fire for offloading $7.5B of stock (I think in 2022) during a time when he knew that the company wouldn't meet its targets. He also assured investors that it would be a great end to the year, despite knowing the opposite and selling stock.   I'm somewhat ignorant of the legal specifics, and I'm more curious about that than the actual Musk situation. I know insider trading is illegal, but if you're a CEO or other exec and you know your stock is about to take a hit, are you legally required to maintain your position and take the same proportional losses as any other investor?   Also, to avoid getting caught, why don't CEOs allow themselves to take very minor losses and then sell? I'm not advocating that, I'm just genuinely curious. It seems like a sketchy choice to sell so much stock without incurring losses when losses are incurred by others so shortly after. If a CEO rides a loss for just a little bit and **then** sells before everyone else (who lacks the CEO's insider knowledge) is that still insider trading?",It's done using what is called a 10b5-1 plan.

Either as a shareholder who got screwed by not being able to sell before bad news happened, or as someone who got screwed by buying in because an insider indicated that the company was performing well -- and that turned out to be a lie?  That's why these things are regulated and there are laws against them.  If I put out a press release and said ""Tesla to acquire PsychYYZ LLC"" and then I sold all my stock knowing the press release was a total fabrication...  As a buyer you'd be pissed because it's an outright fraud.  Just because #SpaceKaren is worth billions, doesn't mean that he should be able to get away with this shit.",I could be mistaken but iirc he was selling shares of tesla as his last resort to making enough cash available for his acquisition of Twitter.

On a scale of 1 (Rather Questionable) to 10 (Outright Securities Fraud), where would you place the situation with Musk and why?",Learning the pre scheduled sales can be cancelled means they are worthless as indicators of insider selling,"I believe OP is asking with regards to the more recent issue where it is accused that Musk was selling shares based on current financials looking bad, but he was screaming at the top of his lungs that everything was amazing and doing great.     Since he had non-public information and was acting on it, while actively making public contrary information, it's a bad look for him.    If he had been on a 10b5-1 plan and it's all just a coincidence it should clear up quickly, but comments I've heard suggest that the pattern of sales are not immediately looking like it's a coincidence.",Execs don't usually have a need for insider buying considering their compensation tends to be mostly in equity award.

Assuming all of my tax lots for Apple are being sold for profit, is there any issue with this?

Around 2013-2016 they seemed to really lift off, beyond normal inflation rates. WM and RSG both currently around 34 P/E which seems a little extreme.  Maybe not a big deal but even the president of WM sold $7.4mil worth of shares recently.  Are WM and RSG still considered good long term investments at these levels?","I think it depends   I think it's a STABLE investment.  If you want something with less volatility and a decent dividend.

investing,Jun,1dpl44c,"Are actively managed funds worth it? Or should I not bother? Some have high returns with lower risk, at 0.9% fee. ","I know most people say go with index funds, but I can see that there are some active ""funds of funds"" containing a variety of ETFs that cover geographical areas with a great balance that usually you don't see in indices. Eg a global equity index will usually be US-heavy (60-70%) while in a global active fund you can have 20pc US, 20pc Europe, 20pc EM.  Another factor in favor of holding SOME active funds in the list: some of them have an index as a benchmark but are more balanced or differ in a way that gives them lower beta/risk. Take for example L&amp;G Global Tech, one of the best indices in technology, It's 85pc US based (so not that global after all), while the corresponding Global Tech from Fidelity is actively managed, more balanced (50pc US) resulting in much lower drops but keeps very high rates.

You can just do that yourself with passive funds and not charge yourself nearly a percent for doing it...  The argument for actively managed would normally be that they can do things you can't do -- like you're buying expertise or access.  At least for me, I think the highest expense ratio I own is TMFC (0.5%).  And that wasn't like ""throw my retirement at it"", it was like ""throw a few thousand bucks at it and see what happens"".  FWIW, what has happened is it's beating VOO by a few percent a year.  So that's neat :-)  Also, global tech being 85% US feels... not that heavy to me.  The US is a global leader in tech and it's the largest economy in the world.  And tech companies are probably disproportionately inclined to list on US exchanges regardless of where they are.  Also funds tend to throw around so much money that it's hard to put a sizable chunk into anything but giant corporations which are also disproportionately in the US.

Also as those funds grow, earning the same return becomes more difficult, which is why many well performing funds limit who can invest and how much they will manage.","There‚Äôs no such thing as higher return with lower risk.

Please convince me that I should not change it up to 100% in this ETF. My reasoning for going 50/50 was that the ETF was so pricy already that it seemed like it may underperform; but it looks like interest rates are going to go lower some time, so it seems like if anything, the ETF may outperform when that happens.

If you are going to need the money in the near term (3-5 years), it's advised to avoid anything that would have exposure to a market crash (Stocks / ETF's). CD's are a good bet in this situation.

investing,Jun,1do86lr,USA vs Irish investing query,"Hello,  I'm fairly new to the world of investing and have a specific question that I couldn't find an answer to.   Me (Irish) and my spouse (American) are living in Ireland and looking to start investing. We are wondering whether it is possible to invest through the American system using my spouse's social rather than the Irish system (mainly due to the deemed disposal rule in Ireland where we have to pay 41% tax on all unsold ETFs every 8 years). Or would this not be possible due to us not living in the US?  Seems that the USA is set up much better for individual investors than Ireland is.  Thank you!","No you cannot do this. You are resident in Ireland and thus subject to taxation on your worldwide income/assets. You absolutely can invest in ETFs in the US, but you will have to pay the 41% tax on ETF profits including the deemed disposals every 8 years. You are also subject to 33% capital gains tax on individual stocks.  Source: I'm Irish.  You should also join us over on /r/irishpersonalfinance",What is the rational for punishing eft investments over individual stocks? That just seems so strange.,"I can't offer any advice on investment through your spouse's account, however:  &gt; Seems that the USA is set up much better for individual investors than Ireland is  That's a problem that's been [highlighted before (and recently - see the end of the penultimate paragraph)](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2024-04-30/225/) but the Irish government has no intention to change it.","I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs to prevent billionaires never selling their investments and just borrowing against them, this avoiding ever paying tax. Surprised the 40% rule also applies to non billionaires though?","A few things worth considering. The US operates a worldwide taxation system so US citizens are generally taxed on their worldwide income, as opposed to Ireland which operates a territorial taxation system (except for rental income) so it might be worthwhile maintaining separate accounts for you and your spouse. Also, probably not relevant for a while yet but if you hold US assets (irrespective of your citizenship), you are subject to FET (federal estate taxes) after a pretty small threshold of $60k - so, while your spouse can't avoid that, you can and should. While the 41% exit tax and 8 year deemed disposal is a truly awful regime, investing via an Irish executive pension currently has no contribution limits (albeit with heavier fees than US options) so the tax sheltered option for building wealth in Ireland is actually better than the US currently while the ""taxable"" route is better in the US. So, you could invest pre-tax income via a tax sheltered executive pension in Ireland and your spouse could invest post-tax income in a taxable account in the US (you don't have to be living in the US but you do need to be a US citizen), best of both worlds. There are no accumulating ETFs in the US unfortunately so you'll have to take dividends from the taxable account and pay tax on them; but still significantly better than the taxable option in Ireland. Hope that provides some food for thought at least.",A lot of Irish law is just badly designed.   There‚Äôs no good arguments for this setup and the only reason it is that way is because the legislators didn‚Äôt really understand the subject matter.,Does Ireland have gift taxes? Maybe you could give all your money to your spouse and have them buy the US-domiciled ETFs you want.,"If billionaires never sell investments, how do they service their debt? Can I do what they are doing?",In the US when they die they get to pass on the estate to their children on a stepped up tax basis. At this point all the ‚Äúgains‚Äù are reset to 0 for tax purposes. The gains still exist but the children don‚Äôt pay any taxes when selling stock. So that‚Äôs how the debt is paid off.

I'm the person behind the Pelosi Tracker &amp; built the first platform in the world that allows you to copy them automatically, so I wrote up a quick analysis of what would happen.  1) Everyone wants this  86% of Americans   87% of Republicans   88% of Democrats   81% of Independents  All support some sort of ban on congressional stock trading  2) The bill has meat on it, but it's complicated  * Bans Congress from trading 90 days after the bill is signed * Bans spouses and dependent children from trading stocks starting in March 2027 * If one violates the bill, the penalty is 10% of the value of the asset traded  To put that penalty into context, in the last three years over $45,000,000 of stock trades violated the Stock Act  If that penalty existed, it would have been $4M+ in fines for our beloved politicians  The penalty currently is $250/filing. That's less than some parking tickets  3) But ... What would happen to Pelosi?  For those unaware, her trades are in joint with her millionaire investment professional husband, Paul  Since he's a ""spouse""  It seems like her style of trading would continue to be allowed until 2027 And also this brings into question if it's legal to limit a spouse from trading, especially if it's their full time job  TLDR: If it passes, her portfolio is here to stay, until 2027  4) Where it gets complicated is around the topic of spouses/dependents  A large number of the trades filed are on behalf of congress people's spouses/children  For example, Ro Khanna (D) supports the ban. However, he's technically filed almost $200M of trades in the last 3 years  Yet, almost none of the trades have been by him. They all are filed as ""Spouse"" or ""Child"".  Will it be legal to limit his kid from trading?  Who knows.  Also it's no secret that Politicians are rich. &amp; a number of their spouses/children work directly in finance  Dan Goldman (D) is the heir of the Levi Strauss   Mitt Romney (D) used to be the CEO at Bain   Maria Salazar (R)'s husband is the chairman of an investment firm  5) But here's the problem  ""If you ban the politicians but let their spouse trade, then they'd just do the insider trading instead of the Politician""  I get this comment on every piece of content I put out. And it's right, AKA why this is hard  6) So who would this affect right away?  Pretty much any Politician who files as ""Self""  The most notable ones we've seen include Markwayne Mullin (R), Tommy Tuberville (R), Sheldon Whitehouse (D), Gary Peters (D), and a couple others  Again though, most file via spouse/child  7) The bill was signed by 20 congressmen: 16 Democrats &amp; 4 Republicans  Out of those 20, only 2 have traded in the last three years.

Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, advised having a portion of one's retirement portfolio in safe bond-like investments, and he said social security to the average person is worth about $400,000 and can be thought of in the same vein as bonds.

investing,Jul,1dyugwd,Take Social Security at 62 or 70? Interesting thought. ,"As of right now if I begin to draw Social Security at age 62, I will receive $2600 per month. If I wait to withdraw Social Security until age 70, I will receive $4600 per month. $2000 more per month. Sounds great!   Let‚Äôs do some maths. If I take it at 62 and invest that $2600 per month, get an average return per year of 8%, at age 70 I‚Äôd have approximately $350k. So $2600 per month and $350k. Then at age 70 I would start to withdraw $2000 per month, while letting the rest of the principal appreciate at an average of 8% per year. So after age 70 that gives me a total of $4600 per month in perpetuity, and at age 90 I‚Äôd still have the $4600 per month plus around $500k in the investment account.   If I just wait til 70 to start drawing SS, I will get $4600 per month, but have NO lump sum in investments. And at 90 I‚Äôd still be getting $4600 per month with no big $$ in investments.   Am I missing something - it seems to be a no brainer as long as you can either continue to work those 8 years, or can live off your 401/retirement alone those 8 years.","You could very well come out ahead. You do seem to be making a few assumptions, though:   1) You don't immediately need the money to survive   2) You'll get 8% -- or even any gain at all   3) You'll live to see the benefits at all  Any or all of these could be bad assumptions. It all depends on your risk tolerance and really how much you have saved for retirement. I will note that the one advantage of Social Security is it being extremely low risk: you'll likely get the money (or some fraction of it if it isn't fully funded).","One last thing is healthspan vs lifespan.  You might enjoy a trip to Hawaii at 62 and not enjoy it at all at 72, so the extra money has more bang for your buck early even though you have less of it","There are a number of issues.  1. As others have mentioned, you're ignoring taxes. Sounds like 85% of your SoSec will be taxed, and assuming a 22% rate, that would net your $2600/mo to about $2100/mo. Then, taxes on the investment side.  2. ""...I will receive $2600 per month. If I wait to withdraw Social Security until age 70, I will receive $4600 per month."" Let's assume for discussion that age 62 is ""now"". What you're really saying is, ""As of now, I can receive $2600 per month. If I wait to withdraw Social Security until age 70, I will receive $5400 per month assuming a 2% annual inflation rate between now and then. My Social Security at 70, if I start collecting $2600 per month now, will be $3,050 at age 70 with the same inflation."" What was a $2000 differential has become a $2,350 differential.  3. Your withdrawal rate -- $2,000/month x 12 months = $24,000; that divided by $350,000 is 6.9% -- far in excess of the standard 4% rule that's talked about. Granted, you may not be planning on 30 years. If you bump that $2000 up by the same 2% inflation factor, you're talking about $28,000, or 8% of your investment balance -- double the 4% rate. Conveniently your (likely highly optimistic) earnings rate.  4.

I ran the same analysis as OP a while back and reached the same conclusion. If you don't actually need your SS income and are just trying to maximize your net worth, you should generally start drawing SS as early as possible. As long as you die before you're in your 90's (which, let's face it, most of us will) you are likely to come out ahead. Obviously depends on investment performance, but that's a bet I'm willing to take.",If we all knew when we would die - we'd all wait. However some of us may not have longeivity in their family.

investing,Jul,1dwr6zc,"Goldman paper ""Gen AI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?""","&gt;Tech giants and beyond are set to spend over $1tn on AI capex in coming years, with so far little to show for it. So, will this large spend ever pay off? MIT‚Äôs Daron Acemoglu and GS‚Äô Jim Covello are skeptical, with Acemoglu seeing only limited US economic upside from AI over the next decade and Covello arguing that the technology isn‚Äôt designed to solve the complex problems that would justify the costs, which may not decline as many expect. But GS‚Äô Joseph Briggs, Kash Rangan, and Eric Sheridan remain more optimistic about AI‚Äôs economic potential and its ability to ultimately generate returns beyond the current ‚Äúpicks and shovels‚Äù phase, even if AI‚Äôs ‚Äúkiller application‚Äù has yet to emerge.

If you're expecting to return, purchase a home, furnish it, drive to work, etc., then you need to reduce risk on some portion of the 100K.   OTH, if you truly don't need the money, and don't expect to use it in the next 5-7 years, then Dollar Cost Average (DCA) into something like the US Total Market (SCHB or VTI or ?). $4-5K invested each month will run out to 20-25 months. Along the way you're thinking on risk may change, and you decide on something to complement the Total Stock Market investment.  Also, you should have this 100K in a brokerage where you have access to Money Market funds and CD's, which are still hovering around 5% return (but will drop in the future).

However, you also have other options. If you open a Fidelity brokerage account, the cash position gives you more than 5% interest.

investing,Jul,1dx0f9u,What exactly is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with dividend investing?,[deleted],"You make an important distinction that a lot of people starting out don't make - dividends are not free money and it's important to know that.  There are plenty of situations where where dividends can be interesting and they can reduce volatility but if you are looking to grow your money and fund retirement say, SP500 asset value growth has historically outpaced dividend stocks growth + dividends in the long term","Dividend investing used to make a lot more sense 20+ years ago when you wanted to have a nice little income stream from your investments at a low cost. Since there were lots more fees (and higher fees) for trades, it didn't make as much sense to sell positions to get some income from your equities. Dividend investing came in handy back then because you didn't get hit with those high transactions fees and could get some money out of your equity investments.  Today, with no cost trading, we don't need dividends to get money out of our equity positions. Just sell x% of your holdings and that's it. No transaction costs and you get to invest in all the stocks you want, regardless of dividends.  Also, dividend paying stocks typically aren't growing as quickly as non-dividend payers, so if you only focused on dividends you might be cutting your potential returns short.",I feel like the ‚Äúnot free money‚Äù thing is a red herring that gets so much time wasted on the semantics of it. IMO the real point is that chasing yield typically leads to worse returns than investing in total market indexes.,"Because of taxes. You pay taxes on dividends every year, reducing your net returns. As long as you don't create a taxable event, a growth stock with no/low dividends will keep compounding ""tax-free"".",this is one of those threads that OP is going to ignore comments answering the question and continue to argue nonsensically with one-off replies   it must be some psychological condition because it seems like 5% of all reddit posts are like this,"&gt;I feel like if my portfolio is kicking out $30-40k/yr, I would feel more comfortable with a downturn of 25, 30, even 50% as long as that stream of income is steady or at least relatively steady.  If you want to withdraw $30-40k/yr you can, but you don't need to generate $30-40k of dividends for that. Dividend ""income"" is an illusion.   &gt;I know dividends get cut in deep recessions, but if my goal isn‚Äôt purely max total return 30 years from now, wouldn‚Äôt dividend investing make sense?  Only two variables determine how long your money will last in retirement: your rate of withdrawal, and your rate of total return. Dividends don't change this math.  If two investors start with the same amount of money, and their total returns are the same, and they withdraw the same amount of money each year, their money will last equally as long. It doesn't matter which one receives more dividends.","Dividends aren't wrong or bad. They are one component of total return, and an important component too.  The reason dividend investing gets criticized is because strategies that underperform in total returns are pushed because ""they pay more dividends"". Maximizing your return is all that matters, so dividend focused strategies are irrelevant.","Investing in stocks because they pay a dividend makes as much sense as investing in stocks because they start with the letter A.

With inflation etc if you look recently a 1-2% change looks massive while 50 years ago a 10% change looked the same but they could both be relatively the same value in their timeframe etc. Logarithmic compares the % changes more than the dollar amount.,I made a picture/charts of what the others are telling you.   Logarithmic vs linear scale  https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fn92d87fvu3ad1.jpeg,Here‚Äôs both logarithmic and inflation adjusted:  https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data,"It's always been exponential, not linear.",Thank you both for repeating what the first guy said.,It's a 50 year chart and it happened once. 'Patience is virtue' lol  Miss gains and dividends waiting for it.  The big problem there was most people didn't have spare money to buy.  Besides those reasons it's a great plan! ;),Have you tried setting the scale to logarithmic?,"Sure. Except in 2008 a lot of people were unemployed and at risk of losing their home so they had to sell shares rather than buy shares.   Even if you had income, it was also pretty damned scary to continue putting it into an asset that was half the value and had 0% growth over the past decade, when all the economic and financial news was terrible and indicating that it might drop even farther. It's easy to look at a long term chart and see it following an linear long term trend - it's much harder to experience a 50% drop in real time.","Logarithmic corrects for things that adjust by a percentage.  a 10% increase from 100 is the same value wise as 10% increase on 5500, but the linear chart doesn‚Äôt show it.  Inflation is the scary part since it‚Äôs percentage based too.  2021-2023 saw 6% and 7% inflation.  As did the 70s and 80s.  I‚Äôve made a ton since 2020, but a good part of it is eaten by 2 years of over 5% inflation.",[deleted]

investing,Jul,1e5k8n6,Would an All In Fund that only ever held the single largest stock have beaten global indices?,"One of the arguments for investing in the S&amp;P 500 is that it's cheaper (in the UK, net of tax) than global index funds, like the FTSE All-World. And you get most of the same risk-return profile, because the US stock market is the largest market.  What if that logic was extended further?  Imagine a fund that only ever held one stock. The stock that had the largest market cap weighting in the (publicly listed) investment universe. It only ever traded (1) when the #1 stock changed, and (2) to reinvest dividends. Very few trades reduces holding costs to a minimum.  Today, the all in fund would hold 100% AAPL.  5 years ago, it held 100% MSFT.  In 1990, it held 100% XOM.  [https://www.finhacker.cz/top-20-sp-500-companies-by-market-cap/](https://www.finhacker.cz/top-20-sp-500-companies-by-market-cap/)  Would the fund have a better return than, say, the FTSE All-World, or the S&amp;P 500? I expect the standard deviation to be (a lot) higher, but which would risk return ratios - Sortino, Martin, ... - favour?  UPDATE  My thanks to [these commenters](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1e5k8n6/comment/ldnyi7b/). Price return for the All In Index is easy to calculate. For the period 1990 - 2024 I get 12% PR annualized. Compared to 8% PR for the S&amp;P 500.  The current beta for AAPL is 1.24. The Sharpe ratio is thus &gt; 20% better.  My intuition for this question came from the statistical idea of representation. If there are any fund managers reading this, my DMs are always open.","This should be trivial to model, have a crack at it and let us know.","My hunch is that it underperforms the market by alot, but it would be interesting to see.","You can buy the #1 stock, hold it, then sell it when the #1 spot changes. Why do you need a fund doing it for you?

Except for expense ratio, which the poster is talking about.","I need to double check my data because this is kind of unbelievable, but I‚Äôm coming up with 4,134% between January 1995 and January 2020.

investing,Jul,1e0az9h,How far do you think we are in the AI stock market hype cycle?,"Early stages? Mid stages? Late stages?  Tech valuations are getting very rich, to their second-highest levels ever, even during the current 15+ year secular bull market (March 2009-present) marked by tech sector outperformance.  - Apple: $3.6 trillion, 36x earnings  - Microsoft: $3.5 trillion, 41x earnings  - NVIDIA: $3.3 trillion, 79x earnings  Right now, we‚Äôre still in a stage of the mania where simply saying ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is enough to make a stock rocket higher. Since unveiling Apple Intelligence on June 10, Apple stock has risen by 21% ($700 billion) on analyst predictions of an ‚Äúupgrade supercycle.‚Äù Moderna stock shot up 60% higher in May after announcing a partnership with Open AI.  Eventually, this will give way to a ‚Äúshow me the money‚Äù phase in which investors need to see actual profits to sustain these valuations. But clearly we‚Äôre not there yet. For the companies selling shovels in the current gold rush (NVIDIA, TSMC, etc.) they‚Äôre generating spectacular earnings right now, but the question is how sustainable they‚Äôll be for the longer term. Wall Street has their earnings growth priced in as being permanent.  Possible turning points:  Apple will release its AI-enhanced iPhone 16 this autumn. If sales are weak, it‚Äôll be clear that consumers aren‚Äôt as jazzed up about AI as markets are predicting. But the last few years haven‚Äôt had any notable upgrades at all, so there could still be an upgrade cycle.  On the corporate side, it‚Äôs harder to predict. Corporations including financial services &amp; other non-tech industries have been willing to pay Microsoft &amp; Open AI hand over fist because it‚Äôs the latest hot technology; mentioning AI boosts their stock prices; and they‚Äôre always looking for ways to boost efficiency.  For Big Tech, there‚Äôs a widespread belief that this is a can‚Äôt-fail arms race, given the winner-takes-all nature of the industry. Therefore, it‚Äôs possible that even if consumers aren‚Äôt too hyped about AI, Big Tech corporations will gladly continue to pay NVIDIA billions every year. Especially since M&amp;A has grinded to a halt due to regulatory scrutiny, they have to find something to do with all this money.  Central banks:  On top of all this, you have central banks around the world itching to ease and pump markets higher. Alan Greenspan‚Äôs 1995 rate cuts likely extended the life of the first Internet bubble by a few years. But at least he recognized it was a bubble and popped it in 2000 by raising rates, even as inflation was below-target &amp; decelerating. Jerome Powell, who‚Äôs worth over $50 million and highly invested in stocks, has said he‚Äôd do no such thing, and only high inflation can lead to more rate hikes.  ‚Äî  What are your thoughts? How high will the market &amp; tech valuations go? Will this lead to a market crash or a new plateau?","Given that everyone here is saying that we‚Äôre at the peak, I think we are probably going lot higher.","Hmm, top comment says we're going a lot higher, so I suspect we're near the peak","Long term, AI is the next industrial revolution. There will be money made from it everywhere.  Short term, well, good luck timing the market.  If you're worried and have large gains, it's reasonable to sell a large block to get your reward from the risk you have taken, and then DCA back slowly. Use your profits to buy a house or something worthwhile to your net worth in the meantime.","I think we're in the ""frothy peak"" where most of the money has already been deployed but we haven't \*quite\* seen people start to acknowledge that it's all been a waste.","What happened to internet stocks after 2000?  Companies that made $0 their entire existence... they didn't fare well, but internet based companies took off again.   The ability of a company to make essentially unlimited money, with limited expenses/labour was viewed pretty positively by the markets.  Amazons, Ebay, Facebook, Google, etc.  Right now, we have companies that are still building up, only a few players that are really buying in heavily, probably carrying a good chunk of the market as well, but still only a few.     We'll likely have a decent pull back in AI spending, but those that make it work will suddenly be spending 10x more, and then those who want to play in the same general game will have to spend 15x more to catch up.  It's like saying when will they stop spending on cloud expansion... uh. apparently never.   It might not be hockeystick like but it's still growing and not a bubble.  Bubbles that crash a market hard are generally not supported by anything so when the people stop believing, they crash, but these AI stocks have buyers.   The buyers aren't buying at a pace that shows absurdity, they're buying what they can use + some expansion.  It's not going to suddenly collapse to 0, I could see a pull back in spending but others will pick up the slack likely.",Until the revenues can justify the expectation. I will give 1-2 qtrs to see the earnings. I am on hold invest in AI. Most I took profit and put in safer plays.,"There is still room to grow as it takes a while to implement ai in companies and see if they work. Normally a 3-5 year plan. Most likely the stock market will have a major correction before thanks to some foreseeable issues like the elections, the wars, inflation or high debt. Or even a huge spike in unemployment and recession","Looking at the Gartner hype cycle, we‚Äôre probably around the peak of inflated expectations, if not still approaching it. However, I don‚Äôt think the trough of disillusionment will be a collapse, and I think the plateau of productivity (which might not even really plateau) is very high, with a lot of room to run over the next decade. We might be bubbly relative to current capabilities and productivity enhancement, but there are a lot of real productivity gains on the way, imho.","I agree with this post. The AI stock hype is all promises, but these valuations are gonna crash and burn like they always do. We're heading for a 'show me the f\*\*\*ing money' moment, and whether these companies deliver on their AI bullshit will separate the winners from the losers. And screw Jerome Powell‚Äîhe's too chicken shit to raise rates, so get ready for a goddamn inflation-fueled market where everything's overvalued thanks to the damned money printer.","given that there are people on earth, we're going alot higher"

You're basically comparing a guaranteed ~3.7% return (which seems low, even with the principal paydown) against the historical 7-10% of the S&amp;P.    Couple of things to consider:  * **Seattle Market:**  Is Ballard still appreciating rapidly?  If so, that 3.7% rental yield might be deceivingly low in the long run. * **Your Risk Tolerance:** Owning a rental is less liquid than index funds. How comfortable are you with market swings? * **Effort:** Do you enjoy being a landlord (even indirectly)?  Factor in the time cost.

I told her she could do better by just dumping the money in an index fund.  She was very reluctant to gamble on boyfriend's advice.  A couple of years ago, she earned 100K through a real estate transaction and was about to give it to Lincoln and I begged her just put in an indexed fund in Fidelity instead.  She reluctantly did.  Her $100K has now become $140K in just 2 years.  Her money managers on the other hand can't even match inflation rate and are charging her high fees for that service.  She is now sold on the idea to move her money out of there, but believes that Lincoln has a death grip on her money.  Every time she has asked to cash something out, they try to discourage it using scare tactics.  At this time she does not want to go on a battle with them to get her money out.

However, once I educated myself on what feed drag does to a portfolio over a decades, as well as active versus managed funds, I dumped them. They had me in a lot of expensive funds, and my portfolio was unnecessarily complicated. They certainly made me a lot more money than I would have if I kept doing it in my old way.

investing,Jul,1e4x2wu,Interest rate cuts -- which indexes will benefit?,"Hello -  Can someone explain the conventional wisdom on what forthcoming interest rate cuts might mean for the various indexes?  My understanding has been the following, but would love to hear more educated opinions.  In a high rate environment, the large and mega caps are going to do relatively better. This is because they have huge cash flow and don't actually need to borrow money. So the NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 will do relatively better as they get weighted toward the large and mega caps.  As rates tick lower and credit becomes more available, that's good news for smaller companies that actually need to borrow money.  So that's good news for the Russell 2000, where the small caps are. This also an opportunity, because small caps have lagged large caps of late and there may be some under-appreciated value there.  Within the S&amp;P 500, this probably means ""rotation"" -- money moving out of the large and mega caps, and into small and mid cap stocks within the index.  Am I understanding this right?","You are correct. We're already seeing rotation into lagging small caps with anticipated rate cuts. but keep in mind aggressive rate cuts tend to happen with economy is slowing, which also tends to be  really rough on small caps. There is no way to know for sure how it will play out, which is why diversification is important.","I would expect infrastructure ETFs, like PAVE, to do well. I assume that rate cuts mean more people and businesses will be borrowing money to fund construction projects. Interested to hear if my assumption is actually right or not.","It kind of depends on the severity and pace of the cuts. This is due to the bond market's size and impact on other markets when bond prices rise dramatically.  Historically, when emergency rate cuts are introduced in response to economic weakness, the short-term outlook for equities is horrible. Rapid rate cuts means rapid appreciation in bond values, which forces financial institutions to quickly and dramatically shift their portfolio weight into bonds. This sucks in liquidity from other markets, especially those seen as higher risk like equities. Large institutions with pension funds, retirement funds, etc. drive most of this activity.  This is why, during recessions, you'll almost always see stock market bottoms hit 3-6 months into a rate cutting cycle. The market rebalances in response to high bond values, driving equities down, creating general fear and demand for safe assets like bonds, forcing weaker/overleveraged financial players to liquidate big winners to offset losses, driving more fear, more flight into bonds, etc.   Keep in mind that the bond market is roughly 4-5x larger than equities markets. It's a behemoth, but in recent history, it has been relatively boring as rates have been held steady at unprecedented lows. This changes during big rate shifts and credit events.",Rates get cut and REITs are going up.,&gt; Anything that uses interest rates   And that specifically includes REITs.  Real Estate Investments that have been suffering for a few years should react positively in a VERY short timeframe.,"Let‚Äòs be careful with correlation and causation. Why were rates cut around the financial crisis? Was it to inject fast liquidity into the collapsing markets? Or were the markets collapsing due to liquidity being injected? It‚Äòs easy to look at a chart and assume rate cuts triggers something else, however often it‚Äòs the FED reacting to an event post-fact. So watch out for the reasoning why FED would cut rates (weak job markets, deflation signs, etc.) and that may give us a hint on what could happen short term. Interesting times‚Ä¶",Generally The market falls a lot sometime after the Fed starts cutting.  So Bond indexes are historically where to be.  When the stock market crashes then you rotate in.  See 2000 &amp; 2008.,If you are thinking about it as a retail investor it‚Äôs already priced into the market.,Im holding PAVE for the same reason. Surely all that money from that Infrastructure package a couple years back has to make its way to these companies.

investing,Jul,1dsxid5,The stock market and general health of the economy...,"It has been a really strange few months. It seems like when there is bad economic news (for example: unemployment is worse than expected or manufacturing is worse than expected ), the stock market goes up. The one exception is inflation.   The reason is (afaiu) is that investors are betting a weak economy will force interest rates cuts.   But this seems insane... Investors are buying American companies because they as a whole are getting weaker. This doesn't make sense. What am I missing?   Example: June manufacturing data misses expectations, stocks climb https://finance.yahoo.com/video/june-manufacturing-data-misses-expectations-143604126.html",&gt;What am I missing?  stock market does not reflect the economy,"I think the general idea is that there is a massive amount of money sitting in Money Market accounts and short-term Treasuries that is collecting a reasonable 4%-5%, with almost no risk. This is what people are referring to ""dry powder"". Since the markets are incredibly speculative, they can move very VERY fast. So the thinking is that once there is a clear sign that rates will go down (e.g. bad economic data), there will be a rush of money from those low-risk, high-yield accounts into the market... which would cause the markets to climb.  Everyone wants to catch a ride on that wave, so the little increases in the market on bad data is people who think ""this is it, I'm getting in at the bottom of the swell"", and buy-in.  The only problem with this stance is that the excess money in the system was mainly caused by covid-19 stimulus (not from the US Govt... but from the Federal Reserve and other central banks like ECB/JCB). The Fed and central banks are now trying desperately to get that liquidity out of the system to reduce inflation, without jolting the markets (e.g. without causing that wave that people are waiting for). So it's creating a lot of mixed signals and confusion.","No, with ‚Äúbad‚Äù news like unemployment going up, that meant that inflation would start to come down. The main boogeyman was the fed trying to get inflation under control.","A lot of newb investors miss this. When the economic news is good sometimes the stock market will actually go down because of the implications for monetary policy, and similarly the other way around.","So what is a value of a stock? In simple term it is the present value of all future cash flows . Well $1 in 10 years is not worth $1 today  So how much is $1 in ten years worth today? It depends largely on the risk free rate, if the risk free rate averages 5% over the 10 year period well it's worth approx 0.61  If the risk free rate is 1% its worth about .91 cents today  So if investors think the average interest rate over the next 5-10-20-30 years will be slightly lower well the PV of those future cash flows goes up.   Sometimes it helps to think of stocks as like 100 year bonds , although bonds are easier to price as the cash flows are mostly known with stocks not only do you have to discount future cash flows you have to estimate them as well  However thinking about them as ultra long duration perpetual bonds can help you understand how/why they might move","What you're missing is that the US economy is actually doing very well currently. Stop reading the negative news and reddit posts about ""increasing unemployment"" (unemployment is pretty much at an all-time low), inflation / ""cost of living crisis"" / housing crisis, all of which are actually symptoms of a strong economy, low unemployment, increased wages and high demand",As they should be.

Not saying those 2 events will happen, just saying that's the percentile for SP500 forward PE right now.","Higher unemployment means lower labor costs.  It also means weaker demand for companies' goods and services. So higher unemployment can be good or bad news, depending. The effect of inflation on a company depends on how it affects the company's costs and profits. Again, it depends."
investing,Jul,1ebbn2j,Explain taxes on investments like I‚Äôm 5,"Let‚Äôs say I have $100k in a brokerage account, and $100k in a Roth IRA. If I am 65 with $0 of income, and I withdraw all of my money from each account, then what would the tax situation be?   For clarity I mean if I liquidated my brokerage account vs making a qualified withdrawal from my Roth IRA.  Example: If I withdraw 100k dollars from a brokerage account then I will be in the 37% tax bracket and pay 37,000 in capital gains tax. If I withdraw from my Roth IRA then I would have an income of $100k and pay income taxes on that 100k. (I know this is wrong, but it‚Äôs an example of what I mean)   Sorry if this is confusing, but I am very confused. I don‚Äôt understand retirement accounts vs regular brokerage accounts. Thank you all!","You need to get your head around what counts as ""income"" when you're talking about investments. Income taxes are paid on INCOME. Taking money out of an account is not ""income."" Do you pay taxes every time you take money out of your savings account or take cash out of an ATM? No.   You turning money in an account into cash in your hand is not a ""taxable event"" (in the cases you are mentioning).  Let's look at the Roth first. You paid income tax on that Roth money already, back in your working life when you earned it. You don't pay tax on that money again, and what's more *you also don't pay tax on the gain.* It doesn't matter how much you take out of the Roth in a qualified withdrawal. You pay $0 in taxes.  Now look at the regular account. INCOME in investments is made when you sell an asset for more than you bought it for. If you bought the securities in that account for 10k and sold them for 100k, then your income is 90k. Long term capital gain for most people is 15%. You pay $13.5k in taxes. If you bought those securities for 90k and sold them for 100k, your income is $10k. You pay $1500 in taxes. (If you bought them for 120k and then the stocks went down, you *lost* 20k, and not only pay no taxes, you could use those losses to offset other possible income.)",Pro shit,"You don‚Äôt get taxed at all when you *buy* stocks. You only pay tax when you *sell*.  Again, it‚Äôs *income* tax. You only make money on stocks when you sell them for more than you bought them for.",It's only 90k if you're married and filing together. Otherwise it's 45k. I would imagine most people with any significant capital gains are going to be making more than that.,"yes the gains are taxable the moment you sell, regardless of what you do with the proceeds.","Quick caveat: 15% for most people only applies to this subreddit.¬†  *Most people* make less than $90k a year, and therefore pay 0% capital gains tax.","Furthermore you only pay taxes on the profits, aka capital gains",He‚Äôs 5. Explaining cost basis calculation for dividend bearing securities can wait till he turns six.,Roth would be tax free withdrawal. Brokerage would depend if you realize any gains by selling your positions. Long term gains anything over a year can be taxed up to 20% short term gains less than a year will be taxable at income tax rate. That‚Äôs it. Basically all earnings are taxed in brokerage.,"ROTH IRA retirment account has no taxes on it at withdrawal as you paid taxes on the money put in. There are penalties, etc. if you take out money before retirement.   Withdrawals from a Traditional IRA/401K are simply taxed as income (same as if money from a job). You did not pay taxes on the money you put in so you owe taxes on everything taken out.  On non-retirement (simple brokerage) accounts, taxes are due when the asset is sold at a profit (does not have to be withdrawn from the account). If the assets are held for less then a year then the profit is taxed as income (short term gain). If held more then a year the profit is taxed as a capital gain which is typically lower then income tax rates. Dividends might also be taxed.  Above is a simple ELI5. Taxes are typically not simple. It's more complicated then that. Yada, yada, yada."

The conventional thinking is that the corporates are perceived to be more risky than the sovereign guarantee bonds by US treasuries. At longer tenures, we do observe the expected with US treasuries being the most expensive (lowest yielding).     Also, another question. Do CDs (upto FDIC limit) have exactly the same guarantee as treasury bonds. Or in case of insolvency some instrument gets treated differentially.","Treasury bonds are direct obligations of the US government while CDs are insured by the FDIC which is an agency of the government.  In theory the credit risk is equivalent, but in an extreme situation I think the government would default on the FDIC guarantee before it would default on its own borrowings.","If you look at the Book (Market Depth)  for the bonds I bet there are no Bids for those. So, you just see crazy Ask yields. Nobody is buying them. Maybe when the market opens they even out? The Bid/Ask ranges on corporate seem pretty wide on some of the others. Tread carefully.    CDs are insured by the FDIC in case the associated bank fails. Treasuries are not insured. The U.S. Government is all the insurance one needs to trust they will be paid (if we get to a point where treasuries are not paid it's likely we have problems money won't solve).","The US government no longer has an AAA credit rating. There are exactly two companies with AAA credit rating - Microsoft and Johnson&amp;Johnson. The better credit rating makes a (small) default price premium on the corporates not crazy.  In addition, Treasuries don't pay state tax. There may be a (small) tax preference price premium on corporates to compensate in general.","While I‚Äôd agree with this in principle, I actually think the FDIC guarantee would hold up more than the federal government guarantee. FDIC guarantee has a fund backing it that banks have to contribute to.   Based on other countries, government default would be more likely than depositors not getting their money back. But we‚Äôre talking about extreme of extremes","Its sort of circular logic, if the government defaults every bank in the USA would be insolvent because banks also tend to hold lots of bonds  FDIC doesn't have reserves to bail out a larger bank, they had to go out and raise funds to bail out SVB and FRB by issuing debt , their debt is backed by the full faith and credit of the USA government as well","Munis are tax free in some cases , federal , state if you live in the state, so the rates are always lower because they are tax free  However with corporate bonds they really don't trade on a highly liquid market there may be no bids on these bonds and you are just seeing people setting weird ask prices",I don't get it either. If you look at corporate bonds most are callable which makes them even less desirable when the market expects interest rates to go down. They are also taxable in the state unlike treasuries. They should be paying a much higher yield than treasuries.,"The muni market is a bit inefficient, but the basic answer is to compare after tax yields as they're taxed differently.","Treasury bonds are directly backed by the U.S. government, while CDs are insured by the FDIC, which is a government agency. Technically, they have the same credit risk, but in a worst-case scenario, I believe the government would let the FDIC guarantees fail before defaulting on its own debt.",u/concrete_annuity and u/InterviewLeast882  Are you the same person or is one of you a new AI reddit bot?

Repairing the issue is not something you can do remotely, it literally requires a physical person to access the machine, reboot it in safe-mode and delete some files one machine at a time. If your machine uses Bitlocker encryption, you need to make sure you have the Bitlocker backup key to every single one of those machines.   So you have an update that auto-deployed on a bunch of Windows machines that requires manual 1-at-a-time intervention to fix. Have we ever had an incident on this scale?

Most other outages I've seen usually are resolved by the service that screwed up fixing their mistake and everything returning to functionality. This is the first time I've seen an outage that literally ""soft-bricks"" machines, and requires almost physical interaction with the devices to fix this.   Because of this lack of ""scalable"" way to roll back from this issue, I expect like 90% of services to be restored pretty quickly, while the last 10% will be long-tail effort of people forgetting that they have a Windows machine sitting somewhere that they need to manually interface with an fix.  My expectation is that Q3 results will probably be a bit down from this, because it will be a non-trivial drag on any growth companies were experiencing. I don't think this will impact 5+ years, except for compounding interest suffering from the drag caused by this in Q3.

I don't believe any anti-virus provider that doesn't basically live next to the OS development team knows what the hell they are doing. We give anti-virus software way too much access to low level systems such that the you're more likely to cause more financial damage from a bad update like this than you do from the protection you are providing.  Only Windows developers are going to properly know how to prevent Windows from unauthorized intrusions.

investing,Jul,1dtzxab, After 7 months of research I finally made my retirement plan ,"Imgur Link: [https://imgur.com/a/investment-plan-HJCEYyQ](https://imgur.com/a/investment-plan-HJCEYyQ)   This time last year, I didn't know what a bond was, what an ETF was, or the name of any investment platform. 7 months ago, I started learning about investments online with a goal to have a retirement plan before I turn 30. I am still learning, and I believe I will keep learning about investment all my life. But I am happy to say that today, I have a reasonably solid plan for my retirement and FIRE.  I want to share this plan with others, as it might benefit someone else, too. I would also appreciate any suggestions for improvements and your feedback. Let me explain my personal situation and each phase of the plan.  **Personal Situation:**   I live in the Netherlands with my partner. We have a dual income and no kids. We have a mortgage for 3.9% rate, which will be finished in 2053 (age 60). Our goal is to semi-retire (work part-time) at 55 and retire (live on passive income) at 65.  We have saved up 6months of emergency funds in a High Yields Saving Account.  **Accumulation Phase (Age 30-40):**   This is the first phase, and I am starting this with ‚Ç¨50k in cash. To be conservative, I have chosen an average monthly contribution of ‚Ç¨4k for the calculations. In reality, I am starting with a ‚Ç¨6.5k monthly contribution, which will go down as we have kids, but our salaries may also increase.  The goal in this phase is to maximize assets by taking risks. Assets contain some stocks to keep me actively trading and interested in learning more about investments. It will be large-cap blue-chip companies, and I will HODL if the investment goes down.  Growth ETFs and Core ETFs are added to handle diversification by sector. In this phase only accumulating US ETFs will be bought.  Gold is added as an inflation hedge. It is also added for its negative correlation to stocks and bonds. This will allow cashing out some money in an emergency when the stock market is down.  **Consolidation Phase (Age 40-50):**   In this phase, the goal is to protect the money accumulated so far. Lower monthly contributions have been considered to accommodate the expenses of growing kids and to factor in fluctuations in income.  The focus will be on adding geographical diversification. The risk will also be decreased by moving away from Stocks and Growth ETFs towards Core ETFs. Gold stays the same.  **Preparation Phase (Age 50-55):**   In this phase, the goal is to prepare for semi-retirement. Risk is further reduced by adding asset-type diversification. A gradual shift is made from the existing ETFs towards distributing ETFs and bonds.  High-risk assets (Stocks and Growth ETFs) are replaced by low-risk Value ETFs. Bond ETFs are introduced to decrease the risk further.  A High-Yield Savings Account is introduced for emergencies where immediate cash is needed. Gold stays the same.  **Semi-Retirement Phase (Age 55-65):**   This is when we start working part-time (20 or fewer hours per week). No further contributions to the portfolio from this point. It is expected that no withdrawals will be necessary during this phase, but to be safe, I have written down a ‚Ç¨2,500 withdrawal rate per month. This is when our mortgage will be over, and the kids are expected to move out, so monthly expenses should be reduced significantly.  In this phase, the goal is to generate a stable income while preserving the capital.  Core ETFs are replaced fully by low-risk Value ETFs and Bond ETFs. Gold and High Yield Savings Account stay the same.  Real Estate is added to get rental income. The plan is to buy a new home and rent the current one out since it will be too big for us after the kids move out. The spare time from going part-time can be spent on the landlord's duties.  **Retirement Phase (Age 65-death):**   This is the full retirement stage. The source of income will be pension and income from the assets. ‚Ç¨5k will be withdrawn every month. This is the inflation-adjusted value of our current monthly expenses.  The goal in this phase is to live off the income generated by the assets without depleting them. The assets stay the same with Real Estate removed. This is done to simplify the asset management. Further modifications in the portfolio might be made to reduce taxes, but the idea is to keep the portfolio simple enough for an old person to manage.  The lifestyle will also be simplified by moving to a small town or a cheaper country at retirement to reduce expenses further.  **Is this realistic?**  I have done some basic calculations. I assumed an average return of 3.5% (after taxes and costs), which gave me approx ‚Ç¨1.5M at the time of semi-retirement. If kept invested, this can last up to 60 years with 5k withdrawals. All the numbers I have used are very conservative, so I believe this is a realistic plan. Let me know if you think I missed some cost or risk factors.  The purpose of making this plan was to create a high-level investment strategy. It will be affected by changes in our financial situations, changes in our personal situations, changes in tax laws, changes in my knowledge about good investment practices, etc. The plan will be updated to cater for these changes.  Rebalancing from one phase to the other will be done gradually to minimize any losses. Sometimes, an asset will be held longer than desired. However, having a semi-retirement phase gives us the flexibility to readjust different phase durations. If the plan does well, we can fully retire earlier. If it doesn't work well, we can reduce the semi-retirement phase.  I hope you enjoyed reading this post.

Is there a better way to do this?  You should only expect higher returns for ***compensated*** risks. Not all risks are compensated, so sometimes taking more risk is just adding extra risk for no good reason. [This recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1cnjdvz/what_do_you_all_mean_by_uncompensated_risk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) has a lot of good explanations and links to more resources about compensated risk.  You should only expect to be compensated for risks that can't be diversified away. For example, stocks are inherently more risky than bonds, and that systematic risk can't be diversified away. There is no rule that says stocks will always outperform bonds, but we take that risk because even though the outcome is unknown, we're expecting to be compensated for taking that risk.  However, relative to the total stock market, there is no compensated risk for putting your money into ""Growth"" or ""Core"" stocks or investing in a single company/sector/country.  While these will all end up with different rates of return, there is no logical reason to assume any of them will outperform the total market. It's easy to look backwards and see where we could have invested our money for better returns, but it's not possible to do that looking forwards.","Ok, but it doesn‚Äôt make sense to buy gold in the accumulation phase",&gt;3.

investing,Jul,1eb0b4c,What do to with excess cash in a money market mutual fund?,"I live in the USA. I'm 64 and retired 2 years ago. I have a Roth IRA with $27K, an individual investment account with $83K and the money market account with $80K, following a recent large deposit when I closed out a checking account. I use bill pay (out of the money market account) to cover monthly expenses of about $3K. Later this year, my pension kicks in at about $900.00 a month. I am trying to hold off on social security until I'm 70. I have a high risk tolerance. So, it seems to me that $80K is a lot of money to have just collecting 4.97% interest monthly. I do need to keep some of it liquid in order to pay expenses. So, my questions are, should I invest about $50K to get higher returns and, if so, what funds do you recommend for a 2 or 3 yr approximate timeline? If I've left anything out, ask away. Thanks.","I like math and nobody has yet put it all together.  You need $36,000 annual income to pay your bills.  And that's not counting any emergencies or surprises, which we have to ignore for now.  Your assets of $190k will provide $7,600 per year at the widely accepted 4% ""safe"" withdrawal rate.  Your pension will add $10,800.  This puts you at $18,400 in income.  You are short $17,600, or $1,467 per month.  I assume that Social Security will make up that difference and hopefully a decent amount more.  So for now, you need to withdraw $7,600 + $17,600 = $25,200 or **13.3%** of your assets annually in order to make ends meet.  That's not at all sustainable, and frankly I would be very hesitant to keep it going for six years.  If the market continues to be bullish, you at least have a shot... but if we turn to another bear market, you should pivot and immediately claim your SS benefit without delay.  In my opinion, this reframes things a bit.  You need to *remain invested* at perhaps a 60/40 ratio of stock index funds to investment grade corporate bonds, with one year's expenses in a money market fund to pay bills without risk of loss.  Replenish the MMF each year.  And strongly consider claiming SS much earlier than age 70.",$2100 month for 5 years $126k plus the missing $900 you can be about $130k fixed income. I'd rather use bonds but you don't have excessive fixed income.    What you should do  though is highly dependent on the rest of the portfolio which you didn't discuss. You have a lot of longevity risk at 64.,"A 2-3 year timeframe is not enough to risk putting money needed for expenses in the stock market.  Is the $190k your total invested assets, or are you not telling us about the $2M hiding in your 401(k)?

If you want to swim in the stock market for potentially higher returns, it's tough, given your short time frame. A good low-fee index of stocks over a longer term of 5+ years has a better likelihood, but there's still a risk of loss. Without knowing your full situation and simply going off of being 64 years old, a good rule of thumb would be 36% stock and 64% bonds (matching bond percentage to age). You could look into the tried and true VOO ticker for the stock portion, but in general, you may benefit from any low-cost, well-diversified index-based investing. Whether to invest or not is on you and your risk tolerance. The only thing I would encourage you to balance in your thinking is, ""What if 50% of what I invest goes away...will I be okay?"" I bring that up mainly due to the overall resources, current age, and short timeframe posed of 2-3 years.","You may think you do, but you actually do not have high risk tolerance.  You're retired, and you have \~$180k in savings.   You have monthly expenses of $3k, and your pension covers $900 only.

It is worthwhile to wait from a math perspective, but this is not always the case from a life/health perspective. In some cases, it makes more sense to take it early and benefit from the income for longer. In cases where there is a spouse, that can also influence the planning of when to take it between the two.","As a 64-year-old with a 3-year investment span and the resources posted, are you saying he should be invested closer to a 70/30 stock-to-bond ratio? I'm interested to hear why. Can you share what makes you believe that ratio is prudent? I know it's stated having a high-risk tolerance (which most people have until they get punched in the mouth), but the short time frame and resources almost entirely negate that. The rule of thumb I am referring to is simply that, a starting point. If this person wants to take on more risk then tip the scale more towards stocks.       Keep in mind there are so many more things to consider regarding this case, such as what's the current health situation, stress testing the risk tolerance, what's plan B if investments fail, current insurance, any dependents, capable of working again if needed, etc.","money for yr 0-1: 100% high yield FDIC account  money for yr 1-3: 100% BNDW  money for yr 3-6: 20% VT, 80% BNDW.  money for yr 6-10: 40% VT, 60% BNDW.  money for yr 10+: 90% VT, 10% EDV.

investing,Jul,1dxqakz,Fixed income investing ‚Äî where to go when Fed rates go down.,"Hi. I‚Äôm a fixed income investor (if that is really investing) ‚Äî post retirement (71).  Given my age, I can‚Äôt imagine it would be wise to buy and hold anything terribly aggressive in the future.  Then again, I‚Äôm always open to suggestions.  Needless to say, I am not terribly well-versed in investment strategies.  I am new to this.  I think it‚Äôs pretty safe to say that at the end of 2024, the Fed will start lowering rates.    My situation is as follows:  I have a fairly decent income stream derived from large scale, private, real estate investments ‚Äî mostly large apartment complexes.  Each quarter I have been taking about 1/3 to 1/2 of my cash distributions and have been investing it in very low risk funds ‚Äî mostly based on treasuries.    When interest rates start to drop, no one will really have much time to sit there, scratch their heads, and decide what step to take next.  I need to be prepared.  So my question is basically **where do I go next**?    Traditional long term fixed income assets like CD‚Äôs and long term treasury funds seem a little bit restrictive. What comes to my mind are investments like relatively safe index, funds, etc. ‚Äî if they even exist.  If not, get riskier.    One thing I can say with a bit of surety, is that growing older requires a lot more money than people think. A lot of people seem to think that retirement is going to be very nice with $1 million in the bank. That‚Äôs just not true!  Being at that point, I would suggest 3 to 5 times that much (in 2024 dollars) for any sense of security.  Factor in inflation as well.  All sorts of crap can happen to you, in many forms. **So, it becomes time for me to get a little greedy and keep on building cash reserves**.    It also crossed my mind to start by taking $100K or $200k ‚Äî set them aside and invest them in a bit more risky funds to start. Kind of a way to just get my feet wet.  Then go from there.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.",Buying Treasury bonds at Treasury Direct (TD) is not a good idea for someone who might need to sell them quickly if they need the money.  Bonds held at TD cannot be sold at TD at all. You have to transfer them to a broker to sell. The process to do that is difficult and slow. Slow like 6-9 months for TD to transfer them.,Buying 10 year treasurys from treasurydirect would be a good idea if youre looking for fixed income. If/when rates go down theyll increase in value on the secondary market and can be sold immediately during market hours if you ever want to liquidate them early.¬†   There is an auction coming up for them in early august i believe.,"&gt;&gt; If I lock in rates by long term treasuries now, it will be difficult to liquidate.  If 10 year treasuries you buy today are paying 4.3% and rates drop to 3.3% the bonds bought today still pay 4.3%. There will be plenty of buyers to buy them if rates drop. They are very liquid. If rates drop, buyers will even pay more then face value to get them. A recent 10 year $1000 bond paying 4.3% would demand $1100 if rates drop to 3.3% (but you then have to re-invest your $1100 at the current 3.3% or spend it if that is what you need to do).  Or hold them and lock in the guaranteed 4.3% for the next 10 years.","&gt; Given my age, I can‚Äôt imagine it would be wise to buy and hold anything terribly aggressive in the future. Then again, I‚Äôm always open to suggestions.  Most funds are a blend, so you may be buying aggressive stuff by proxy.  I think in the end, you end up thinking in terms of proportion -- you can weight a portfolio towards more aggressive or more conservative, but there's usually some mix.    &gt; relatively safe index, funds, etc. ‚Äî if they even exist.  No safety this side of the grave!  But some indices are definitely more risky than others.  Are you familiar with the concept of ""beta""?  Beta is a measure  of how volatile something's price is, generally compared to the S&amp;P 500.  So the S&amp;P 500 has a beta of 1.0.  Something with a beta way over 1 tends to be a roller coaster -- for instance, Nvidia has a beta of ~1.7 right now.  Something with a beta of 0.6 would be much more boring from day to day.  Next... some sectors of the market are generally considered ""defensive"" because their business doesn't really depend on the economy to be good for demand.  For instance, utilities, healthcare, consumer staples (think wal mart).  People need those things rain or shine.    First for comparison:  * VOO -- S&amp;P 500.  Beta 1.0, 13.1% annualized total return over the last decade.  Defensive sector funds:  1. XLU -- Utilities.  Beta 0.75,  8.7% annualized total return over the last decade. 2. XLP -- Consumer staples.  Beta 0.58, 8.9% annualized total return over the last decade. 3. XLV -- Healthcare.  Beta 0.69, 10.8% annualized total return over the last decade.  And just for comparison in the other direction:  * XLK -- Tech.  Beta 1.25, 21.1% annualized total return over the last decade  Another ideas... The market is often split by growth vs value.  Growth companies tend to run on debt so they can grow faster, while value companies tend to make more steady profits and pay them out as dividends.  You can weight towards value for a smoother ride if you like.  * VUG -- Growth.  Beta 1.2, 15.9% annualized total return over the last decade * VTV -- Value. Beta 0.79, 10.0% annualized total return over the last decade  You can probably intuit the sort of things that happen here... The fed jacked up rates in 2022, so all the companies carrying debt (more likely growth companies funding their growth with debt) suddenly found their debt more expensive and their stocks took a hit.  VUG dropped ~34%, while VTV dropped about 4.5%.  Then in 2023 when it looked like rates had stopped climbing, VUG bounced back and gained 49% while VTV gained 7.5%.  Nobody knows what the future holds, but one would assume if rates drop, VTV goes up from people like you fleeing safe investments that don't make any money any more, and VUG goes up more because loose fiscal policy allows growth companies to grow faster.     ---   So you could make some portfolio of multiple funds, like X% growth and Y% value, or tailor your exposure to sectors using sector funds, like some percentage in the S&amp;P 500, then some smaller amounts in defensive sectors to limit downside.  Or you could try and hedge in assets less correlated with market returns, like gold, bonds, what-have-you.  I just don't have a good feel for how those behave so I didn't comment on them.","In summary, two simple suggestions are to consider FDVV (dividends) and JEPQ (covered calls).   My late father was a ‚Äúvalue investor‚Äù, a former stockbroker way back in the day. He did quite well.  In a low interest rate environment, he moved heavily into dividend funds, particularly VDIGX.  This made a lot of sense.    When the market ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù, the dividend-oriented funds held up better than the market as a whole (see 2022).  In a high interest rate environment, I suspect the dividend funds might not hold up as well as they did in 2022.  So, one option for you might be to roll into dividend funds.  Personally I like FDVV.  I still hold a lot of the VDIGX that I inherited, as a tip of the hat to my father.  These days we have a newer tool, the covered call ETFs. I went slowly, I now feel quite comfortable with JEPQ.  For me this has to be in an IRA, because JEPQ ‚Äúdividends‚Äù are taxed like ordinary income (I think that‚Äôs correct?).  I am retired as well.  I try to keep it simple and also enjoy retirement!","Better to just buy them at a broker to begin with. It is somewhat different from buying stocks and ETFs, but it isn't hard.  Do you know what a medallion stamp is and how to get one? Cause that's what you need for the paper form to send to TD to transfer bonds to a broker - and wait 6-9 months for the transfer. 6-9 months is a long time for money to be inaccessible.",People like you are doing that. A standard portfolio for a 71 year old is mostly bonds.,"That‚Äôs a good point.  All I know, is it living in an HCOL state (SF Bay area), a single years budget is quite a bit of money.  I mean property taxes And insurance alone run me about $40,000 a year.  So adding up other expenses, accordingly, you could see how one year‚Äòs cash is a lot of money.    I think all anybody can hope for is to augment whatever money they do have and try to live on that. For some people that might not be a problem and for others, it could limit things.  Possibly if I moved to a low cost of living area, it would be a lot simpler.  I‚Äôm not sure I want to do that though.","My real estate holdings are LP and LLC interests in large apartment complexes (mostly commercial/residential)).  I own pieces of the LP, and the LP is the entity that actually owns the property.  But I‚Äôm locked into ownership.  That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, but it is illiquid.  while I could sell some of the interests, it would be for 25 to 35 cents on the dollar.  These kind of investments are actually pretty good, and that I am able to take a lot of depreciation for tax purposes.    I don‚Äôt have any retirement funds, because when I was working, 401(k)s were actually pretty pathetic ‚Äî and Roth funds didn‚Äôt exist until I was about 50.  it didn‚Äôt matter anyway because I made too much to qualify for something like that anyway.  It didn‚Äôt help at all of my income was passive, which excluded me from any retirement funds anyway.  I‚Äôm not financially in trouble at all, but I do know that post retirement. There are a lot of unforeseen circumstances that will cause you to need more money than you think.  When I read what advisors write about your needs in retirement ‚Äî I am shocked that they lowball it very much.  Unless you die within 10 years of retirement, 1 million in retirement funds is not going to keep you going very long.  Granted I live in an HCOL, but I would say easily three to $5 million is more appropriate.  And I have seen inflation a whole lot worse than we had in the last couple of years ‚Äî and no advisor. Seems to realize that that could happen.  For instance, inflation in the 70s made our recent inflation look like a joke.  And yes, this could happen again.  I‚Äôm just trying to cover for that and other circumstances that would need a lot of money.   Once you‚Äôre out of the workforce, you‚Äôre stuck with whatever you‚Äôve put aside. Investing it is a very slow process, regardless of how high your yields are.  The high Fed rate has helped people like me ‚Äî older ‚Äî raise their cash flow.  It‚Äôs ironic because during my lifetime. ‚Äî before the year 2000, rates were always high and no one had a problem with it.  Personally, I think this near zero policy of federal lending is just causing more problems than it fixes.  it causes people to overspend, to borrow more than they can afford, and to save nothing. It also allows our elected officials to rapidly increase the federal debt because the interest on the debt is very low.  your recommendations of things to purchase with my cash sound interesting.  I‚Äôm not familiar with them so I‚Äôll have to look up what they actually are. Thanks.","I use my Fidelity account to buy Treasuries.

investing,Jul,1dz5thj,In what way does investing in stocks benefit the underlying business?,"I do not yet understand a lot of the stock market. But I was wondering in what sense it benefits a business or a company if I hold or buy stocks of that company? The question comes from moral considerations. Most of the profitable companies out there do shady business. With shady I don't mean illegal business, but business that does harm to people in order to generate profit.      From my own thinking I would argue that it doesn't really affect the business because the stock value doesn't really change the profit a company generates from selling services or goods. But I might be wrong on this.","buying shares of a company increases demand for said shares and pushes the share prices higher, benefiting:  1.

When they make the acquisition offer, it can either be fixed or floating price. Meaning let's say you are XYZ corp and you want to buy ABC for $100, and your shares are worth $10.  Fixed would be ""we are buying ABC for 10 of our shares, at an acquisition price of $100"". When the deal closes ABC gets 10 shares regardless of the price. It could also be ""we are buying ABC for $100 worth of shares, however many that is at closing"" meaning if the price fell to $5 you would need to issue 20 shares (20x5 = 100) or if it doubled, issue 5 shares (5 x 20 = 100).

investing,Jul,1ea63x8,Small cap vs Large cap debate,"Just sharing some thoughts and would love to hear yours about it.   I find it pretty ironic listening to all these experts on bloomberg bashing the small cap trade because it isnt based on fundamentals. I agree !  But what these experts did during the past 2 years? They bought the AI story and stocks with P/E above 40 for and some with higher P/E. I understand the fundamentals logic, but isn‚Äôt quite the same, were buying small caps because we anticipate a better outlook, just like you are buying 40 and above P/E stocks because you believe in this AI trade.","I think the path of corporations is following the same path as individuals: wealth concentration and a thinning of the middle class. Those small cap stocks are the middle class, and they've been increasingly squeezed over the decades by ever more powerful large caps. I don't see how small caps ever meaningfully compete in this global market vs the big players. There will always be wins to be found, of course--but most of those wins are going to be in the form of acquisition by a larger cap! I'm all in on big caps.","A few things worth considering:  1. From a valuation standpoint, the dominance and safety of large caps is heavily priced in, with large caps trading at a huge premium to book value and much higher price to earnings multiples.  2. One of the ways that large caps continue their growth and stay dominant is by acquiring small caps. This can create solid returns for owners of small caps, who see their shares acquired at a premium to market value.   3. A lot of leaders in their industry, especially more niche ones, are still considered small cap. If you look at megacaps, they're mostly tech companies, pharmaceutical companies, and financial.   4. Quite often, large corporations fail to make investments in their product. The best example I can think of is Ametek. They're a $40 Billion megacap that owns a ton of businesses, but the catch is they don't invest their profits in innovation. They cut expenses to the minimum and use all of their cash flow to acquire new businesses, pay a dividend, and buy back shares. This lack of investment creates opportunities for small caps to compete and gain market share.","Yeah, recency bias could be a thing, but pre-1990 was a pre-computer revolution world and companies scaled differently. You can be bearish on large us companies if you want, but I believe they will be dominating and the only thing in the way is government anti-trust regulation","I think the other factor here is inflation is making a lot of the past performance of small/medium/large caps irrelevant that says that small caps will tend to outperform large caps.  Point being, the definitions of a small, mid, and large cap haven't been adjusted for inflation for many decades. In the past the largest large caps in the world were well under $100 billion dollars in market cap, so the $10 billion market cap to be considered a large cap was a very big hurdle. And the $2 billion maximum market cap of small cap stocks was a pretty meaningful amount of buying power and money.  But today when we have multiple stocks worth several trillion dollars, a $10 billion dollar threshold to be considered a large cap is basically a joke. We've had several meme stocks with zero fundamentals, no viable path to profitability, and sometimes even zero revenue, manage to surpass that $10 billion dollar threshold just on pure hype alone. It should not be that easy to qualify as a large cap stock.  And $2 billion for small caps is even more of a problem. Any small cap stock that's worth investing in won't stay under that $2 billion dollar threshold for very long, unless they operate in a very small market where the TAM (Total Addressable Market) won't let them grow enough to be able to justify a higher market cap.   Worse yet, $2 billion dollars from like 50+ years ago has over $10 billion dollars worth of buying power today, meaning that small and mid caps from the past would be considered large cap stocks today, and microcaps from the past are today's small and mid cap stocks.","I believe that large cap US stocks will continue to dominate in the age of AI. These companies have tons of resources that let them invest in AI R&amp;D, GPUs, and AI Cloud Compute Data Centers. They will get a hefty head start because of this and it will carry them for a long time.  They will profit from the automation of labor, efficiencies gained by AI, and selling to smaller cap companies.  Investing in large cap stocks was more profitable even before the age of AI.   If you took the simple strategy of evenly investing in the top 5 companies by market cap each year and never selling, you would have outperformed the S&amp;P500 significantly since 1990.     **Example:**   Person A invested 20k per year in the S&amp;P500 since 1990. Result in 2024: $3,430,111  Person B invested 20k per year, each year, evenly across the top 5 companies by market cap and never sells. (4k into each per year) Result in 2024: $4,436,068     This Youtuber Finxter backtests this strategy here: [https://youtu.be/1c4eCkY2g5s?si=35UBwHvb-Oyk7D5E](https://youtu.be/1c4eCkY2g5s?si=35UBwHvb-Oyk7D5E)",Go further back than 1990 and this looks wildly different,"OP doesn't want to skip the debate, so what's the point of adding this comment?","Small caps will be absolutely fine. The issue is we have been through a period where investors have been conditioned to not think and simply hand their money to iShares/Vanguard to buy large cap indexes. And this is a self-fulfilling prophecy... until a point, when large caps have become so horrendously overvalued that people start to pull back. Admittedly, small caps in the US are not particularly good value either, this is because of international investors using the US indexes too. If you want to see some actual value, you'd need to look elsewhere",Stupid people still comparing digital age with railways :) üòÉ,"Yes, but the world is rather different now to 1990, isn't it? Computers, the internet, smartphones, AI. A truly global market. China, India, Indonesia, Africa, South America. These things all enable massive amounts of growth but require ever increasing amounts of capital and resources. Things are never going back to 1990."

Any guidance on what I should do - keep my current 401k with my current company? Or move it to the new company? I don't know the investment options I'll have with new company. I do know new company matches 1:1 up to 3% and 50 cents on the next 3%. Current company matches 1:1 up to 7.5%.",Who wants to keep track of old 401k plans? Unless your new plan is terrible I would roll it over,"You have three options:  1. Leave it in the current 401K. Do this if you like the investment options/fees better than your new company options/fees.  2. Move it to the new company's 401K program. Do this if the new company has better investment options/fees than your current 401K.  3. Roll it into a ""Rollover IRA"" - just like it sounds. Set up an IRA (or use an existing one) and arrange for transfer of the funds into an IRA where you can choose the investment company and investment options.   I've done both #1 and #3. I have a former company 401K that has absurdly low fees for the various funds and good investment options, so I've kept it. My natural inclination is to suggest #3 since it gives you the most control over your investments.

Good luck with whatever you decide.","I‚Äôm going to be contrary here.  Roll the 401k into your new employer‚Äôs 401k.  Don‚Äôt roll it into an IRA.  By not having an IRA, you can then do a backdoor Roth every year with no taxes.  Backdoor Roths get a tax proration based on how much you have in a traditional IRA.

City would definitely be hard to make autonomous.  Im not sure how well the cameras on the tractor could judge the position of the back of the trailer when turning or backing.  Then you have to remember the massive driver shortage so autonomous vehicles will start by filling those empty positions and could be a decade before they start costing people their jobs.

Etc. you can build an entire portfolio just on that. As a CDL driver I feel only over the road drivers will be replaced. Local municipality and developers will still need drivers/operators for emergency and off the grid applications.  For example after a natural disaster equipment will be needed to clear a main drainage system blocked by down trees and flooding nearby making access throughout all right of ways impossible.

Risks include bond defaults (should the economy sour and some of the corporate bonds held in the fund default -- that is an issue in that corporate bonds may be more correlated to stocks because of this). You also need to understand duration (very important) when buying bonds/ bond funds and the relationship to interest rate risks.  &gt;&gt; Also, is bnd expected to go down in value over the next few years as interest rates go down?  For BND, the value would probably rise as rates drop in the next few years as it has a 6 year duration (the bonds it holds will continue to pay higher rates even if current rates drop making the fund worth more). A bond fund with 3 month duration would see it's price follow rates down. A bond fund with a 20 year duration would rise in value more so then BND; but things get riskier when you buy such long duration bonds. Note that if rates rise, the fund price drops.

This low risk is baked into the yield though, and other bonds (like corporate bonds) will have higher yields because they *must* offer a greater return to compensate for being less secure than the US government. You **definitely** want to hold US Treasuries and may or may not also want to hold other bonds.  It may seem counterintuitive, but the higher volatility of longer-term bonds is actually beneficial for diversification.

investing,Jul,1ef1kj1,What are riskier investments?,"I'm 27. I see people often saying I can ""afford to take on some risk"" at my age. What are they referring to when they say this? S&amp;P as opposed to treasury bonds? or smaller industry-specific ETFs as opposed to the S&amp;P? or individual stocks? How risky are we talking?  Where can I introduce some risk in my portfolio?","I would classify this as ""Very high risk""","Investing in equities with broad exposure has a volatility risk, meaning that short term it's less predictable and at any given time when you might need the money there's a chance your return won't have been worthwhile. This kind of risk can be mitigated with more time invested and transitioning to low or no volatility assets well before you might need the money. When people talk about risk relative to age it's a stand in for how many decades you'll be invested based on the assumption we're talking specifically about savings for retirement. If that's the case, more risk just means a larger proportion of investments in equities vs fixed income like bonds, treasuries, or something like a HYSA.  A lot of new investors confuse this with meaning more volatility is always better and try to apply it to the specific allocation within equities. The difference is that when you get into narrower chunks of the market the outcome is less predictable so the increase in volatility doesn't necessarily mean a proportionally greater expect return, and it means a wider range of outcomes, so there may be a possibility of a higher return, but that comes at the cost of a lower probability of a decent return.  Essentially, if someone says you can afford to take more risk at a young age and suggests a highly concentrated or reckless portfolio, what they mean is you have enough time to lose a lot and start over. What ""afford more risk"" should mean is that you won't need the money for long enough that equities are essentially guaranteed to have a higher return than risk free investments because you can choose when to get out and lock in the current return.","High risk would be some individual small cap stocks,   newer cryptos, shorting stocks, anything with leverage, businesses startups.","Goverment issued bonds have literally 0 risk for most investors, and that money is protected.  S&amp;P500 index funds are very low risk  of losing money when you hold them for 10 years +. Id say there is 0 risk but some people don't like it when I say that.  Etfs and mutual funds vary in risk depending on what the fund is investing in, a bond fund will have low risk and a stock fund will have higher risks, but still lower than individual stocks because they are diversified.  Individual stocks are very risky on the short term, chances of losing money on short term are high. On the long term, if you do your research, stocks can be low risks to medium risk, depending ot the tyoe of stock.  Options is where the risky plays are at. You can lose 100% of your investment in a few days if you have no idea what you are doing. Even when having good knowledge about options, you still can lose most of your investment. I do not recommend options to anyone.",I find it a pretty bad explanation of something i agree with mostly,"When you look up stocks look at the ""Beta."" This is a volatility measurement. The S&amp;P 500 has a Beta of 1. A riskier ETF like SOXX has a beta of 1.24. An extremely volatile stock like MSTR has a beta of 3.09.  A stable, blue chip company like KO has a beta under 1, theirs is 0.59. So if you are looking for higher risk, look for a beta over 1.","There is a perverse notion that risk is correlated to potential return. This is not the case. If you're bearing obvious risk you tend to get some kind of premium but that's not always the case. For example, speculative assets with no actual cash flow or value (like crypto) are based purely on supply and demand which is essentially random but you don't get any sort of compensation for this exposure to randomness.   But you don't really discuss how you're currently allocating capital. For example if you were heavily in cash right now it's probably not great.","Smaller has nothing to do with it.there are small ETFs that are very stable, and large ETFs that are risky.  My holdings are long term, yes. Years or decades.","I think ‚Äúrisk‚Äù in this regard is relative. If you‚Äôre talking to just an ETF investor then ‚Äúrisky‚Äù comparatively would be taking VUG over VOO, or taking VOO over VTI or VT. Apply this concept to any strategy and I think you‚Äôll find your answer.","Beta is a method of measuring the average level of volatility in a security compared to the S&amp;P.  The way it works: the S&amp;P has a beta of 1.  If you invest in a stock with a beta of 2, you‚Äôre expecting the performance of this security to be in the BALLPARK of moving twice is much as the S&amp;P.  What this means is that if the S&amp;P has a +5% year, stocks with beta of 2 (assuming no extreme or industry-specific events happen) that stock will move somewhere in the ballpark of +10%.  Now if the S&amp;P has a bad year and does -5%, you‚Äôre gonna be expecting your security to lose about -10%.       It‚Äôs no golden rule or perfect science, it‚Äôs more of an estimating risk and volatility kind of thing."

Analysts are saying these levels won't last long. Bloomberg is constantly interviewing fund managers that are saying this is a momentary hiatus from large caps and nothing more. Fundamentally I'm not so convinced, I can't help but to be contrarian and wonder if this is just typical big money talk in hopes of swaying market outcomes. I want to know what you guys think.

I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't say for sure if the rally will continue.

And for the one's that do they have an average P/E ratio of 29x which is much higher than the S&amp;P 500. Go look at the valuations of the top 10 holdings, basically all of them have very high P/E ... so it's inaccurate to say small caps have ""very reasonable valuations overall""...  There is a huge range of quality in small cap companies, with many of them being terrible businesses and biotech cash burners that wont exist in 20 years. But there's also plenty of high quality, high growth small caps that will eventually be successful enough to join the S&amp;P 500.  So if you aren't a successful stock picker and can't see the divergence in quality between Super Micro Computer and MicroStrategy, then small caps are likely a bad investment for you... I haven't looked into it enough but looks like the S&amp;P 600 Small Cap Value ETF is the better index vehicle which cuts out many lower quality companies vs IWM (Russell 2000)..","Sustainable?  Sure -- small caps have very reasonable valuations overall.  Will it be sustained?  I have no clue.  But I do believe generally in long term mean reversion of equity asset classes toward their historical returns (though I will admit non-US equities are testing that patience), and small caps have underperformed for over a decade until the last few days (really, everything except US large caps have underperformed).   I do remember the first few years after the ldotcom bubble popped.  When the recovery began in 2002, small caps and international (especially emerging) killed US large caps for most of the decade.  Feels like ancient history now, but...","I‚Äôve made some gains, though id say most of my exposure is thru ETFs like AVUV.  I think the valuations on most of the large caps make them very difficult propositions for investment right now.  That, coupled with ‚Äúcertainty‚Äù of rate cuts starting, has made a nice storm.  I think if everything keeps going to plan in terms of inflation numbers, we will see small cap keep playing catch up.  I think the pace right now is a little crazy, but that money has to go somewhere and there is a lot of volatility with tech right now.","There is a huge valuation discrepancy based on size / liquidity, value vs. growth, quality (which correlates with value), degree of correlation with the economy.

investing,Jul,1eac2n8,Selling of 401k Stock vs Vested stock,"Question for the collective. My company (a fortune 10) offers a 401k which I've been invested in for well over 15 years, in that 401k they are heavily invested well... in themselves.. They also provide stock as part of your bonus each year, so as a result I have a bunch of stock in the 401k and a bunch of stock in my normal portfolio.     I'm over invested and continue to find ways to diversify.  Stock is at an all time high and is continuing to climb.     Speaking with my financial advisor on possible areas to spread out, he recommended liquidating just the company stock out of my 401k and into another fund we've been discussing over the past few months.  That said, I still have a lot of fully vested stock in my personal stock portfolio from years of bonuses. About 9 months ago, I sold off a lot of my ""Long Held"" (vs short) company stock. But i still have triple the long held stock (in value) in my portfolio vs my 401k.  So my question is (not that i doubt my advisor he's done very well for me) is it better to sell off whats in the 401k and roll it into another fund (which from what i read doesnt take a tax hit but i could be wrong) or should i liquidate more of my long held stock in my portfolio and take the capital gains hit.  In my mind it seems like its a wash except the outcome is more diversification either way I choose.","&gt;¬†in that 401k they are heavily invested well... in themselves..     you, not they. its your 401k.     &gt;So my question is (not that i doubt my advisor he's done very well for me) is it better to sell off whats in the 401k and roll it into another fund (which from what i read doesnt take a tax hit but i could be wrong) or should i liquidate more of my long held stock in my portfolio and take the capital gains hit.     both.","Sell whats in the 401k.  As for whats in your portfolio, I'd be careful about capital gains. I don't know how much you have or your income, but be aware of these  long term capital gains rates:  $47,026 to $518,900 - 15%  $518900+ - 20%  Also, the 3.8% NIIT tax for investment income that applies to income over $200,000.  So its possible it could be good to sell limited amounts each year to avoid paying a higher long term capital gains rate.","What kind of shitty reasoning is this. Enron, really? I've got a hundred other examples of companies whose employees got rich as hell by being invested them. Being on the inside at your own company is the best possible way to make more accurate decisions about whether or not to invest in it. If you know your company is doing well, you'd be an idiot to refuse to invest in it, and the opposite holds true as well.   Diversify, yes. VOO and chill, yes. But refusing to invest in a bet that you know is good, simply because they sign your paycheck, is absolutely bonkers.","Don't invest in your own company's stock, that's how all those people who worked at Enron got fucked over.   Your primary income stream is from your job, you're heavily invested in them without owning stock.","\&gt; Enron got fucked over.  OK, so here's the plan.  If you feel like the company is about to go under.  Get a stripper pregnant to force your wife to divorce you, which then forces a judge to order the sale of all your company stock to settle the divorce.   That way you can exit the position at the best time and not get slapped with insider trading charges.","It's not one or the other. In the 401k there's no impact on your taxes unless you withdraw money, you can move it around to different assets within the account as much as you want. In your taxable brokerage you'll have to pay tax on gains eventually no matter what so the only way to reduce that would be if the value drops or if your income drops significantly enough to lower your long term capital gains rate. Unless you make over $500k, your income would have to be below $45k to lower your ltcgr.  The only real question is how much do you want the performance of this one company to be able to impact your savings. Since you can't predict the future, the safe answer is as little as is practical. Get rid of it in the 401k, get rid of all the long term shares in your taxable brokerage, for the short term shares and future pay in the form of shares it depends if the difference between your income tax bracket and capital gains rate is worth the risk of waiting. In other words, if you're in the 22% income bracket how likely is it there'd be a 7% drop in the stock over any given 1 year period.","Start with your 401K. You don‚Äôt pay capital gains tax in your 401K, so there is no tax disadvantage to selling and diversifying in your 401K, even if you have large gains.  Then if you want to diversify further, you can continue selling some from your normal brokerage account. You already alluded to choosing specific lots so I assume you know this, but be sure to also choose the lots with the smallest long-term capital gains to minimize your tax bill. Or short-term lots if they have close to 0 or negative short-term gains.","Let me know where to send payment.  You're right. I probably shouldn't have worded it being one or the other. It was more of a ""does it make sense to move it into something different already in the 401k AND i started selling off stock last year because i was too over invested AND I'll continue to do that"".   I suppose i was also looking at it from the percentage rate of the capital gains tax and not so much what i should be, too over invested take the hit and spread out.","If your company stock is highy appreciated, there may be tax advantages to continue to hold it. This is called Net Unrealized Appreciation and allows employees to income tax on the cost basis of the stock and long term capital gains on the earnings.

I have multiple accounts (IRA, 401K, Investment, banking) so I have a 'watchlist' created for each of my accounts in Morningstar's older Portfolio tool (they are re-writing that as ""Investor"" but I prefer the older tool). When defining a new portfolio (in the older tool), I combine the multiple watchlists (the older tool supports combining watchlists) to define an aggregated portfolio. So, I combine them into one single portfolio (each month or quarterly) and use the X-Ray features on the aggregated portfolio. The process of building a portfolio that way copies the watchlists so any subsequent changes in the watchlists (list of securities, etc.) are not reflected in the combined portfolio (it's a snapshot in time).  Basically, a unique watchlist is maintained for each of my accounts which I aggregate quarterly into a single portfolio which I then look at with x-Ray to see everything together.

You can see the income:  **Turnover**: 33 million  **Cost of sales**: 28 million  **Administrative expenses**: 19 million  **Total EBITDA**: -7 million     I struggle to understand how it's posible to lose that amount of money.  They sell the electricity at 0.85kwh. They probably pay around 0.3kwh for that electricity.  They should have a 50% profit margin before applying administrative expenses, depreciation and other expenses.  Why are they burning that amount of money? How it's posible?","Just speculating, but I'm an EV owner in the UK and I strongly suspect many of these charging companies are going to mismanage themselves into bankruptcy.   Many brands are very fiddly and temperamental, needing lots of faffing to get the charge started, and you to call a helpline and request manual resets. They break down frequently requiring an expensive electrician and all the associated callout fees and loss of revenue (It's ironic that my Tesla will travel tens of thousands of miles without needing a service, yet the charger with no moving parts needs repaired eight times a week).   And then there's the cost. They were a little too cheap before Ukraine, now they've gone to comedy levels of overpricing. 85p per kWh is 12x what I pay at home. I'll simply never use a charger that expensive. It's much more than a Tesla supercharger yet half the speed. Why would I ever use that service?  That's a scam you can only really pull on people once - you might get the occasional sucker that doesn't check the tariff, or emergency, but generally you'll drive away the vast majority of your customers. You expect *some* premium on convenient locations (eg petrol might be 10% more expensive at motorway service stations, but not 1,200% more).   I strongly suspect these guys have developed hardware that's too unreliable to turn a profit, and now they've entered a death spiral by putting their prices up to try and cover their unsustainable costs.   Just anecdotally, there's a fast charger on my road that I used to use for convenience when it was only a little more expensive than my home charger, it was fairly popular. Now they've put it up to 60p per kWh and I've not seen a single car there in months.","I'm just guessing here, but if they are borrowing and expanding, does that eat into EBITA?",You do realize that a kwh is an amount of energy not a payment amount?,I think this is it.  They likely are expanding massively and those expenses were why they were able to show a loss.,"I'm not talking about interest.  I'm talking about new borrowing and even if not that, spending on expansion.","You're missing the nuance.   My point is people were using them routinely when they were only marginally more expensive than domestic rates. They made sense as a premium product - faster chargers in good locations that cost a little more. So these businesses broke even on the basis of frequent use and steady revenue (which is important for a product with high fixed and marginal costs like these).   Now the price of these chargers has gone up \~500% whilst home charging prices haven't changed. And some public chargers are still free. *That's* the problem. There's now a huge spread in prices, and people have choice. That's why cost vs ICE isn't relevant - because EV owners compare different chargers, not one charger versus hypothetical ICE costs.   Even if the most expensive charger is still cheaper than ICE, EV owners will still seek the cheapest charger.   That's why these guys are in trouble. They're offering a wildly expensive, slower product in a competitive market.","Just seems like the worst business. Mostly cause you're competing against Tesla which comparatively has unlimited money and doesn't have to make a profit strictly on EV chargers, but yet has every incentive to provide the best charging experience possible because they only sell electric cars. Also, it's very hardware intensive and the return on capital is probably pretty slow. Basically the margin on EV chargers could trend to 0 and Tesla wouldn't even care...",My god is electricity really .3 pounds  per kwh retail in the UK?,No - I mean new charging stations.,"The question of cost of the electrical energy at a charging location vs. at a residence, an employer, or hotel, etc. is not the issue here.  Folks are only going to use these locations when they absolutely have to (e.g., on a road trip), and any comparison in cost has to be vs. an ICE engine - and the baseline cost of mobility using electrical power as sourced from, e.g., a residence, is such a fraction of the cost of mobility via ICE that even with the high multiples of cost, it probably still makes economic sense, and certainly it's not a problem for folks that use these charging locations infrequently."

So now I have 100 shares valued at $150 each.  If the stock market crashes tomorrow and it drops to $115, then I still would have purchased most of the stock below $115.  So even if the stock market crashes, then I'm still covered and it will eventually go back up, but if it doesn't drop, then even better.  25 years ago, I used to pick out individual stocks and analyze all of the details.

I use a fee-free beoker,"Transferring in and out¬†of SGOV will complicate doing taxes slightly with the capital gains and losses.

Any thoughts or suggestions?","Whatever you end up doing my dude, don‚Äôt gamble it. What a lot of people who are getting older and didn‚Äôt save do is they make these really risky investments hoping they‚Äôll hit it big, then they lose what they invested.

investing,Jul,1e1igbw,Which bank would you recommend to open a HYSA? ,"Does the choice of bank matter when opening a high-yield savings account, or should we only be concerned with the interest rate? Are there other factors to consider, such as fees, account accessibility, customer service, and the bank's reputation? How do these elements impact our decision?",Charles Schwab. You can pull out money from any ATM on the planet for free. You leave your money in a money market fund and transfer it to your checking when you want to pull it out or pay bills. They usually have deals if you open an account too. They have me $500 for opening one with them.,Caveat to this is a money market fund trades like a mutual fund. You need to wait till the next business day to access the cash. Not a big deal but it should be noted you don‚Äôt have immediate access like you would in an HYSA.,Take a look at nerdwallet.com for HYSA recommendations,"Also worth mentioning they don't hold any insurance like bank accounts do with fdic. They're still very low risk, and have only broken the buck twice once in '94 and again in '08 but additional regulations on MMFs were passed after Lehman brothers bankruptcy in 2008 to make them safer.  Personally, I think it's worthwhile rather than dealing with games that many HYSA providers play to cheat you out of an actual ""high"" savings rate","I looked into this recently and settled on a Fidelity brokerage account which can be used similarly to a HYSA. It has a ""core position"" money market fund that your balance is automatically put into and automatically withdrawn from when you move money. There are also unlimited transfers in and out and the ability to get a debit card, so the brokerage account can be used like a high yield checking account. The core position SPAXX is yielding \~5% right now.   My next choices and the reason for them were:  - Amex. 4.25% is great but not as competitive as the 5% offered by other banks right now. Amex has good customer service though and is the least likely imo to result in me suddenly not having access to my money  - Marcus by Goldman Sachs. High yield by an established bank. I've seen some rumors online though about Goldman Sachs planning on shutting down their HYSA offering so I'd be anxious about that possibility and the potential difficulty it could pose as people rush to get their money out  - Wealthfront. High yield and great UX but too many horror stories on Reddit about people getting their account locked for seemingly no reason and having way too hard of a time getting hold of support. Similarly, since Wealthfront itself isn't a bank, if they go down then utilizing the FDIC insurance is trickier because the underlying bank that holds your money hasn't actually failed. Look into what happened with Yotta  - SoFi. Similar to Wealthfront though SoFi is itself a bank. Lots of similar stories online about accounts getting frozen and trouble getting in touch with support  Keep in mind that savings accounts used to have a limit on the number of transfers per month but the federal law underpinning that has changed so many banks removed the limits as well. Some like Ally still have them, but for all of the above, there is no limit so you can get the high APY while still using the account for things like auto bill payment.  I called Amex and Fidelity numerous times while setting up my accounts and transferring money. Each time I was quickly able to get in touch with someone who knew what they were talking about and were helpful. YMMV with the others. Consider that it's not just the highest APY you want, it's the highest APY + confidence your account is safe + ability to talk to CS when you need to (or at least for me it is).","Personally I wouldn't recommend a bank, I would open a brokerage and deposit the money into a money market mutual fund or a short term bond fund if state taxes are an issue  Just note it might take 2 days to access the cash if you need (one day to sell , one day to transfer) but usually that is enough liquidity for emergency savings",Wealthfront currently offers 5.00% APY,"The only bad part is since Wealthfront isn't actually a bank, you might be screwed temporarily if Wealthfront goes under (or hacked, etc).  More plausible with the recent Yotta / Evolve Bank stuff and the FDIC won't step in since the money isn't gone, people just can't get it.  That situation has given pause to putting money in FinTech that forwards your money to banks.","SoFi for a couple of reasons  1) They are an actual bank themselves, no weird fintech sweeps to a partner bank  2) They have unlimited transactions on the savings account and free unlimited overdrafts from savings, which means you can effectively pile your savings and checking into one high interest pile, leave your checking balance at $0, and bank entirely out of your savings account.  3) It has vaults if you want to use the setup from #2, but still want to protect some of your savings from normal access.  4) You can also do your investing for normal taxable or retirement accounts in the same app.  5) Very fast bank transfers   There are some other nice minor benefits and the app is pretty solid too. I also want to state the downsides:  1) Customer service is not great most of the time, especially on chat. They can help with basic things, but anything more can be a pain.  2) Limited cash deposits, and you have to do them through cashiers at stores like Walgreens.  3) You can‚Äôt send outgoing wires for anything other than a home purchase  4) You can‚Äôt link an external account that doesn‚Äôt support Plaid  5) You‚Äôll need direct deposit to activate the high savings rate","&gt; The only bad part is since Wealthfront isn't actually a bank, you might be screwed temporarily if Wealthfront goes under (or hacked, etc).  Very important reminder, that Wealthfront is a Fintech that interfaces with actual banks. The reason they provide ""millions of FDIC"" is that in theory they can spread your money through multiple bank accounts automatically... I also don't know how you would verify that your money is even spread through multiple banks correctly since there are so many layers of tech/abstractions between you and when your money is FDIC insured.  The issue is that if something happens with the Fintech company and they fuck up, while your money is TECHNICALLY in a bank and FDIC insured you may not have very obvious recourse on how to get your money. A fintech screwup is technically not a bank failure and therefore not an FDIC event. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/synapse-fintech-fdic-false-promise.html)  I'm extremely skeptical of Fintech in general. Banks should be simple as fuck. I put money in, and it goes directly to the bank. No middlemen trying to distribute, ETC."
investing,Jul,1e5ubmt,How should I go about investing into my Roth IRA account,"I am 20 years old and just opened a Roth IRA account with Fidelity. I recently enrolled in Walmart's 401k plan, which matches 6% of the amount I contribute. Additionally, I plan to invest $272.60 into my Roth IRA account every month and would like to diversify this investment. I have been looking at FSELX, FSMDX, FSKAX, FZROX, and FZILX and would like to know which ones should be prioritized. I am open to other recommendations as well. My goal is to grow my money in a relatively conservative manner through regular monthly contributions. I do not plan on contributing more unless my income increases. I prioritize growing my money with minimal risk and am willing to put in the effort to research and learn. Please provide any links or detailed advice that could help with my investment decisions. Thank you!","FXAIX is what you want, trying to minimize risk at 20 years old will cost you a fortune by the time you reach retirement.   I'm not saying do anything reckless but you need to take on some risk, especially at such a young age.","First of, congratulation on being a 20 year old thinking long term and already making use of a 401K. Now we need to personalize your investments to match your retirement horizon. If you are planning on working into your 50s or 60s, that gives you 30 to 40 years to invest and watch your money compound and grow. This also means you can ""accept"" a lot more risk now, and de-risk your portfolio once you are 5 to 10 years from retirement.  Typically, someone your age could have a portfolio heavily weighted into the SP500 (80%) and the remaining 20% could be distributed between small/mid-cap stocks, such as those in the Russell 2000, international stocks and even corporate bonds. Fidelity offers plenty of options for all the above.  If you want to keep things super simple, then a Total Market index fund, such as FSKAX, which contains over 3,800 US stocks, is the way to go AND is already weighted. If you compare the historical performance of the SP500 vs Total Stock Market funds, they are nearly identical.  **Extra Nugget**: instead of defining a dollar amount to invest in the Roth IRA, give yourself a target to save a certain percentage % of your paycheck, AND as you get promotions and raises throughout your career, continue to increase that percentage %. A 15% savings rate is a fantastic place to start.  Good luck to you!  JosephTalksMoney",FXAIX is what I use as well and I‚Äôm not much older than OP.

It likely matches 100% of what you contribute, up to 6% of your salary.  That should be priority #1 because it's free money.  There's more answers to ""what to invest in"" than there are people in the world.  But of those, FZROX or FZKAX sounds like a good baseline.  If it were me, 100% into one of those for a couple years before worrying about narrower funds, to just sort of anchor your portfolio to what markets do in general.  Then once you have that, you can worry about trying to increase return.

investing,Jul,1e2mcag,A robo advised IRA vs just SPY/VOO?,"I currently have my IRA via Schwab Intelligent portfolios. I really like that I can just fund it and never worry about it.   Question: what are the benefits / drawbacks of having a robo advised IRA vs just contributing to an S&amp;P500 index and forgetting about it?  The intelligent portfolios acct has ~70% stocks and the rest a mix of fixed income, bonds, and cash. But would I be better off just putting it all in VOO/SPY?","Surprised the most important thing hasn't been mentioned yet.  One of the main benefits of robo-advisors is automated tax-loss harvesting (in fact, I'd say this is the only real value-add they provide).  You can't do that in an IRA, so the benefit is completely gone.  Either way you're committing to some mix of stocks/bonds/other assets, IMO you're best off spending some time figuring that out, ditching the robo-advisor, and then setting an annual calendar reminder to rebalance yourself.  As general advice, if you're young and this is retirement money (i.e. 30+ year investment window), going 100% equities is fine.","I wouldn't use either a robo-advisor or S&amp;P 500 (alone) in an IRA.     Low cost target date index funds exist, they're often cheaper than robo-advisors.  S&amp;P 500 means ignoring about half the market (US extended and everything outside the US), I've not seen good reason to do that. Long term has tended to favor smaller caps, and going global can both help increase returns and reduce volatility.","Not being 100% stocks means that you expect that if we are going to have a period of distrust towards growth, the rebound on exit might be later than when you need money, making equity risk more important to hedge against. It's less important on a longer horizon for obvious reasons.",It seems silly to have those &lt;3% funds when they‚Äôre already accounted for in VTI. Personally I also think it‚Äôs silly that it‚Äôd invest so much in International stock,"So would a target-date fund, and with lower fees.  The only place a robo-advisor really makes sense is in a regular taxable account, where you can let it handle tax-loss harvesting for you.",Interesting analysis that I hadn't thought of but I take issue with your last point: VOO is the vanguard fund,"It's trading away some return for lower volatility.  There's lots of wrong answers but there isn't really a *right* answer.    In terms of long term returns, all in VOO probably outperforms.  But it'll be a bumpier ride.",Target date into a low cost reputable fund is the best advice in the world. Set it and forget it for 40 years then enjoy your well funded retirement.,&gt;It seems silly to have those &lt;3% funds when they‚Äôre already accounted for in VTI  Agreed.  &gt;Personally I also think it‚Äôs silly that it‚Äôd invest so much in International stock   They're within reasonable rounding distance of global market cap weight. US shouldn't have higher expected long term returns than ex-US.  Edit: Caps,"70% stocks seems like a pretty conservative allocation if you're at all young. You won't catch me with an allocation like that until I'm like, 50 or 55.   Aside from that it looks like it just charges you $30/mo to do some pretty basic allocation flowchart stuff. So like, not ideal but honestly not a big deal either way, as long as the actual allocation is good which is a BIG if."

However, recently I‚Äôve wanted to transfer my Robinhood account into Webull. My reasoning is because I like Webull better than robinhood in almost every aspect.

investing,Jul,1e5yf17,Returns with FA have been great but fees relatively high,"My financial advisor (1.5% fee AUM) has handled my IRAs for the last 3-4 years. I joined after Covid because I didn‚Äôt really know anything about investing and had old 401Ks sitting around and not doing anything.   The returns have been great. They‚Äôve well exceeded the SP500. My IRAs are up around 40% over the last year.  A big part of me thinks the returns will eventually regress towards the SP500 and I‚Äôm fearful the 1.5% will play a negative factor later on. Currently I‚Äôm also invested in an ETF with a 0.6 expense ratio so some fees on top of fees.   Pre Covid, they outperformed the SP500 for 5-10 years IIRC so they‚Äôve been performing well for an extended period. However I think anyone invested in tech did well during that time.   I‚Äôm thinking about just investing in low cost index funds that follow the SP500 instead. I‚Äôm 36 years old, married, and we have no debt if that matters.   Any thoughts would be appreciated.","woooowwwwww. One of THOSE FAs.   The positives: You made out like a bandit these past few years. Those gains are all yours! If you listened to someone like me two years ago you'd have a lot less money now.   And that could be true two years from now! The only thing you learn in this industry is that you're always wrong.   And...hey...maybe your FA can time when this momentum trade ends perfectly. That's possible?  The bad: How....could anyone look their client in the eyes and justify this is the best risk-adjusted allocation for your long-term best interests?  You're super concentrated and every part of the allocation is like 100% correlated to the other. Owning QTEC and MTUM and NVIDIA or Meta together does essentially nothing for you.   They're all going to go up at the same time....and they're all going to go down at the same time. There is essentially zero benefit to owning all three and nothing else.    No offense to my man. But if he was a 20 stock superstar tech stock picker...he wouldn't be an FA.   The risks of being so volatile, downside weighted, concentrated AND undiversified are tremendous.   The ONLY way you can win is if the specific market environment of the past short-term continues OR your man can time the market perfectly. Both are possible....but I wouldn't bet on it.  Trying not to bash your guy...it's a tough job....but I can't comprehend a fiduciary putting you in that allocation.

Also not indicative of what's going to outperform going forward, although it very well could! Market's been wild man.  Ultimately comes down to what you're comfortable with.

The rest (maybe 20?) are individual stocks with several of the usual tech suspects.","The fee is definitely on the higher side. I think you have to ask yourself what your FA does for you. Do you have a financial plan with them? Do you call them to ask questions and run different scenarios and how it will impact your plan? Do you envision a scenario in the future where you will need their help/advice, such as estate planning, if you haven‚Äôt done that already? Do they calm your nerves when going through a market correction as opposed to not having them around during a bear market or recession to do so?","&gt; The returns have been great. They‚Äôve well exceeded the SP500.  Cool!  It won't continue like that indefinitely, though.  It never does.  No one on this planet has a secret code that will always beat the market.

I currently have about $44,000 invested with Raymond James. They‚Äôve informed me that my account is a fee-based one with no transaction commissions‚Äîmeaning I don‚Äôt pay extra for buying or selling. Instead, there‚Äôs an annual management fee of 0.50%, which is billed quarterly (0.125% per quarter based on the account balance at each quarter‚Äôs end).  Additionally, investments in ETFs, which constitute my entire portfolio, come with internal fees ranging from 0.15% to 0.4% annually. These are not billed directly but are deducted from the investment returns.  Given this setup, I‚Äôm considering whether I might be better off with a service like Fidelity, known for lower fees. I‚Äôve heard opinions suggesting that Raymond James might be somewhat overpriced. I‚Äôd appreciate your insights.","Fidelity has no commission like all other brokerages.

I manage money for a living and 99.9% of people IMO would be better off doing the above than anything else.","Yes, move to Fidelity and don't look back!",Never trust someone with a first name as a surname. Basically two first names. Historically they are inaccurate people. But then again the AI said that.,He already did. Just do what he said,As far as I know,I don't have any experience with Raymond James but unless you're seeing some benefit from the management they're doing then yes you should move to Fidelity or Vanguard. You can easily set up an ETF based portfolio yourself and pay only the ETF's internal fees which will be very low for fidelity or vanguard ETFs.,They don't.  Worse they have declining glidepaths.  In general what you want is to derisk right before retirement and based on draw or health generally risk up during retirement.  Because a target date fund can't take into account your individual circumstances they derisk for everyone which can increase longevity risk and make sure your legacy is smaller than it should be.

That said it does affect my work performance and while one of my doctors suggests trying to apply for disability anyway I don't see a point as long as I can keep employment that keeps me from touching my savings.  But eventually, it will reach a critical point where age bias (tech) combined with just the fact my health affects job performance to the points it can't really be concealed, I just started with a high enough baseline performance I can stay employed for awhile.

Also, if you need assisted or nursing care, living costs can skyrocket the last few years of your life.   If you make zero returns and withdraw 5%, it'll last 20 years. To make it last another 10 you don't need much.","You understand that dividends are just forced sales, right?","Here's one (of several) portfolios with about 5% perpetual withdrawal rate: https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolios/weird-portfolio/  The charts are worth studying if you're into this stuff. You can also build and backrest your own asset-class portfolios on that website.  Fwiw with a multi-decade retirement, there's an argument that your portfolio doesn't need to look any different than before retirement. (Assuming you believe in diversification. If your investment style is concentrated high risk in single sectors or stocks, probably a different story. Not my style so can't speak much to that one.)  For actual retirement planning, you could also look at more holistic financial projection tools like projectionlabs.com or similar. They can also model social security, withdrawal strategies, house owning vs renting etc to paint a more complete picture.",Enough that if I'm off by 5 years I'll be OK but I don't need the entire principle either.  My estimated life expectancy is 28 years after retirement but it can be longer eh?,"4% rule includes inflation fwiw. You start with 4% withdrawal in the first year, and then adjust the withdrawal amount each year to align with inflation in that year, regardless what the stock market did.","Google the guardrails approach. This is a more recent study by financial wonks and is the method I plan to employ in my future retirement.  In short, if there is a 10% movement in your portfolio, you drop your spending. I know some people don't want to reduce retirement spending but I personally think flexibility leads to resilience.  Also I recomend reading a lot of Kitces stuff, he is a thought leader for HNW clients and is now advising the advisors more and more.

investing,Jul,1e2iijz,I am the beneficiary of a trust. Who should I ask to have manage it?,"I am the beneficiary of a trust with approx. $300,000 that I cannot access for 9 years. The trustee is allowing me input as to how it's managed. I'm no financial expert, and would love so input.   Currently, the trustee, my aunt, is planning on investing the money with the firm she uses for her retirement. Her and her husband are worth quite a bit of money, and pay 2% + a percentage on profit (she didn't say the exact figure).  I'd rather pay a much lower fee, as I'm in a much different situation. I'm not near retirement and can't access the money anyway, so I don't think my money needs to be as tightly managed as hers. Effectively, I see no reason the money can't be thrown into a total market fund + total bond fund + s&amp;p 500 etf or something.   The only issue is there are apparently some tax and liability considerations. The trustee hasn't shared with me any paperwork, so I'm not sure what those may be, but I assume they're some degree of boilerplate. She isn't the most schooled on these thing either but said something about having to pay income tax each year on the trust. I don't really understand that if the money isn't liquid‚Äì at least with my own portfolio I only pay taxes when I withdraw/sell. Does this situation require a trust management company by necessity?  My personal finances are that I grew up at the poverty level, but currently have low debt and professional employment. 26 years old. My brother is 24 with a high paying professional job and identical trust (he'll do with his trust whatever I do, most likely lol) I'll likely be starting graduate professional school next year. Point being, I don't really need to touch this money or screw around with withdrawing early. I would like some access to aid my mother's retirement or pay for graduate school expenses here or there, but nothing crazy, hardly enough to affect my income taxes and I'll survive if I can't.   My preference is to invest somewhat aggressively, in a simple manner, with low fees. I figure if i turn 35 and the market is down, and thus my account, i can just wait a couple years for market recovery. Can we use a robo-advisor + an accountant? Or do we need a full trust service for 1-2% annually? What paperwork should I try to acquire to understand which service is best with respect to the rules of the trust?   Apologies if any of this is off-base or presumption. I'm ignorant on this stuff!","Your aunt‚Äôs ‚ÄúFinancial Firm‚Äù is salivating at the opportunity to fleece you for 2% + a percentage.    Open a trust account with Fidelity and invest it into an S&amp;P500 fund, FXAIX (or similar) - https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/investing-ideas/index-funds  https://www.fidelity.com/open-account/trust-account","I'm gonna go against the grain here, because Reddit is full of antisocial morons.  Do what will make your aunt happy.   Do not make a stink about a fee on a 300k gift. That would be obnoxious as fuck.",If his aunt is giving him 300k in a trust there is actually a good chance with that fee structure said ‚Äúfinancial firm‚Äù is a hedge fund only available to this client via the connection with his aunt. Who given the amount she is giving in the trust to a niece/nephew of all people means she is likely worth well in to the 10‚Äôs of millions herself.  His aunt isn‚Äôt ‚Äútight‚Äù she is playing the game of high risk for extremely outsized reward.,"Well, for starters, you can't move your money to another account for another 9 years.    To change the investments WITHIN the trust will very likely cost ¬´someone¬ª real money.  (Probably your aunt, and she may not like that!) A trust account is non-qualified, so any sales will generate cap gains -- perhaps LOTS of them -- and of course those are taxable to the account owner.  If she chooses to ""bill you"" for that expense ... y'see where this is going?  This will be an unpopular opinion here, but if I were you I'd ignore the whole thing for now.  Let your beloved aunt continue to pay fees -- not you -- and when you actually come in to **ownership** of the money -- not just **limited control** -- then move it around.  Until then, try to view this as ""Not My Problem"".  (Unless you WANT it to be Your Problem, of course.  There might be a way around -part- of that -- a separate account managed by you but of course still OWNED by the trust.)","2% is far more than almost any financial advisors I‚Äôve ever heard of in the past decade or two. That sort of cost basis is inappropriate for pretty much anyone.   You should have it put in Schwab, vanguard or fidelity, and put in whatever investments you think are appropriate based on that. Most people here will recommend putting it in low cost index funds, which have outperformed active managers over a ten year period 95% of the time. There‚Äôs some more advice in this piece:   https://youtu.be/aL6V0arEx_E?si=4koDOaPPEVUSa1TB  There are some arguments about the value of financial advisors, suggesting that they can offer a ~3% greater return than you‚Äôd get on your own. Most of what they bring to the table can be replicated though and a lot is just your not selling when markets go down, which is why most people underperform the markets over the long run (selling when things go down, buying when they go up).   https://ptmwealth.com/articles/vanguard-working-with-an-advisor-can-add-about-3-in-net-returns   There are some benefits, mainly around tax planning, but for people who aren‚Äôt drawing from retirement accounts and investments regularly, and who are mostly in a portfolio of index funds or other comparable things, you just don‚Äôt need to be paying a regular ongoing fee. certainly not thousands a year.",Very true. We need more information on who this financial firm is.,OP won‚Äôt be able to just open a trust because they‚Äôre a beneficiary. The trustee is the one who will manage the trust.,"i now actually agree...... the performance fee is bad though if they aren't doing much.  and hope they aren't generating short-term capital gains without achieving much.  but ultimately, i agree on ""don't make a fuss""",I don‚Äôt actually think you work in the industry Lmaoo. I do. Hedge funds have a wide variety of investments. A lot of them will invest in alternatives as well and some will stick to one strategy. They often focus on not just beating the indexes but providing positive returns when the market is down.  They get more per risk than the S&amp;P gives usually. At least in high quality funds.,It is likely a hedge fund as opposed to a planner.  There would not be a hedge fund industry if their 2 plus 20 fee structure does not give better risk adjusted returns over long periods of time.   Op likely has very little say on who manages the trust. Grandma probably has at least 8 digits.
investing,Jul,1e7mbip,"For the same amount of money, is it better to buy crypto or the ETFs?","BTC or GBTC? ETH or ETHE?  Is there a reason one would be better than another?  It seems like GBTC matches BTC pretty well and similar for ETH and ETHE.  To be clear, BTC is bitcoin and GBTC is a bitcoin ETF.  ETH is Ethereum and ETHE is an Ethereum ETF.  Ignoring the fact that money might not be safe on crypto exchanges, is there any other reason to buy the ETFs instead of the coins?","You don‚Äôt have to keep crypto on exchanges, if you really want to invest in crypto then you get yourself your own wallet. You are in complete control then. The benefits of the etf version is you can hold them in tax advantaged accounts such as an IRA.","I am amazed that there aren't 50 comments saying ""bItCoiN iS a sCaM"". Times are changing blimey",A brokerage account with MFA is much safer for like 99% of people.,"Several have already commented on advantages of ETF and IRAs.  One thing i haven‚Äôt seen mentioned in favor of owning the actual coins is the 24/7 nature of crypto markets. If something big were to happen on a weekend or outside of trading hours, your hands will be tied until the markets open with an ETF.","There are tax advantages to holding the ETFs. That said, not your keys, not your coins‚Ä¶","I would agree, however,  crypto was created to give the owner complete control over their finances without a central entity having control over the holdings, your assets at a bank or brokerage can be frozen, nobody can freeze your own wallet.  Holding crypto with a centralized entity kind of defeats the purpose of it. It depends on your stance","I remember being downvoted and ostracized to oblivion for even mentioning Bitcoin here a few years back. My oh my, how times have changed!","While this is true and worth consideration, for those who want to make some money off it with no intention of actually using crypto the ETFs in a tax sheltered account are going to be more practical.","By holding crypto on your own wallet, you risk losing it due to your own mistakes, bugs in the wallet, physical theft, hacking, etc.  By holding crypto at an exchange, you risk losing it due to your account on the exchange getting hacked, the exchange getting hacked or otherwise going bankrupt (counterparty risk), government action (regulatory risk), etc.  By holding crypto using an ETF, you mainly have multiple forms of counterparty risk (the ETF, the wallet provider used by the ETF) and regulatory risk.  If you just want to invest, and have limited technical knowledge, the ETFs might be the best choice.","Bitcoiners seem to have a surprisingly low understanding of the technicalities of Bitcoin. Perhaps that's key to being a Bitcoiner...  Anyway, learn something about Bitcoin: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21356  Bitcoin will stop in the year 2038. And requires a hard fork to fix it. A hard fork like the type of hard fork required to change the 21M cap. So if Bitcoin can be changed to fix the 2038 bug, it can also be changed to remove the 21M cap. Hope you are willing to make peace with this."
investing,Jul,1dxu3fi,Are REITs worth it? (SCHH),"I‚Äôm considering investing in Charles Schwab‚Äôs REIT (SCHH). I‚Äôve never invested in REITs though, are they worth it? They sound good on paper, but people don‚Äôt really talk about them much. Am I better off just buying an s&amp;p 500 index fund instead?   I‚Äôm currently highly diversified in my 401(k) and Roth IRA, and I‚Äôm investing in SWTSX (Schwab‚Äôs total market index fund), but would adding a REIT be a good idea? Or should I just keep the investing in what I already have?   I‚Äôm also considering investing in one of Schwab‚Äôs ‚Äúthemes‚Äù (just a group of stocks focused around a theme. For example the AI one has a 40% gain in the last year). But I don‚Äôt hear much about that either.   All I hear over and over is ‚Äúbuy the s&amp;p‚Äù but these other investments seem promising. Yet the lack of excitement in the public make me skeptical.   Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks!","I hold some REITs (O, ABR and NNN) in a roth IRA and bought a bit more when they all tanked over the last couple years. I'd avoid the ones with major exposure to CRE, otherwise the rest could be seen as a good opportunity pre-empting rate cuts.   Ultimately you're probably better off just buying index funds but whatever, I like having some dividends in there.",[deleted],&gt;Am I better off just buying an s&amp;p 500 index fund instead?   No one knows.  The reits did better for a while then they didn't.  Small cap value did better for a while then it didn't 1999 was a poor time to get in QQQ but then it did better currently.   I have some vnq and small cap holdings but at this point I usually just go with the s and p.  Though at this point the s and p is basically overwhelming tech but that's the point of buying an index.,Very helpful,"they're ok  they get hyped up often, some are ok, some aren't. look at overall performance not just dividend payout  you don't get many of the advantages of owning real estate outright (e.g leverage, tax benefits, depreciation writeoffs..etc) and this is a big part of what makes real estate attractive  some have requirements that they need to distribute x% of their earnings as payouts to maintain eligibility of being categorized as such  and you should know how their business is sensitive to interest rates, in short the higher the rates the worse their profitability  honestly i think most are neither here nor there in that they don't offer true diversification from the market on the downside but also don't have a particular rhyme or reason on their upside","IMO, not really worth.    They can have similar volatility to an index fund but have hugely underperformed (SCHH 4% annualized total return over the last decade).  Also, the dividends are ordinary, so they'll be taxed as income, not capital gains, unless they're in a retirement account anyway.    They probably stand to gain when rate cuts arrive, but... well, LOTS of things stand to gain when rate cuts arrive.  So I don't think that's a very compelling reason.  I could be wrong, but... Guess what the worst-performing sector of the stock market has been over the last 5 years.  That's right, REITs! Guess the only market sector with negative returns in 2024... Yep, REITs again.  Utilities are generally the most boring part of the stock market, and even those are beating real estate.",After investing in them for last 5 years my recommendation would be no. You are better off with index funds.,"Just keep investing in SWTSX. It takes a lot of time and effort to find the right individual stock.   If you actually like to spend that time and effort, then go for it. But if you are looking for the highest return for the lowest amount of effort, then stick with SWTSX.",SWTSX is already total US stock market (including REITS and S&amp;P 500).  Adding those positions to your portfolio wouldn‚Äôt diversify it; it would weight it.  To diversify you would need to add international position(s).  SWISX is Schwab‚Äôs international mutual fund (developed markets). For an ETF version (since you were looking at SCHH) you have SCHF (developed international markets).,"Funny, the re investors I‚Äôve listened to have said cre is the one area of re that they‚Äôre bullish on.

investing,Jul,1e7xlup,My US visa is running out and will move to canada. Planning to buy an apartment. Should i withdraw my 401k?,Basically as the title says. My visa is running out and i have to move to canada where i will have PR/Green card status. I am hoping to buy an apartment but i dont have enough for a down-payment.   I was considering withdrawing 401k which has about 135k right now so penalty of 13k to 14k. But then i have no more retirement savings anywhere and will basically have to start over in canada and if ever i come back to US then I'll have to start my 401k again  Other option is dont touch it and just let it grow and sleep on my brothers couch for several months while i save up a bit more (obv no more contribution and matching anymore so just the flat 135k will be left to grow). Thinking if i leave it I'll roll it over to a 401k roth?  Is it worth it to cut out my whole retirement savings over the last 5 to 6 years (i know 135k isnt a lot for that amt or time but I'm trying) for an apartment that I will likely sell if i leave canada?,You ain‚Äôt buying a condo in Toronto making only  $5k-$6k a month,"In addition to crashing on couch, what about just renting an apt?",You aren‚Äôt getting approved for a $540k mortgage making $5-6k per month,"There is a US-Canada tax treaty that recognizes retirement plans in the other country.   This could allow pre-tax 401k plans to grow tax deferred until withdrawal.  There are some additional complications like Roth accounts needing to be declared to the CRA after you move by a certain deadline.  There might also be adverse tax consequences if you convert to Roth after moving to Canada.   You‚Äôll want to do some additional research, but moves from the US to Canada are not uncommon, so there is a lot of information out there.  But, if you plan to eventually move to a third country, this can complicate things.   You may find other things like a totalization agreement allowing you to get a partial Social Security benefit without ten years of work in the US.  If you have any taxable investments, Canada may step up cost basis when you move, which can be advantageous if you aren‚Äôt subject to an exit tax in the US.","Good luck but no, you won't. Canada has something called a stress test for mortgages. The banks check to see if you have the income to support a mortgage that's 2% higher than what you'll actually receive.  Rule of thumb is 4X your income is the total mortgage amount. You make 60-70k Cad they'll give you a 240k-280k mortgage maximum. Even with your savings you don't qualify.","&gt;I was considering withdrawing 401k which has about 135k right now so penalty of 13k to 14k.   Nope. Leave it alone. Compounding on 135k now, versus losing 5, 10, 15 years starting over again is 10x harder.  Know from personal experience.   Carl is 30 with $135k and plans to retire at 68. John is 40 with the same amount and plans to retire at 68. They're both going to earn an average 8% return over the years and they are never going to contribute another cent.  Carl retires with $2.5 million. John retires with $1.1 million. Oh heck. Let's look at Sam who is 25 with the same set up.  He retires with $3.7 million.  Time absolutely is the most important thing with regards to compound returns.","Well based on my salary there ive been told I'll get abut 5k to 6k per month  so in order to save 40k id need to save for 6 or so months with no expenses or minimal expenses.  If i rented, even a studio here is about 1.5 to 2k. Its ridiculous the market in toronto.   So id have monthly savings of maybe 3 to 4k. Whoch woll double my time before i can buy","It is, but it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd have to open through your employer. If they‚Äôve already left their job, it won‚Äôt be possible to open one.",You won‚Äôt be paying just the 10% penalty for early withdrawal. You will also be paying taxes on the amount withdrawn based on US/CA law. Basically you‚Äôll get far less than 90% of the balance.   Crash on your brother‚Äôs couch or rent an apartment don‚Äôt utilize your 401k for this.,"&gt; Thinking if i leave it I'll roll it over to a 401k roth?  This isn‚Äôt true. Retirement accounts are either traditional - where contributions are before tax - or they are Roth, where contributions are after tax. They never transfer between the types.  You‚Äôre thinking of a rollover from a 401k - which is a retirement account created by an employer - to an IRA, which is a retirement account that is independent of an employer. But a traditional 401k rolled over to an IRA will yield a traditional IRA , so withdrawals will still be taxed.  As for whether withdrawing is worth it: strictly from a financial standpoint, if you can find any way to avoid withdrawing from your account, do that. That 13 to 14k penalty is that much less money that could compound over the next 30 years, so will hurt you in the long run.  But that doesn‚Äôt take in to account real life stuff, so maybe in your personal circumstance it‚Äôs necessary."

investing,Jul,1eaep9k,FZROX vs VTI in Roth IRA dividend and cap gains?,"VTI has such a low E.R. That I don‚Äôt worry about paying such a tiny fraction per $1,000, versus no E.R. with FZROX.   I am curious, what is paying out more, does VTI earn more in dividends year round than FZROX is paying out yearly in dividends and capital gains. I‚Äôm going to try to do the math in a few and figure this out. But I am curious as to what is everyone‚Äôs preferred total market vessel and why?",If I was with Fidelity I‚Äôd choose FZROX for an IRA for sure.,IMO if I had $1 million in my IRA I‚Äôd happily choose FZROX and treat myself to an expensive $300 steak dinner once a year. No reason to pay the extra 0.03% if you don‚Äôt need to.,"&gt;What‚Äôs stopping them from changing it or charging fees in the future?  The same market pressures that created a no-fee fund.   I've been watching fidelity mutual funds for 20yrs, and I was skeptical at the beginning when some funds had artificially low ER.  The reports would say what the actual ER was and then there would be a credit to lower it with some expiration date.    The credits never went away and the fees never went up.  Anyway, zero risk in a tax-advantaged account since you can liquidate to leave.","I‚Äôm not a big fan of Fidelity using their own proprietary index to do these funds. What‚Äôs stopping them from changing it or charging fees in the future?  Regarding the dividends, it looks like VTI is a tiny bit higher. I like that VTI pays quarterly vs FZROX paying yearly. To me, I‚Äôd rather have that money DRIP back in to buy more shares rather than Fidelity holding it all year.",I like this view. I‚Äôm going to be switching my position.,Dividends aren‚Äôt  the same as cap gains.,There hasn‚Äôt been a cap gains on fzrox for a few years iirc,The dividend yield should be identical. The capital gain yield might be slightly higher on FZROX but within an IRA it's irrelevant. You can choose based on whichever you find easier to manage on your chosen investing platform.,Track the long term returns.  Fidelity I think had some issues picking single stocks and putting money into them that are part of the index.   You can always transfer vti to another brokerage.  But since there are no cap gains anyways in Ira that doesn't matter much as you could sell fzrox.  Personally I prefer etfs but either is find and really won't matter long term return wise.,"With VTI you can do options, you can buy/sell immediately to act on news, and you can use limit orders to obtain shares at a discount compared to the opening or closing price.  It's up to you to decide if all those benefits are worth paying the expense ratio. If you are a diamond-hands buy-and-holder then you probably don't care about the benefits of ETFs, because you never act on news or use options."
investing,Jul,1du4qbj,What to do with whole life policy created for me when I was born,"So I was speaking with my parents the other day, and they informed me that when I was born, they took out a whole life insurance. It's been a little over 30 years since then years since then, and I will be assuming control of it in a couple months. I've only had a chance to take a brief look at the details but my understanding is that the death benefit currently sits at about $163,000 and by the time I take control over it, the cash value will be about $31,000. The annual fee is $600. I am not sure what the rate of return is at this time, and I believe that the taxable gain is around $12,000.  This was quite a surprise to me, since 1) I have never expected to receive something like this from my parents at least until they passed away and 2) I have largely ignored WLI as a money vehicle largely because of this sub.  So, my question to y'all is, what would you recommend that I do with this? I definitely want to view it as a emergency fund, but would you keep it and keep paying the fee, or cash it and invest? I do not have any major debt at this time. Thank you!","Don‚Äôt do anything hasty. Do not just cash it out without doing full research. IF, big If, you are sure that you don‚Äôt need insurance (maybe you‚Äôll have a family and need insurance) then look at 1035 tax free exchange. You could put the cash value into a variable annuity, and have many investment options. (Basically mutual funds in a tax deferred contract. ) Talk to an expert. BTW, Fidelity has very low cost/fee annuities.","(I don't know anything about anything, just asking)...  Isn't $600/yr for a death benefit of just  $163,000 really expensive? Wouldn't a \[reasonably healthy\] 30 year old be able to get like a million for $600/yr? I would assume $163,000 isn't enough of a death benefit anyway for a family.",Keep it. Use the dividends to pay for the premiums. Use excess dividends to buy paid-up insurance. That‚Äôs what I do. I worked in the life insurance industry.,Depends I got one from my parents (similar situation as @op) and mine cost 19$/month but the cash out value increase +6% per year since I got it +10 years ago. At some point I might cash it out but right now I see it as a good investment in addition of being a life insurance.,Cash it out.  While it is nice your parents bought it for you and it has some value it is a terrible return and a terrible price for life insurance.  Cash it out put it in your investments or hold it in a HYSA as an emergency fund.  Buy term life insurance in the amount and length you need.,Term Life Insurance should be way cheaper keeping it is wasting money.,Exactly.  Plus he can collect the cash value.  $30k would pay for 1M term life insurance for 50 years.  It is unlikely he needs that much for that long.,"Sure he could get better term now, up until he is 50 or so. But then the renewal will cost $250 per month or more. And if he goes to see a doctor about a strange mole or cough and it ends up being something serious, then he will never qualify for any amount of life insurance at any price again.   I think people are short-sighted when talking about something like this. I have lost a spouse and luckily we had life insurance in place before the diagnosis. We tried to add term insurance several times, but a bad mole made us ineligible for new insurance. Without the insurance we had in place, I would have lost everything.   I‚Äôm not smart enough for the argument for or against starting a whole life policy, but once one is established I think it‚Äôs worth keeping. If OP lives to be 100 years old they will still have this insurance at $600 per year.   If it were me, I‚Äôd keep it. I think some people get greedy and want the money now. So they justify pulling it out because they could make more elsewhere. Then they spend much of it because they have no discipline. This money is a different kind of investment than stocks. It‚Äôs earning a lower % gain but has an additional possible payout that would make that percentage much much higher.   This is all just my opinion. You and OP can do what you want. I have a whole life policy (in addition to several other retirement accounts) and I bought one for my child as well so they can have paid up insurance for life.",Definitely cash it out. Whole life is garbage,"Yes. If there are enough dividends just let the policy pay itself to stay in force and grow. The beneficiary will get all the money tax free. If you cash it out, you only get the cash value and probably have to pay tax on the growth."

investing,Aug,1f0tgco,So disappointed in the current state of AI after working with it for several years,"We all read the headlines ""AI is coming to take over"", ""new LLM with massive performance gain"", ""something something AI"". Now let's try to apply AI to real world scenarios that provide actual value for companies (to justify the insane valuation of selling golden shovels - yes I am looking at NVIDIA which I miss when it was just a company building gaming GPUs when I was a kid in the early 00's), here are two examples from personal experiences:  * Customer A wants to build a system that replaces humans on the production line for QA. Customer A feeds images to Florence-2, visual GPT or any other pretrained generative AI model. Since the data is so sparse (it has not been trained on defects of a niche production line), the output is just complete garbage ""there's a spider crawling across a web in the middle of the image"" was seriously one of the outputs when asking one model to find dents on a metal surface (super visible obvious dent, even a monkey could be trained to detect it). Then you may ask, but why not train a custom object detection model?  Well surprise surprise, the defect rate is 0.001% so it will take 10 years for the customer to collect enough data to fine tune a model and by that point the production item is obsolete and replaced by a new one, also gen AI can't generate realistic images because, like before - the data does not exist (chicken and egg problem).  * Customer B wants to use an LLM to sanitise code from memory leaks and overflow attacks before it gets pushed into production code. Unfortunately the LLM has been trained on global GitHub data which guess what, contains a bunch of crap code full of memory leaks written by humans (again, shit in - shit out). I've also struggled using copilot or GPT for anything more advanced than really trivial stuff, it also struggles writing test cases, it understands the ""general logic"" of the code however it messes up the details completely.  So why do I post this crap here? Well, there's this general over belief in AI which scares me as I am quite exposed to these companies from an investment standpoint (I've made a shit ton of money out of it, but it just doesn't feel right at the end of the day). Most of the over belief comes from senior positions that have very little insight in how the algorithms actually work and I feel like all the top 10 companies on the S&amp;P are just circlejerking and propping up their valuations without providing any real value rather than a biased glorified search engine. How can I hedge against this AI bullshit when I am forced to buy these companies as part of my global diversification strategy?","That's the problem‚Äîthe implementation of AI should come from the bottom up, from small startups that have found ways to SOLVE PROBLEMS using AI. The problem should come first, followed by the customer experience and then the solution. The technology should be just a means to solve problems. They should solve specific problems, not the other way around, trying to shoehorn AI into everything just because it's a new technology.  There is no way (I mean, in theory, there is) that big, hierarchical companies could generate a solution and useful implementation of AI.","I think LLMs are being misapplied.

There are also a lot of Machine Learning (ML models) that are doing very well and rely on Nvidia chips.  Image processing, for example has done very well in the past 10-15 years.

Natural language processing (NLP) is another; you know how some systems progressively get better search results the more you use it? It uses some type of ML algorithms to learn.  Sensor processing is another different one. A lot of our smart watches uses ML technology for algorithm development.   ML and AI has been doing very well for a very long time, and a lot of it is hidden to the general public. LLMs are just the one that has the most visibility right now because most people don‚Äôt really understand how fundamentally ingrained it is to our day-to-day lives.

Nasa has almost 18k employees, a 25 billion dollar budget, plus - it's literally the government. Not a small start up by any means.

Developed the food safety standards that the nation now used, and which has been credited with doing things like removing glass shards from our food.  Was critical in the construction of the gps system, which has obviously transformed the world in countless ways.  This list could keep going... for a while.  I'm not saying a small start up can't lead the way on AI implementation. There's plenty of examples of start ups changing the world too and solving problems. But it doesn't seem. To me. To be a start up exclusive businesses. Hierarchy and red tape isn't lacking in the wins department on solving problems with the creation and implementation of new technology."

investing,Aug,1emhv76,How Do You Resist The Urge To Check On Your Positions Constantly When Investing Long Term?,"TL;DR at bottom.  My father worked as a stock broker and was always into get-rich-quick schemes, he wasn't an investor, he was a gambling addict who played with other people's money. I don't know how it happened to someone with zero investment portfolio but people gave him MILLIONS to lose that he didn't have. He eventually quit brokering, got lucky and ended up with an extremely high-paying job that gave him enough money to throw away at the stock market. His portfolio was shit, he's never made money as far as I can remember and he lost the family our house. It took getting cancer for him to finally quit his lifelong gambling addiction.  He left me with very little, I am graduating college soon and not wealthy in the slightest. I've recently decided to plan ahead and invest long term with the idea of setting up a recurring purchase every month and not taking it out for decades. ""Park it then forget about it"", as people say. Well I'm having great difficulty ""Forgetting about it"". I don't know if it's the the nerves from my experience growing up or I got a bit of ""Dad"" in my brain but I find myself constantly wanting to check on how my investments are doing. And I fear that I'm going to either want to sell way too early and not as I planned.  Just want some advice on the mentalities of long-term investing, thanks.  TL;DR: Dad was a gambler investor who lost a much of money. I have fears of becoming one since starting to invest.",It gets boring,"When I was younger, I used to worry more about seeing red and panic selling.  Thankfully, learned alot of inexpensive lessons this way while the portfolio was small.  Portfolio has grown, I still check it daily, but mostly just to see how its doing.  I have mostly low cost index funds with broad exposure, so I‚Äôm definitely not selling options or trying to load up on the next Nvidia.    The difference is, staying true to the strategy and investing over time, I see red numbers now just getting the stock while on sale.  As you mentioned, if you are in for the long haul, check as often or as little as you would like - just be consistently contributing and time and compounding will happen.  It took a while to see the snowball start rolling downhill, but it just reinforces the consistent investment strategy and not worrying about down days/weeks etc","I always think of the Bill o Reilley line: ""*tides go*¬†in,¬†*tides go out. You can't explain that.*"" And for some reason this mantra works and makes me not really need to check my portfolio.   I couldn't tell you why.","I check pretty often, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem unless you don‚Äôt have enough self control to not sell off on bad days or you buy more than you can afford too. If you really want to be more hands off and use stock apps, just delete the apps and use desktop/manually log in every time.

I did at one point have a relatively small amount of money that I would buy and sell individual stocks with more or less for the experience but that eventually grew tiring, so I sold all of those and purchased index funds with the money. I do check every day, and I found the fluctuations to be more palatable when I was sticking to a concept that 'made sense to me' (buying index funds) than when it was some company like NVIDA or Apple going up and down. The actual mechanics of when and why things go up or down is just too far divorced from ""this seems like a cool company that has their shit together"" that I just didn't find it worthwhile to play that game.  It also helps to spend some time working with the numbers and realizing that unless you're doing anything really risky there's no get rich quick scheme, the long game is really where the growth is at, so set it and forget it is what I do. When I get dividends or interest from my savings or bonuses that just goes into my brokerage accounts and I buy shares of the ETFs when enough has accumulated.

When I have done these things it's easier to not look, but I'd lie if I said I didn't know what was generally happening on any given day.

A bond fund is just a generic term to describe a fund that holds bonds. But there are lots of different types of bonds. The key criteria is the duration, maturity, and the credit quality of the bonds.   Treasuries are bonds issued by the US government. A T-bill is a type of treasury, so are Treasury Notes. Similar to how Gilts are issued by the UK government, etc. etc. Bonds can also be issued by companies, municipalities, etc. A bond is a debt offering.   So there's a huge difference with SPAXX vs other bond funds. SPAXX is a money market fund. It is a cash equivalent. A money market fund is holds ultras-short duration government obligations such as treasuries, repos, etc.   There are some variants of money market funds - for example a prime money market can hold ultrashort duration commercial paper. Some money market funds are muni based.

Thanks!","So, we can expect slightly better growth but also lower dividends?","If those companies continue to outperform, yes.  If however we see a resurgence of value companies doing better while tech stagnates a bit, you'll probably see the dividend rise as the value companies reclaim a larger % of the index. The tech stagnation would hurt the index more than the value gains though due to their weighting, so you would see worse growth.",Dude look at them during medieval times. Even better.,Because growth is better than dividends. A company can choose to either give a portion of the profits to you as a dividend or to reinvest that money into the company - leading to future growth,"Right, thanks! Great explanation!  Idk why I‚Äôm being downvoted, I am a newbie in this and I am genuinely asking‚Ä¶",&gt;or reinvest that money into the company - leading to future growth  That is if they have something productive that they can reinvest in.     Not every company has ideas just waiting for capital to implement.  Look at Apple - they have some much cash that they can't re-invest it all so they do a lot of share buybacks and pay a small dividend.,Buybacks,"Big shareholders prefer buybacks to dividends, you only pay taxes when you sell. Should anyway",makes me ask myself...... self....... how about RSP?,The S&amp;P just passed dividends along from its composite companies. Tech companies like MSFT and AAPL have pretty low yield and they've begun to take up bigger and bigger portions of the index which would reduce the overall yield of the index

investing,Aug,1evfmhw,What's the reasoning behind investing in bitcoin?,"What motivates people to invest in bitcoin and crypto in general? Hindsight bias, the idea that it will keep making insane gains based on past performance? Or some logical assumptions that crypto will benefit from more widespread use and institutional recognition?  How would you compare the risk of crypto and investment  in huge tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft? Which one do you think is riskier?  Anyone who holds a large part of their investments in crypto can chime in as well.","Keep in mind‚Ä¶  There‚Äôs a very specific type of person on Reddit who replies to /r/investing questions. This is the type of person who likely prides themselves in their financial acumen, and has been interested in investing/making money for some time. They‚Äôve seen Bitcoin‚Äôs price increase 20x in the last five years, and even more if they have been familiar with the asset from before that time.   This type of person doesn‚Äôt want to be wrong. What type of investor misses one of the best performing assets of their lifetime? So if you‚Äôve been familiar with an asset for a long time, that has outsized returns, but never participated in the gain, a lot of these comments start to make more sense imo.","I have yet to hear any convincing reason.  Bitcoin has failed to deliver on all its various promises. This holds true regardless of whether its sentiment is currently in a mania or depression.  * It has failed as a currency. Its volatility is extreme. Transactions are slow and expensive, and the transaction volume is inherently unscalable. Supplementary protocols like Lightning are fundamentally flawed. Usability for consumers is generally terrible. * It is unreliable as a store of value. It has not proven to be a hedge against economic downturns or inflation, as the year 2022 has highlighted. Artificial scarcity alone does not give something lasting value. * It is not a long-term investment. As an unproductive asset without internal cash flow, its price action is driven by short-term speculation, FOMO, and Greater Fool mechanics, ultimately forming a speculative bubble. * The many notoriously unaudited actors in its space, such as Tether, are not worthy of trust and have faced accusations of dishonesty and market manipulation. Consumer protection is nonexistent. * Despite having existed for 15 years, real-world adoption is insignificant, with uses largely confined to gambling, illegal transactions, and generating fees for financial intermediaries such as exchanges or fund providers.  The movement is largely driven by abstract storytelling and FOMO, both at the personal and corporate levels. A key factor is the lack of substantial knowledge or experience in either finance or technology among most enthusiasts, with the majority lacking both.  Only a very small number have practical experience with developing or deploying cryptocurrency technology or have tried to use it seriously for tangible, real-world use cases.  This leads to their being convinced by frankly absurd narratives, such as scarcity implying value, the comparison with gold (a questionable asset in itself), or decentralization being unquestionably an inherent good. In reality, these stories are just excuses to justify the irrational expectation of effortless infinite future returns from an inherently useless asset. At a fundamental level, ""line goes up"" is all there is to it.  The central narrative of decentralization and trustlessness is mostly a mirage. The majority of actual end-consumer services require users to trust unregulated service providers. The majority of the network itself is concentrated around a few mining pools that are able to censor transactions. Ironically, proponents are fleeing from supposedly untrustworthy democratic governments into the arms of unsupervised, unaudited companies and fraudsters.  Exchanges, money managers, and other intermediaries, of course, love to profit from service fees. The fact that a product is nonsensical does not prevent them from selling it to those willing to pay for it. It is just like Walmart selling homeopathy.

investing,Aug,1f5dp17,Nvidia‚Äôs massive stock buyback,"From MarketWatch.   https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-buyback-plan-is-one-of-the-biggest-of-2024-is-that-a-good-thing-9beba5c5?mod=djem_mwnafterbell  &gt; The semiconductor company announced alongside its earnings on Wednesday that it has boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion. That‚Äôs double the size of the $25 billion share-repurchase program announced a year ago  &gt; Looking beyond the year, Nvidia‚Äôs announcement is tied for the 12th-largest [stock buyback] on record. The company is one of only seven in the U.S. to have announced a buyback program of $50 billion or more. The buyback authorization is 1.7% the size of Nvidia‚Äôs market capitalization, which is about $2.91 trillion.  I tend to like stock buybacks. I like them more than dividends. The company has enough faith in itself that it wants to secure more of its own profits.  If you‚Äôre spiraling down in the dumpster, there‚Äôs really no need to buy back‚Äî especially if you believe this is the High Point and it‚Äôs only going down from here.  And has a number of problems. One is that it has a gigantic amount of cash. It was estimated that within three years it might be able to turn out 270 billion in free cash flow  But as the big player in the market, both its own specific market and the broader market, it‚Äôs gonna have a real tough time making big deals. Meaning deals big enough to affect the bottom line.  It‚Äôs in the old-school Microsoft phase where everything it does is gonna be examined for antitrust. Can you imagine if they tried to buy AMD or something like that? It‚Äôs never gonna happen even if it made sense and didn‚Äôt destroy competition.   So they‚Äôve got infinite money and kind of very finite things to do with it. their purchases of other companies has been around 300 *million* this year. Which is entirely insignificant.  However, I worry that the stock is insanely expensive. It‚Äôs noted that this gives them the option to pull the trigger whenever they want. So if there is a downturn, that‚Äôs good news for them because they‚Äôll be able to spend triple digit billions buying themselves back.  So in one sense, you can look at this as potentially bad news. Meaning they expect enough volatility, including down, swings, to make it possible and profitable to have the 12th largest buyback in history.    OR they feel they aren‚Äôt gonna drop and this is just a low point of a forever, climbing stock price.  Either way it‚Äôs good for Nvidia, but it makes it tough for investors to predict. If this was anyone else, I think it would be a little bit easier, but there‚Äôs so much money and the scale is vast that it‚Äôs hard to wrap my head around.   If they had been able to buy the dip a month or so ago, it‚Äôs astounding how much money they would‚Äôve made. Not to mention securing more of their future profits.  Obviously, companies of this size don‚Äôt move that fast and they aren‚Äôt playing a shell game. So it‚Äôs merely just a thought experiment to see how much money they would‚Äôve made.  Lots of companies do buybacks, and lots of high-tech companies do buybacks. And the timing of it can generally illuminate a lot of things. But in this instance, I‚Äôm having a tough time seeing through it.   In the past, they haven‚Äôt been a really savvy financial company. They‚Äôre not doing all kinds of tricks and schemes and mergers and things to burn short sellers and whatever. They‚Äôve just been R&amp;D and managed to get ahead of at least three or four massive shifts in technology in the world economy.   The stock split. I had kind of considered surprising. It just didn‚Äôt fit who they‚Äôve been up to this point. Why does it matter if they‚Äôre 3000 or 100? I suppose it‚Äôs nice that more of the unwashed can get in on the purchase. But it seems to be a small distinction. Like how many people could afford a few hundred bucks but not a few thousand bucks? AND are buy and hold stock investors. I said at the time it wasn‚Äôt gonna move the needle whatsoever. But beyond that, I just don‚Äôt really see the point.  As I‚Äôve said, there‚Äôs a lot of reasons to do a stock buyback. But this magnitude and at this price have left me guessing.  I like to think it‚Äôs optimism of their future. And that two years from now the stock is going to be much higher. In which case it made perfect sense to buy now.  That‚Äôs my hope anyways.   Edit: sorry for typos my phone won‚Äôt let me scroll back for some reason","I mean this is a common criticisms of stock buy backs  In general a company does well, it makes a ton of cash then the question is what to do with the cash and well one answer is return it to the owners  Well at the same time because the company is doing well and making a ton of cash the market has pushed it stock price up because well its a good company making a ton of cash  So yea a common criticism of buy backs is they happen when the stock price is high because that usually is also when the company is making a ton of cash and has free cash flow to return it to investors  I guess a potential alternative is just to declare special dividends and return the cash via a special dividend but that also comes with taxes for the owners","I'm not a big fan of buybacks or dividends in a company that is still growing quickly, I'd rather see cash reinvested into the business. 50B sounds like a lot, but this is a company worth 3T. 50B is roughly 1.6% of float, not exactly a big impact.   This company is being priced at insanely high growth expectations, use the cash to meet and exceed those expectations, not to bolster short term share value","I‚Äôll just focus on your first point here which is ‚Äúthey could invest more in R&amp;D‚Äù. They could but would that really improve results? R&amp;D is not something you can just linearly scale by adding more money. That‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúif one woman can produce a baby in 9 months, 9 women could do it in one month‚Äù.",I have owned NVDA stock for years. The stock buy back is essentially taking profits and putting them in Jensen and other employees pockets via their stock options.  I don‚Äôt have a problem with that because they have built the company from the ground up.   The hyper growth is over but I believe NVDA can still outperform the 500 for a few years.,IMO they would be better off using the cash to acquire companies than repurchasing their own shares at inflated valuations.,Gobbling up companies isn‚Äôt as seamless as it sounds and can run afoul of regulators,"it's not short term gain, and you need to buy back to prevent share dilution. in your mind how exactly would they use $50B to invest in growth?","Look back on the history of market ""darlings"" doing buybacks. It's not great. Investors, not speculators, would almost always be better served by ""locking in"" those gains with a big dividend rather than the buyback.  The market tends to reclaim those buyback gains, if there are any. Nvidia is in a high capex business. It's hard to believe they really can't find any investment opportunities better than buying their own shares. Particularly at current valuations.  Going back in history a bit, you *can* find success stories. Apple, when they were initially authorizing positively gigantic buybacks, could have been argued to be grossly undervalued. It's hard to believe but the market used to hate Apple.  But the market *absolutely adores* Nvidia. There is no undervaluation problem here.",Oh gee I wonder what this company could have spent its money on instead of buybacks? ¬†Perhaps R+D and not doing cost cutting where the planes fall out of the sky and the doors fall off?  &gt;Boeing had spent a staggering $43 billion on stock buybacks between 2013 and 2019,"It's not a lump sum buyback, but it's still short term relatively.   They could invest more in R&amp;D, Blackwell production, expansion into foreign markets, attracting top talent, etc. Honestly it's not really my job to tell them how to invest their money, it's their job to figure out the best way to invest it. I just don't believe a buyback is the best way to invest 50B in their current stage of a company"
investing,Aug,1elmq58,How aggressive are you at say age 50 in the stock market?,"Good afternoon,  As an example, a 25 year old should be pretty aggressive right?  A 70 year old is basically complete opposite.  What kind of approach does a 60 year old take?  I'm trying to figure out how aggressive my approach would be at that age. I'm 40 years old.

Thanks",Thanks for your feedback :),"The question isn‚Äôt only age, but also how many years until you are going to start tapping the account for income ‚Äî and how much growth you need to likely reach your goals.  For example, a 50-year-old who isn‚Äôt planning to touch his/her Roth IRA until they are 80 (if ever) can be a lot more aggressive than a 40-year-old who plans to start tapping their investments for early retirement at 55.","I'm 50 and I want to retire at 58, so I'm very aggressive. It's all about wealth accumulation.  I can't file for my pension or social security, so I need to use investment as income. If I were going to retire at 67, then I would get conservative (buying fixed assets) when I was 62.","My personal opinion is 3-4 years before you plan on taking income. We've had two catastrophic economic events in this century, 2008 and COVID. Of the two, 2008 took longer to recover from, that took 18 months to fully recover loses. If you're worried about recovering losses in the event of a downturn before retirement and avoiding a downturn just before pulling income, I'd say 3-4 years is more than safe.   For me personally, I'm 100% in the markets. I'm a month away from 42 and have zero of my retirement in safe returns, its all mid to high risk. The markets aren't what they were 20-30 years ago. With pensions all but disappearing, the overwhelming majority of Americans rely on the markets for retirement and prop it up with contributions every pay cycle.

investing,Aug,1exmdnf,Only holds s&amp;p500 for long term?,"This might be a common question, but I‚Äôm curious if anyone out there has stuck with just the S&amp;P 500 without diversifying into anything else. After the recent market downturn, I realized that my attempts at risk management with different investments actually led to losses beyond what I could handle. Sticking to just the S&amp;P 500 seems like it might give me better control over my risk. I'm just an amateur trader, so I'd love to hear what professional traders think about this idea.",Yes that is a fairly common strategy,"I‚Äôll take warren buffet‚Äôs advice, one of the greatest investors in the world, who‚Äôs been studying the market since the 50‚Äôs and crushing it. ‚ÄúNever bet against America‚Äù‚Äùbuy and hold S&amp;P over a long period of time‚Äù.","I‚Äôve been investing for a long time. I had a self employed IRA that was S and P 500. It had higher limits so I put more in there than I did into other accounts, so it‚Äôs not apples to apples. I had a Roth IRA in a Schwab balanced fund and my wife‚Äôs IRA in a Vanguard social index fund. I maxed them all out over the years whenever I could, except for the SEP. The limits were so high I couldn‚Äôt make it to the limit, but I was putting maybe 2x or 3x in there compared to the others but only for the 15 years or so I was self employed. The rest of the time it‚Äôs just sat there growing on its own.  The result after 30 years is the S and P 500 fund is about 2/3 of the portfolio. It grew faster and it had more starting money. In hindsight, that turned out to be a great move. Most of my retirement funding is going to come out of there. Biggest mistake was keeping the Roth in a balanced fund with a lot of bonds. After 30 years of maxing it out it‚Äôs only about 10% of the portfolio. I wound up switching it into a Fidelity Nasdaq fund a few years ago to help it catch up,  but it‚Äôs too late,. Missing out on those high returns early on really hurt it in the long run. My take away is don‚Äôt bother with bond funds when you‚Äôre young and put the Roth in your higher returning ‚Äúrisky‚Äù funds. If I did that maybe the Roth would be 2/3 of the portfolio and the SEP was 10% instead of the other way around and  I could have live more or less tax free for the rest of my days.  But even with the mistake of being too conservative early on with the Roth, the S and P rocketing up all that time should give me enough for a comfortable and long retirement. I recommend S and P 500 for my kids all the time.","Yes my 401k is 100% SP500.   The though being, if the SP500 goes to zero, we‚Äôve got bigger problems.","The S&amp;P 500 index is diversified by revenues and has a global exposure on that basis.  But it is still an equity product. It can still be prone to large and regular drawdowns.   Bear markets occur every 2/3 years, corrections almost annually.   But on a long enough timescale it is ""almost"" impossible to lose money. I.e. 20 years.   So it's a long game. Don't check your portfolio everyday, because whilst stocks move around a lot, fundamentally, businesses change at a much slower rate. That's the secret sauce.   However, if you don't have the risk tolerence, then you need an investment strategy that works for you. But there aren't many that match US equities on a real return basis.",My boglehead mind can‚Äôt comprehend investing into anything but VT or S&amp;P500,"Leverage changes the dynamics - when the S&amp;P goes down, like recently, you end up losing way more.

What about 500K, 2M, 5M ...  I assume at some point it doesn't really make sense to give up the higher returns because even with a 2008 50% drawdown, you'd still have more than enough liquid funds to live on?","People make this argument, and maybe they're not completely wrong but the odds of having a job loss coincide with a market downturn are too high for my taste.   I like my emergency funds being in readily accessible, FDIC insured form.   As your net worth goes up, the percent of your net worth that is in ""emergency funds"" can go down, but the absolute number stays about the same because it's based on expenses (at least for me).","The more money you have, the less important it becomes to optimize every last dollar. So it‚Äôs a bit unintuitive perhaps, but it actually becomes easier to hold a reasonable amount of expenses in cash the wealthier you become.",Yeah but then you are sending down shares at market lows and are less able to participate in the recovery,"Once you start getting into ultra high net worth territory, you start seeing more abnormal stores of wealth.

It doesn't matter to me at all if there's a 70% likelihood that I can earn more with my emergency funds by taking on more risk with them.  It could be 98%.  The point is not to raise the ceiling, it's to raise the floor.",I‚Äôm similar but I‚Äôm ok with SIPC insured USFR to get a bit more interest on my EF.,"The point isn‚Äôt necessarily that the S&amp;P drops so low that you no longer have enough money for an emergency, but rather that you would be forced to sell those shares during a significant downturn before they have had time to rebound, locking in a significant loss.   In the above situation if you had cash/cash equivalents, you can leave your investments untouched while the market rebounds and supplement from your cash or even invest more from your cash on hand during a crash so that you can ride the market all the way back up.   That being said, how much you keep on hand can vary. I have ~$1mm invested in the market and keep approximated $30k in cash in a HYSA for emergencies. This is about 3 months of normal spending or 6-8 months of spending where we cut down to the bare minimum.   There‚Äôs really no right answer here but you do need to factor in the opportunity cost of having to sell shares during a downturn since you will no longer benefit from their gains as the market recovers.","&gt;  because i have lots of lines of credits   There was a fairly recent post on PF where someone was getting their credit limits reduced after they lost their job and started paying minimums on the credit cards.

Why have a cash allocation if not to be used for some purpose?   I realize most everyone will miss the bottom, but using your cash on the way down and back up isn't unreasonable. Its basically when to start using it and at what rate is an interesting discussion. I would say something like using 5% of your cash allocation a week once we drop below 10% is quite reasonable. I would also say that as soon as we recover you should sell and get your cash allocation restored. Each to their own I suppose though.

investing,Aug,1elzqve,"As a 25 year old, should buying a house be my first priority as an investment?","I am 25 years old and I am really wanting to buy a house as soon as possible. I know the market isn't that good currently, but the thing is I don't see it getting any better any time soon. So what's the point of waiting? The thing is I don't see the American housing market situation improving any time soon. Couple of things.  1) There's just not enough supply for the demand of housing. And housing isn't really something that you can push out the supply as fast as other products.   2) I am constantly hearing how large corporations are buying up large swaths of single family homes and renting them out. So are there even going to be homes to buy if I keep waiting? Or will I be a subject to a landlord forever?   3) I am not a xenophobic (I myself am an immigrant), but I do worry about the very high numbers new migrants coming to the US. Like I believe a few years ago under another administration I read that if borders cross got over 1,000 a day it would be a national emergency, I believe a few months back it crossed 3,000. Again, as an immigrant myself I know quite a few people like that, I know how hard they're willing to work and how much more they're willing to struggle. I know guys that work like 20 hours a day and share a small apartment with like 8 other people.  I can't compete with that. Eventually once they get their papers, they're going to be looking for a house too. So demand is just going to keep increasing.   4) Sometimes I'll hear that maybe this housing bubble will burst. Almost every home I look on Zillow around me is quite literally double than what is was pre-pandemic (2019/2020). Houses that were 200k, are now 400k. Houses that were 300k are now 600k. The thing is, if this bubble burst, and prices do fall... I know there'll be millions of Gen Z that have saved up money to buy a house that will immdeiatly pounce on the opporunity. I know so many friends/collouges that have like 40, 50, 60k in savings just itching to buy a house when prices lower. So if that happens, won't prices just go back up then? Because everyone will just competing to buy the available homes?  All these things considered, so I am (as like many Gen Z) just worried about my future, if I'll ever be able to be a homeowner, as it is the dream of many Americans, and think, if it looks like things aren't really going to improve, why not buy now?",This is the best answer here imo,"I‚Äôm in a similar boat too but a little older. Ya, buying a home is typically a good investment. Without knowing your current financial picture there are a lot of other ways to help your situation.   1st: Pay off debts (student loans, car, credit cards)  2nd: Save for retirement. Take advantage of any 401k match your company offers and if they don‚Äôt offer any then try to max your Roth IRA. (You may be able to withdrawal some of the money in a Roth IRA for the down payment of your house. pls double check this)  3: live your life and invest in yourself. You will come into money and compound interest is on your side. If you happen to get married then you will have a dual income and buying a home likely won‚Äôt be as daunting","IMO no retirement savings should be your number one priority at your age. Compounding interest works wonders when you give it a lot of time. Start too late, and you‚Äôll screw yourself.",No. You should be saving money and you know eventually you will have enough for a down payment but it‚Äôs honestly so unhealthy to think that your success depends on buying a house especially at 25.,"Hi, all these other comments are pretty gloomy.  While housing prices do rise,  Rental prices are rising much faster.  When you find a place you like as a renter, the landlord has the right to increase the cost of rent every year.  Unless you want to keep moving your monthly expenses are going to keep going up.    Finding a home you love that you can afford can be challenging.  I found one in LA back in 2004 and everyone said it was impossible.  The home needed repairs but I got these done for under 10K and had a nice, relatively cheap place to live.  My equity in my home doubled in 6 months.  Fast forward to 2016 when I tried to buy something in a Southern state.  I thought this would be simple as prices were cheaper and there was more inventory.  It was still tough and the inventory was bought up quickly.  I persisted and found a home I could afford.  The mortgage was less than my rent in my crummy apartment. The value of my home went up 50% and keeps increasing.  It is a matter of deciding what you want to buy, working out what you can afford, and then looking, looking, looking until you find your place.  There are some expenses associated with owning a home but knowing you have a place that is yours to do what you wish with is a great feeling.","Im about the same age a few years older and there's no way I'm looking to buy a house in this market.  Housing prices are insane and on top of that interest rates are equally insane.  That's a bad mix.  Look for an apartment/home to rent with either a friend or with a roommate to split costs.  Get a 401k setup and start adding to that and maybe throw some money into cd's, bonds, stocks, easiest a high interest savings account.  Save money until either housing prices drop or interest rates do.  At some point one or both will come down but it will take a few years.","I'm about the same age and there's no way I'm looking to buy a house in this market.

Throw all that extra cash in investments and buy something when you have the time and money to comfortably afford it!","Around here a 1br apartment costs the same per month as a 4br house‚Ä¶ and a lot of what you pay in mortgage is recoupd when you sell.   The downside is the effort to buy/sell and the number of one-time costs. Loan origination fees, taxes and more insurance, and updates and repairs.

Not a huge part but most def has a part in it.  Illegal Immigrants are  being handed rentals, food, and money.  So while the fed is attempting to get everything stable and back on track, the government is simultaneously pumping up the economy by literally handing out free money to millions of new immigrants. That's not a good thing right now.  And to your point of supply issues.  That's bogus.  We are years out of covid.

investing,Aug,1eptg7j,Washington Post gift article: Insurance lobbyists block federal crackdown on costly retirement advice,"For your reading pleasure:  https://wapo.st/46FDMu0  From what I understand, there is an attempt to regulate insurance salespeople that masquerade as financial advisors. An insurance company lobbying attempt is, shockingly, trying to prevent these regulations.  I found the perspectives on what different stakeholders think about potential regulations around investment products interesting.  From the article: ‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôre saying is, the only way they can operate is by giving you advice that is not in your best interest,‚Äù said Bill Sweeney, the senior vice president for government affairs at AARP. ‚ÄúIf they hung that on their shingle ‚Ä¶ no one would go to that financial adviser.‚Äù  We are always seeing posts here about ‚Äúis this product good for me?‚Äù ‚Äúmake sure to get a fiduciary advisor‚Äù ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need an advisor at all‚Äù ‚Äúyour advisor is giving you poor advice and taking advantage of you‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre paying way too much for this kind of advice‚Äù etc.  Thoughts? Apologies if someone else has already posted this for discussion and I missed it.","If you treat financial advisors and insurance salespeople like they are hardened criminals, you will probably do alright.  The AUM fee structure and commission incentives to churn through high expense investments is contrary to the individual investor‚Äôs long-term goals.   Selling shitty annuities or whole life insurance to the financially illiterate because it yields a juicy commission is repulsive.  These guys can‚Äôt pick stocks, time the market, or do anything more than possibly protect you from your own impulse to buy high and sell low.  I say crack down on these crooks.","I don‚Äôt think they are all necessarily bad. I had a fiduciary financial advisor for a while. I wanted and needed a checkup for my peace of mind. I found the advice to be sound, and the relationship was terminated professionally once I no longer needed his advice/kudos/encouragement, whatever you want to call it.  What I find to be reprehensible is laypeople who don‚Äôt have a good background in finance, and someone taking advantage of them because they don‚Äôt know any better. That should be illegal/regulated, to limit the incentive of bad actors to take advantage of naive people.",That is a question for r/politics,"I mean, there is good lobbying. You just only hear about the bad kind. But there are lobbyists that fight for good interests and causes. Getting rid of lobbying I feel isn‚Äôt the answer. It‚Äôs regulating it.","If they are a fiduciary, they legally can't do this.  If they are a fee-only advisor, they legally can't do this.  Those are the protections available.

The resources put into running that industry are wasted because it only exists by scamming people.",What is it that I don't understand?,"How exactly would you do that? As long as politicians have to run for reelection they need to raise campaign funds, hence lobbyists have a lot of power over them. And we all know the problems with dictatorships where they don't have elections.","As someone who carries an active s65 license I'm all for the industry cracking down on the insurance side of the industry. The amount of people I work with that are loaded up with all these bullshit annuities and insurance products their ""advisor"" sold them is just sad.","&gt;The AUM fee structure and commission incentives to churn through high expense investments is contrary to the individual investor‚Äôs long-term goals.  Aum fee structure and commission based products are two different things. The real issue is that dual registration is allowed where someone can be both licensed to provide investment advise for a fee while still being allowed to sell commission products.   Aum fee structures on there own aren't a bad thing especially when you have less savy investors. If the aum fee is the only source of revenue for that advisor there is actually an incentive structure that aligns with the fiduciary duty to the client.  &gt;These guys can‚Äôt pick stocks, time the market, or do anything more than possibly protect you from your own impulse to buy high and sell low.  Not entirely true, though a lot of active managers fail to outpace the market it also comes down to the goals of the clients. Many clients aren't looking to beat the market and therefore take a less aggressive approach causing them to ""underperform"". Also an advisor can only do so much to prevent a client from bailing in a bad market, well alway try to keep out clients heads on but some people are less rational.  &gt;Selling shitty annuities or whole life insurance to the financially illiterate because it yields a juicy commission is repulsive.  I'll agree with you for the most part here, annuities and certain insurance policies like term life or long term care CAN make sense but it really depends on the client and again I'm of the opinion that this isn't an area where an advisor should be allowed to make a commission. There is definitely a lot of garbage and snake oil salesmen in this segment for sure.","Just like real estate agents who get paid the same for doing extra or absolutely nothing, the financial services industry should be under scrutiny for advisors that do absolutely nothing but churn the portfolio and lead to higher tax consequences"
investing,Aug,1exwpqq,TIL high-yield bonds have outperformed stocks in the developed world outside the US for the past 20 years,"I was studying the [Calan Chart](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Callan_periodic_table_of_investment_returns) showing annual returns from 2004-2023 by asset class and was surprised to see that high-yield bonds have had a higher average return over the last 20 years, with a lower standard deviation, than stocks from the developed world excluding the US! High-yield bonds returned 7.62% per year on average with a 15.75% standard deviation, while the MSCI World ex USA Index returned 7.46% per year on average with an 18.31% standard deviation. Makes me wonder if this is normal, or if the last 20 years have been an exception.","I don't see anything particularly surprising about this, but I think 2008 and 2009 are skewing your numbers. If you exclude those years, then Int'l definitely beats out HY.   High yield is less risky than equities given that it's lower in the capital stack, so generally trades with lower volatility. High yield spreads are among the tightest they've ever been. The difference in valuations between Int'l and US equities has rarely been wider (i.e. US HY is expensive, and Int'l stocks are cheap).

I‚Äôm planning on having recurring investments on a weekly basis and holding until retirement. I‚Äôd like to have 1 with a high dividend and 1 with heavy tech weight. When I get close to retirement I will be periodically putting the money into bonds to keep it more safe. What 4 ETFs and what percentage of total investment for each etf would yall choose if you were in your 20s starting out? Thanks again for reading and commenting!,Heavy tech weight - QQQ 20% SMALL CAPS AVUV 20% VTI 30% VOO 30%  DONE.

The top 5 in order of gains are;  -SOXX (semiconductors)  -XHB (homebuilders)  -VGT (tech)  -FIW (water)  -GRID (smart energy grids)  -VTI (total US).  With that in mind, maybe consider doing;  - VGT/QQQM (pick 1) - VTI/VOO (pick 1) - SCHD - XHB/FIW/GRID (pick 1 or 34/33/33%).  I don't think you can lose with a portfolio like that. We will always need home builders, especially with home shortages. Soon we might desperately need more water tech and water companies trying to solve world droughts, efficiently converting sea water to drinking water, etc., and water is something we will always need, or soon need in more demand.   Using M1 Finance makes it easy to hold multiple ETFs, putting more money on the ETFs that are down to buy them cheaper while not buying the ones that are up, and rebalancing accounts.","I used to be a Boglehead, but I'm impatient and have a high-risk tolerance. I'd invest in one broad market ETF anything from XLG (top 50 stocks of the S&amp;P 500) to VT (Total World) for something slow, steady, and safe.      I'd also go with one high-risk high-reward ETF. If you're more conservative, I'd go with QQQM (Nasdaq-100) or SMH (semiconductors) for something extra spicey.

If you rolled over a 401k into another 401k, then you can easily do the backdoor Roth, no restrictions. If you rollover'd your 401k into an IRA, then you can do two things. 1 is roll it back into your current 401k, or 2. just do a backdoor Roth conversion and pay the taxes on your 4k and convert them as well.  Second,  the mega backdoor Roth and Roth backdoor are different things. The mega backdoor can be done without dealing or caring about any traditional IRAs you have.","But you can directly contribute $40k to an after tax 401k and immediately convert it to Roth, so yes, you can contribute $40k to a Roth 401k in addition to the direct contribution limit. Which is why ""just use a Roth IRA"" is not helpful advice."
investing,Aug,1ex8wvw,WARNING: Investing w/ GROUNDFLOOR,"Hey All,  Unsure if this is allowed, but wanted to caution people against investing with Groundfloor.   Quick back story...  I invested a large sum on Groundfloor ($300K+), distributed across 100+ notes in 2022. They were intended to be short term investments, with maturities coming up in the next 1-2 months. Three months later, almost nothing was paid out - which is fine, I get there were weird things happening in the economy, but rates were still low.   I asked what was happening with the notes since they all still said they were current. They said they granted the owners a one-time extension for 90 days due to COVID. They said ""good news is you have almost no notes in default!"" To which I said yeah, I'd have like 90% in default but you gave everyone an extension. They assured me it was the best course to recover the capital in a timely fashion and that supply issues were just delaying remodels a bit.   Three months later, more extensions - even though they said it was a one-time extension. Two years later and I have notes that matured as far back as January 2022. They didn't start foreclosures for over a year, while the fed kept hiking rates, and I kept raising hell. They kept brushing me off.   My ""return"" right now is 5.5%, but it ignores the almost $100K in defaulted loans I hold, some of which now have notes like ""foreclosures in this state can take 12-18 months and the process has started.""  Company is a fucking joke. Their statistics are crazy misleading and they manipulate them to paint a much rosier picture than reality. I've also asked for history of my support messages to address their ""one-time"" claim and they say they don't keep history for accounts that far back. Kind of hoping someone more motivated than me sues them into oblivion.   I'll be fine in the end but an expensive lesson I figured I'd pass on to try to save someone else the pain.   Fuck Groundfloor.    EDIT: Someone pointed out a good thing to clarify - I invested in their LRO's, not their notes. I suspect the notes are fine.",fuck groundfloor that sounds like a scam. i just invest in REIT stocks instead,"I will never put majority of my money into any Fintech platform (e.g., Robinhood, masterwork etc.). That's just asking for trouble.","Bummer that you got caught up in that.   Every time someone mentions Groudfloor, Fundrise, etc. - someone smarter than me will usually come around to explain why these products are simply unsecured opaque junk bonds with lower yield and higher risk.   I've never quite understood the appeal of these platforms.","why the hell did you invest 300k in this? do you have like 30 million lying around? because that'd be the only way i'd feel remotely comfortable risking my money like this (as in, i'd give it no more than 1% weight and i'd even feel bad about that).  it just seems like mediocre returns at best, and a straight up scam at worst (well, not really at worst. more like, straight up).","Haha, it wasn't a massive risk for me but as for the why... at the time, money markets were yielding basically 0% and I was able to borrow on my equities at fed rate + 100 basis points. So I'm borrowing at ~1.25%, getting 8-10% yields, on ""short-term"" investments. It was an arbitrage play. (That didn't work out obviously...)",fits better in ripoff rpt site.

At least you can cash out of REITs whenever without all that drama.","1. they wouldn't let people execute trades when a short squeeze was underway for stocks like gamestop or amc  2. they wouldn't let customers actually own crypto (i.e. send it to private wallets); they advertised as if you could buy it, but really you can only day trade it, i.e. you can only withdraw standard fiat currencies from them (so you never actually own the crypto) -- I have heard that's changed now but I doubt it.","Seriously the misinformation. For all the issues with Robinhood, they are not involved with some weird conspiracy to protect the rich. Gamestop simply traded so much and was so volatile that the stock clearinghouse that Robinhood used issued a margin call to Robinhood for more than the cash they had. For about a day there, they were technically bankrupt while the shopped around desperate for short term financing. This wasn't hidden or anything, people speculated that this was what happened at the time and it was confirmed a few months later. It would have happened to anyone, even schwab.","I did some LendingClub many years ago. I think the institutions bought all the good notes. They are better situated to do the analysis to pick the best loans. In any case, returns were pretty shitty, compared to the general stock market. Like sub 5% returns before taxes. I guess it counts as diversifying? But it took almost ten years for the last note to be paid or charged off. So every year have to deal with another tax form. I only put in a few thousand but I won't be wasting time with this again in the future."
investing,Aug,1et0a1u,What makes bonds so difficult? ,I want to invest a portion of my portfolio (10k usd) into bonds. A lot of in person advice and r/Bogleheads make bond investing seem complicated. I did very surface level research and know how to buy bonds on Charles Schwab (my broker) but what are the hesitations with investing in bonds? Why is it not recommended for many (especially younger) investors?,"Idk what makes bonds difficult but the reason people tell younger investors to maybe look for another type of investment is because bonds are very low yield, safe investments. Many are of the opinion that if you are young and have lots of time before you retire you should play your early game a little more risky.","Bonds are boring, safe investments. Young investors with decades ahead of them are better served looking for capital gains in stocks.",Giving someone an ETF that that has had 50% swings in the last 5 years as a bond replacement sure is one of the most ideas of all time.,"Agreed, I will additionally point out that bonds can be really good if you're trying to make a home purchase or similar, because they're so reliable.  More than age, bonds vs stocks are really about how soon you want to spend that particular money. Most of my money is in stocks for example, but I've got a steady bond growth that's gonna be a down payment when I want to buy a house in a few years.","You don't **know** that VTI will recover. It always has, but that doesn't mean that it always will. One thing about bonds, you'll always realize the YTM from when you bought the bond (unless there's a default). In that sense, the bonds do recover.",Tons of bogleheads do 80/20 equities and bonds when they're relatively young for exactly that reason and move to 60/40 as the get older,"I think this is wrong - buying true bonds (not a bond fund) is much harder than buying an ETF or a stock.  Much, much harder and convoluted.  But other posters have pointed out that with a 20+ year time horizon on needing those funds, bonds simply underperform so much that they aren't worth considering.  In retirement, they're one way to preserve capital in the case of downturns, so that while the equity portion of your portfolio is down you don't have to sell any of it to life off of, you have bonds paying you or that you can sell.","The stock market could tank and take forever to recover while the US economy's fine.   Firm valuations come from discounting future earnings. If interest rates rise, the risk free rate rises, which make the equity risk premius rise. The discount rate is the sum of the ERP and and risk free rate, so rising interest rate, all else equal, would tank the stock market without directly affecting the economy.","Its not market timing at all. Its risk parity investing. Its the same thing as a target date fund. When stocks do very well and the yearly rebalance day hits, they sell stocks and buy bonds. When bonda do fine but stocks plumment, they sell bonds and buy stocks. Its countercyclical which is actually a good thing in investing. It wont always produce the most gains, but the risk adjusted returns are better.","&gt;you go to the¬†[treasury direct website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/), and buy the ones you want.. its as simple as that really.  Keep in mind that you can't sell bonds at TD at all before maturity. Transferring them to a broker to sell is a difficult and slow process - slow like 6+ months."

We have one individual who is extremely risk averse and likes to try and out think his friends. I can usually provide a solution but this one is stumping me. He has a very large allocation to the general market, and he has a very large allocation to TBills. As he ages up, he wants to a create a fund that will return whatever the TBill value is plus 2% return that he never touches. Anyone have ideas on how they would create this idea? The never touches part is critical as he doesn't want someone selling options on this account.","The issue here is, if you can make TBill +2% guaranteed work you should be able to make 'anything' +2% work and, you can't.

You can probably also add TIPS.  Those numbers may not repeat going forward but I think that kind of portfolio may be the best option. Going with modern portfolio theory, you can have a well diversified portfolio with good risk adjusted returns and then you de-risk it adding cash.

investing,Aug,1et8t8c,Teaching my daughter about investing,"So here is the deal (feel free to delete this if it isn't allowed).  I'd like to teach my 11 year old daughter about investing.  I've gone over the basics with her like what shares are, and what they actually mean.  I've talked about dividends and yields and all those things.  We are to the point where I would like her to have some real world experience.  I've decided that the way I would like this to work is to ""give"" each of them an investing account.  I have three accounts with Fidelity, each named after each of them.  Technically they are all in my name because I want to retain the account as mine own (for tax purposes).  In each account I placed $100.  They all get to do this when they hit 11 years old.  So now here we are with the first daughter reaching 11 and I'm finding it rather hard to watch her decide what to invest in.  Basically she has chosen two companies, Coca-cola and Ford.  She like the drink and her uncle works at Ford.  That's her reasoning right now.  She isn't sure how much she would like to do for each and I'm not sure how to guide her.  Currently her plan is to take the $100 and just split it.  Is there a better way to teach that?  Also, I'm just struggling to let her make these choices.  I know the two companies she chose are solid companies.  They may not make her tons of money but they aren't going to go belly up either, it's just really hard.  Does this method of teaching seem to be a good method?    Thanks for any advice.",I would also show her to put like 25% into VOO. She can then compare these individual stock performance to VOO. She‚Äôll learn that stock picking is really really hard.,"Nice idea but don‚Äôt forget she‚Äôs only 11, what reasoning other than liking the drink and her uncle working at Ford were you expecting?üòÇ","This is the answer. OP, let your daughter pick whatever stocks she wants with the $100, then match ‚Äúher‚Äù contribution with $100 of FXAIX (S&amp;P 500) or FSKAX (Total Stock Market). Every year on her birthday look at the account together to see what is currently winning.

There is a lot of talk about passive funds creating causing over-valuation. But if that is true - shouldnt other asset classes -  real estate be cheaper? Or bonds to give exceptionally high returns (before FED raised interest rates, bond prices were high too/yields were low). Maybe I am confusing the topic by bringing up FED, so ignore bonds/FED rates if thats the case.

Empirically, companies still see reliable short-term price changes when they have positive or negative earning surprises, so an active investor with talent at predicting earnings can easily make money. And if future earnings are less priced in than they used to be, it should be easier to predict future earnings. Therefore, active investors should make more money.",You're not doing enough bargain hunting. Right now government bonds and infrastructure funds are extremely good value.

But there's this one peculiar thing: the pricing of FMC and HXL doesn't make sense.  HXL grew their revenue by 23% and their EBITDA by 74%. In contrast, FMC shrank their revenue by 13% and shrank their EBITDA by a whopping 60%!  And in this period their respective stock prices performed more or less the same. One could argue that it's because investors have more trust in the future of FMC's agrucultural products than in the future of HXL's advanced materials. But I don't think this is the case, both are somewhat boring technical products that investors don't have that much insight into.   No, I think the real difference is that FMC is in the S&amp;P 500 and HXL is not and their stock performance is propped up by investors blindly shipping capital into S&amp;P 500 ETFs. The P/S ratio of the S&amp;P 500 has grown by 30% since 2019 meaning you are paying 30% more for the earnings the companies generate.   It will be interesting to keep track on this effect.

investing,Aug,1euk0rr,REITS Trading at the Lowest Levels since 2008,"REITS are trading at a 10% Discount  If you were to go back over the past 20 years, REITS have traded at a 30% premium on average  And we haven‚Äôt seen the REIT index at a discount really outside of the pandemic, the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the early 2000s.    - Barron‚Äôs",I assume most REITs include commercial real estate and commercial real estate is in bad shape and heading for even more challenging times ahead.,Most of the REITS I own have been a lot lower in price at some point in the last year.,Anyone has analysed the average historical impact of interest rates cuts on REITS?  What is your preferred REIT?,Iron Mountain,"Covid sped up an already existing secular tailwind: the rise of e-commerce. Every month that passes by, the more people move towards online shopping. Stores have fewer and fewer walk-in customers. Many went under during covid and their storefronts never get rented out again due to a lack of demand.   Malls have largely died - sure, you can find some nice malls in some big cities but go to any city with 75,000 or 125,000 people and their mall is a mausoleum if it is even still open. People buy their groceries, clothes, etc. online. Shipping times for most companies are down to one or maybe two days. You can order groceries in many cities and have them delivered within a couple hours. You can order your prescription medicine online - and Amazon is rapidly expanding its market share in pharmacies.   Companies that have not successfully transitioned to online sales have started going under - Kohl's remains one of the few remaining big box clothing stores for example but they are closing stores rapidly. Like Walgreens. And CVS.   Covid closed everything. That ended many small businesses which didn't have the ability to survive the pandemic. Their storefronts were largely not rented out again, never replaced. Malls shuttered.   As for office space? That story has been written about extensively - work from home has decreased demand for office space by some ungodly percentage that I can't remember off the top of my head. And let's be honest with ourselves - those companies aren't going back to the office if they haven't already. Work from home is here to stay and will expand to more and more industries which will further drive down demand for office space.      Meanwhile, industrial REITs have benefitted because of many of their roles in logistics. PLD in particular has benefitted, providing automated warehouses to companies like Amazon in central hubs to allow for same-day deliveries which are further eroding walk-in stores' customer base.",office REITs are mostly private and office only accounts for about 3% of the listed REIT market,REIT is a business structure. Know what type of business the one you are interested in is actually doing. New construction? Leasing? Commercial? Residential? Biomedical? IT?  Not all real estate is created equal.,"A reader's comment there seems pertinent. From R Paul Drake:  &amp;#x200B; &gt;There are some significant factual errors in this piece. Firstly, REITs must payout 90% of taxable income, NOT cash flows. The enormous difference is unrealistic GAAP depreciation, which allows many REIT to pay out less that 70%, and sometimes less than 60%, of cash flows. This leaves retained earnings that many of them are now using to drive growth.  &gt; &gt;Second, few REITs have ""struggled"" in recent years economically. Economically, most of them have been growing cash flow per share. This is particularly true of retail REITs, whose reputation to the contrary is very much at odds with reality. &gt; &gt;The big headwind, economically, has been interest-rate costs, which had a significant, one-time impact on REITs with large floating-rate debt. This includes Sun Communities, who has changed their tactics in response and may grow more slowly going forward. &gt; &gt;But if rates stay high the impact tends to be about a 100 bps decrease in growth of cash flow per share as debt rolls. Unfortunate, but not dominant. &gt; &gt;It is REIT stock market returns that have lagged. It has been a stock-pickers market, and one in which I've made good money by knowing the details.","Actually, I think residential REITs are the largest industry. However, you're right that REITs that are for office space or retail (especially malls) have been struggling pretty bad. The industrial REITs are doing quite well, as are the more specialized REITs (especially the few data center REITs).",Retail is also doing poorly.
investing,Aug,1eyb6oz,Parents paying 4% fee on mutual fund with TD,"Just found out for over 15 years my parents have been paying 4% fee yearly, for a mutual fund holding.  It has a guarantee that you would never lose more than HALF of your investment (which is useless guarantee since a chunk of the fund is in low vol assets with low returns)  This was sold by a TD waterhouse advisor.  The fund returned 4% per year on average over the past 15 years, after the fee.  from 2009 to present, the s&amp;p500 went up roughly 850% where their investment is only up roughly 90%.  I feel like a 4% fee should be illegal, and seems they have made money whether the investment is up or down, and when they make it when its down it hinders the upside in the following years significantly.  Question is, can they be sued? my parents were taken to the wringer on this. I am furious.","Funds with downside protection tend to have high fees, because they have to purchase options to hedge against risks, to ensure they can meet their promise. In the case of this fund, it would mean needing to purchase various put options against the fund's assets in case it does drop.  if the fund returned 4% after fees, then it probably wasn't in low volatility/low risk assets, because it returned 8% before fees.  That being said, your parents would be better off building a low risk portfolio. 40% equities 60% bonds should make it extremely unlikely it loses more than 50% of its value, but should still provide a better return than the fund after fees.","is this ilegal. Can I sue?  No you cannot sue. I can ask for any ammount of money I want to manage your wealth, it is your fault if you accept.","Idk where you got the 4%? Not familiar with these funds.  It's possible the fund could be making excessive profits off the fees, but you can't just compare it to the S&amp;P500. Your benchmark would really be a 60:40 stock/bond portfolio, because the fund's assets seems to be 60% stocks 40% bonds.  Benchmark for a 60:40 portfolio the last 10 years is about 6% returns.  Also worth considering its a Canadian fund, and the Canadian index has not done as well as the S&amp;P500","I don't think it's fair to compare their portfolio to the S&amp;P500 unless their fund had a similar level of volatility  You might find another fund with a similar level of volatility, and I think you'd find the returns closer to 4-6% a year  my 401k was in a target date fund, for example, that only gave me 33% in five years. Doesn't mean I can sue the 401k for giving me a default low-risk investment...it's my fault for not knowing   basically, I have no idea if you \*can\* sue. but do you truly feel they got significantly less than they paid for, in the form of low risk gains? If not, then maybe you \*shouldn't\*",Thanks. I didnt realize thats how they protected the downside.  the assets in the fund wouldn't even have a 50% correction if the spx did. guess theyve been hedging with puts over the past 15 years in case we have a 1929 crash!  one of the funds i could find was mgf1165c and the TD site says it only has a  MER of 1.59% yet they charged 4%? there are 2 others like this  another one is tdg921c and that one says 3% on their website. which is what they charge for that one.,If OP's parents are from Canada I don't see the issue.,My opinion:  A limited downside fund is kinda sorta like insurance.  We all hope the insurance we purchase is a waste.  No one wants to make a claim.  Same for downside funds.  We do it because we are afraid of what happens if we don't.  The opportunity cost is irrelevant to folks who have no understanding of it.,I am 48 and tried to explain to my parents I could manage their shit as well as Edward Jones... Who is taking 4.7 also... Here are your bonds Dad...,"There are investment type products like annuities for instance, which give you a ‚Äúcap rate‚Äù on return, while also minimizing downside risk. For instance, there‚Äôs some right now that give a cap rate of 9.5% for 7 years , but if the market goes down, you lose nothing and keep your principal. These are very niche and specific investment products used to hedge and protect principal. Often times it‚Äôs older folks to preserve their investments without any downside risk. So you can‚Äôt compare it to the s&amp;p. However, the client (your parents) should be fully aware of these and understand the entire strategy.","It's really disgusting, predatory behavior. They're essentially just stealing money from unsuspecting people who think they're doing the right thing with their retirement. They're lucky to have a kid like you educating them. Obviously they can't get the time and money back, but can start making lemonade with what they have left. It does beg the question whether things like this actually should be allowed to exist. It'd be one thing if they sunk their teeth into those sp500 gains, they've almost assured the fund will grow to a crawl at best, and siphon off their fees accordingly."
investing,Aug,1ele0gw,What should Apple do to replace the money they get from Google?,"It is looking like the US DOJ no longer thinks it is OK for Google to pay Apple to be the default search engine on iOS, MacOS, etc.  The most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.  You then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.  Obviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.  I believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.

The advisor should be aware of the upcoming RMD and it needs to be taken out of the account by December 31st. It can be moved into a brokerage account and you won‚Äôt be able to move it into the irrevocable trust it will need to be a new account. There is a formula that calculates the RMD amount.","In the United States, Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) must typically be taken by December 31 each year, starting in the year you turn 73 (for those who reach age 73 after December 31, 2022, due to changes made by the SECURE Act 2.0). However, for your first RMD, you have the option to delay the distribution until April 1 of the year following the year you turn 73. If you choose to delay the first RMD until April 1, you‚Äôll need to take two RMDs in that year: one by April 1 and another by December 31.

A lot of the document deals with trusts and beneficiaries.   For me page 6, ""When Must You Withdraw Assets?(Required Minimum Distributions)"" was the starting point.  Also page 2 mentions that the custodian of the IRA must provide a report by Jan. 31 of the year the RMD is required, which notifies you and RMD and offer to calculate it for you.  The upside of the document is that they have some worked examples that point you to what tables should be used to determine the RMD percentage.

Happy to hear thoughts!","In the short run it is a voting machine, in the long run it is a weighing machine.  Consider reading [The Intelligent Investor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligent_Investor).","Not exactly.  First off, a stock is a part of a business. It's tangible. If you go out there in the world and you give $400 (40% of the total starting capital) to your cousin to start a bakery; legally, you own 40% of it and the future of the bakery in proportion of 40%. **(stock is literally a part of a business)**  Months pass, and the bakery makes more and more money and your cousin buys more assets, builds another building, gets more employees and now, in total, the bakery owns $10,000 worth in assets (you own 40% of those legally), so now your worth is $4000. **(stock grows as the business grows**)  You get bored from it and you decide to sell a stock. Player B comes at you and wants to buy your stock because he saw how much the company grew and he wants to have a say in the future of this company. Mind you that he doesn't necessarily buy it to resell it, but he also can buy it and use the stock as collateral for borrowing, to get dividends from it, etc. - and that's what he does, he keeps getting dividends from the stock. **(rational valuation of the stock**)  At this point, there comes Player C which really really loves the business and because of this emotional aspect he is ready to offer a 20% price above the asset value to Player B. Player B is tempted by this 20% premium, so he sells the stock to player C. **(subjective valuation of the stock)**  At this point, the initial value of the stock grew by 1020%, the 1000% because there was a real business growth and the 20% because there was a stock market premium paid on it. More people see this growth and they think that the company will continue to either grow or others will come to buy the stock, so they also buy. (**growth and expected growth)**  The more demand is for a stock, then the higher the price at which you can sell it because you feel how people are desperate for it. But this is not bad, this is basically what economics is and liberty of contracts. The value of sugar in the supermarket is based on supply and demand, the price TVs also supply and demand, and so on. This price has to be above the costs of making that service or building this profit. Now, in stocks there is no such cost, but let's say that if the company has worth $100 assets/per stock, and the stock is sold at $90, then your basically getting $10 gifted. It's like buying a car that can be sold tomorrow for $1,000 guaranteed at a price of $900. So it's the same for stocks, their value starts from a point where all market participants agree: it can't cost less than the value of the company's assets (**demand and supply/value of the stock/what if stock doesn't grow with the business)**  There is a value surrounding the market, but the stocks go to those that will appreciate them more i.e. that are willingly to pay more for them (at least, that's what a rational seller will aim to achieve, no?). Because there is a surplus of capital in the markets, stocks' price benchmark gets elevated quite high - pure demand. The stock stops to grow precisely when there are no more buyers for it, at which point the stock stops to grow and when some realize this and start to sell, there is fear of losing money an others follow it with the selling - and so on and so on. Read a bit about the economic/credit cycle/inflation to understand how the stock market is tied to an economy's purchasing power (paragraph touching **bubbles**)  Generally this is the foundation and story on how the market works. If it's confusing, read it again and you'll realize how it is full of legal and economic foundations all of this, and how, the fact that it's a casino is a misconception. It's not as intuitive because to understand the rationale behind the stock market it requires some economic, finance, history and legal foundation.  The fact that the markets are irrational and look like a casino is precisely because it's open to everybody and many people don't have the education to understand how it works, so there tens to be discrepancies because they act irrational. Which is the reality. (paragraph touching the **efficient market hypothesis/non-efficient market hypothesis**).  Preferably you should read more to understand it. As I said, it's not intuitive, only with proper education you start to grasp it. I emphasized in **bold** very simple how the market is a combination of many of those broader topics that I touched. You can read about them and dig deeper if you really want to educate yourself.",Have you ever heard of an investor named Warren Buffett?,Warren Buffett is in the general population. What point are you trying to prove?,"To add, the idea that you're discussing is mostly a Hedge Fund-oriented investing and asymmetrical information in the market.   But if you read what I said, a stock is a part of a business. Bad news tend to push stocks down because there is a loss for the business that will impact revenue: Lawsuit/loss of brand reputation/antitrust/etc.,  it's not exactly gambling, there are some people that just anticipate that others will react the same as them (sell) and they may sell the stock firsts (which also makes sense business-wise because it means that revenue/profit may be lower).  Now, if you think the business is good (again, read what I said in the long comment), would you really think that the business will get into bankruptcy due to some bad news? haha no, very rare, so the correct ""evaluation"" of the impact of some bad news is an estimation for the speculator because you're playing with a future. The accurate impact will be seen on the next financial report, but your action - betting that it will be bad/better - leads you to speculate (thay's why some stocks raise or fall becuause they ""Beat/didn't beat earnings estimate"", meaning that people were gambling on its earnings outcome)  However, all of this doesn't change the fact that the stock is a part of a business (can't emphasize this enough). So saying that the stock market is a casino is like saying that Joe, your neighbour, who is a mechanic will start a car mechanic shop in town, so he is gambling because he can make it either big or lose big (but it isn't, because the difference between gambling and not is the participant approach to it, so for the retail investors, sure, the stock markets feels like a gamble, for the institutional ones it's very rational - I can make story here about how retail investors destroyed the market as we knew it, because in 1970-1990s almost all Hedge Funds could easily deliver consistently 20% returns, but now it's impossible because of Vanguard and other retail investors inflating stock prices to the point where there is divergence in valuation and price i.e. how extremely high P/E are becoming the ""norm"").  Anyway, the volatility you see in stock prices is because the stock is full of retail and uneducated people attaching themselves to it (NVDA, GME, TESLA), but in plenty other areas the market is quite an accurate portrayal of the business.",Probably the same % that you would expect from luck.

investing,Aug,1euowuo,Abaxx Technologies (ABXX/ABXXF) - The New Billion Dollar ICE/CME?,"**TLDR:** 73x in 3-4 years. Abaxx mentioned they are targeting 1 million contracts traded daily at a average revenue of 5 million per day in the medium term based on their latest investor call. At 250 trading days and 80% ownership of the exchange, the exchange would be worth 20 billion USD. Abaxx currently trades at 274 million USD.  Been following the company for the past 4 years so can answer any question that pops up. There is so much more but had to cut out stuff or it gets to long.  **What is It?**  Its a new physically delivered commodities¬†[Exchange and Clearinghouse](https://www.abaxx.exchange/)¬†trying to pick up the slack where ICE and CME are failing. ICE and CME care more about launching financially settled commodities then they care about addressing the need for physically delivered commodities. Why do they do financially settled instead of physically delivered? Because its easy and they are lazy.  Abaxx launched their physically settled LNG contract as well as their REDD+ and Corsia carbon contracts on June 28th of this year. They are working hard to build the volumes right now and connecting major trading companies and banks.  Currently there is 22 integrations working in the background onboarding with Abaxx Exchange is found at the bottom with special mention to StoneX, Mizuho, and JP Morgan. They also have 4 ISV partners. Its a big list and the CEO indicated they are onboarding several more banks in the following quarters.  All of this is important to highlight they have mass industry acceptance of their new LNG contract which they have been building for the last couple years. They had the help of 100 plus companies in building it.  **LNG Contract and how valuable is it?**  To first give you a perspective of how valuable a contract is, the WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil contract generates 320 million in revenue for the NYMEX. The Brent crude oil generates ICE 293 million. When you apply a nice 20x multiple to it, you can start to see how they contracts are valued at the billions.  LNG is only expected to grow from here. Canada will finish 7 LNG export facilities by 2030 on the west coast with the first one finishing next year. They will be able to export up to 50.3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG which translates to 261,560 Abaxx contracts (10,000 MMBTUs).    If you assume they trade 50x each (a reasonable value) and trade the physically delivered Abaxx LNG contract, that would generate 117 million in revenue for Abaxx just from the new Canadian LNG export facilities by 2030. This is only one piece of the pie.  Josh Crumb the CEO has said the¬†[biggest energy/LNG portfolio firms all agree](https://x.com/JoshCrumb/status/1816478661530292694)¬†Abaxx is right with their LNG contract. Which they have been developing for years using their input.  **Carbon Contracts**  Abaxx has two carbon contracts. Corsia and Redd+ contracts which are currently available for trading.  I will point again to the potential value of the Carbon contracts in the DCF here:¬†[DCF Analysis](https://x.com/James_Duade/status/1745905109496717460)  ICE competitor actually¬†[suspended trading](https://www.qcintel.com/carbon/article/ice-confirms-suspension-of-dec24-corsia-phase-one-contract-27404.html)¬†of one of their Corsia contracts due to a short squeeze and their lack of deliverable supply. While Abaxx Corsia contract continues to¬†[push on and is backed by deliverable supply](https://x.com/JoeRaia5/status/1816840923449380967)  **End To End Commodity Tracking with Minehub**  Abaxx [announced a partnership](https://minehub.com/abaxx-and-minehub-announce-strategic-partnership-to-transform-commodities-markets/) with Minehub to create end to end commodity tracking. Minehub platform is extremely sticky as companies that use Minehub will become selling points as all their partners need to be onboarded. This will allow commodities to be mined and tracked on Minehub for their emissions characteristics. Then they can be transported and sold on the exchange for a premium since the emissions data can be proven. Currently its a black box on other exchanges. Cobalt mined in Africa using child labour sells for the same price as Cobalt mined in Canada. It also be able to prove the source of the commodities which will be [required by 2027 for the EU ](https://x.com/stooonkMan/status/1823449492714095038)and currently being required by Canada to combat slavery.   With the Minehub and Abaxx partnership, there will be end to end supply chain tracking of a commodity through the cycle of its life. From being mined in the ground, to being transported and sold on an exchange, to be smelted and refined, and then converted to end use products which are then imported and used across the EU and Canada.  **The Team**  The team is stacked with people from Goldman Sachs, Nymex and CME. In fact Joe Raia, the Chief Commercial Officer previously helped Clearport and created over 2000 different financial products for them. Jeff Currie is on the board and was the global head of commodities research and strategy at Goldman Sachs. Dan McElduff¬†is also Former senior director at NYMEX Natural Gas and Clearport.  The team knows what they are doing since they have done it before.  **Current Investors**  Abaxx is supported by investments from Blackrock, Wellington, CBOE Global Markets, Canoe Financial, Robert Friedland and many more.  **ID++ and Some Speculation (Amazon?)**  Not much is known about ID++ which is Abaxx's propriety technology. There have been hints towards Amazon being a partner as the CEO makes references to a hyper-scaler signing an NDA and [Amazon also mentions ID++](https://www.performancemarketingworld.com/article/1863634/id++-amazon-planning-its-own-post-cookie-solution) in their job postings.  What is known is that its digital identity that allows you to give partial access to a portion of your identity to companies for their use in things such as KYC. It grants you access to platforms by verifying who you are without allowing the company to store things such as passwords which is always at risk of being leaked. ID++ is used in the Abaxx Exchange and by traders onboarding. The exchange is highly regulated by Singapore so this is properly done and not thrown together.  What does this mean? All of your trades you make on the platform is tied to your ID++ identity. What is also important though is your ID++ identity is also tied to the clearinghouse which has a ledger of your current assets. This will allow the clearinghouse to settle your trades¬†**instantly**¬†in comparison to the days required on all the other exchanges.  I want you to picture now that when Abaxx launches their physically delivered Gold contract (which is being worked on), your physically delivered Gold is stored in a partner vault in Singapore. Which is tied to your id++. Now each of your trades is instantly settled, and instantly delivered. This also now allows you to make trades on the exchange using your Gold as collateral, separate from the monetary system. This will unlock vasts amounts of liquidity as you can store your gold but also make trades against your gold. This is just one example of how ID++ can unlock huge amounts of liquidity that CME or ICE cannot currently do. It also unlocks digital tokenization of commodities which is also massive.  I would also mention Abaxx is also working on the technology that allows the tracking of commodities through their life cycle from being mined to being sold. Cobalt mines in Canada using fair wages should not have to compete with mines in the Congo using child workers. In the current markets, there is no grading of the cobalt. Abaxx will eventually begin of physically delivered grades of commodities that can be graded on how ethically it was mined and how clean it was mined.  Whats the point? Essentially Abaxx is a new exchange and clearinghouse that was built from the ground up to support this new revolutionary technologies in the Commodity space. Instant settlement, tokenized commodities, commodity grading, to verified identity. This isn't some simple new exchange.  **Market Cap and Where its Traded?**  Abaxx is traded OTC at ABXXF and in Canada as ABXX on the CBOE Canada exchange. Also trading in Frankfurt. The listing isn't the greatest since many companies can't traded OTC stocks and the CBOE Canada exchange is really small meaning it doesn't get picked up on many radars. But that presents an opportunity for you.  Market Cap is 375 Million CAD. Its competitors all trade in the 10+ Billion USD range. So there is clearly so much room to grow as Abaxx begins launching contracts that ICE/CME cannot do with their technology stack.  List as promised. Quite big for a new exchange. They have clearly put in the legwork.  **Clearing Members:**  * **KGI Securities** * **StoneX**  **Clearing Firms**  * **Marex** * **Mizuho** * **Straits Financial**  **Execution Brokers**  * **Eagle Commodities** * **Evolution Markets** * **KGI Securities** * **Salamander Broking** * **SSY** * **Straits Financial** * **TP ICAP** * **Vanir Global Markets** * **Venture Commodities** * **ADM** * **Dorman Trading** * **EDF Man** * **Gain Capital** * **Ironbeam** * **JP Morgan** * **Philip Futures** * **Wedbush**  **ISV Partners**  * **CQG** * **Trading Technologies** * **FIS** * **Ion**",The only issue with physically settled futures is that it's naturally going to discourage speculators since we have no desire to take delivery. Most futures investors are not hedgers or producers and prefer financially settled because it removes delivery risk.  It's going to make growth harder (but of course everyone trades physically settled stuff on cboe and cme with no real issue) I'm just saying.  I'll check the liquidity on Monday.,Nice write up. Cheers.,"&gt; Sounds interesting and early  Why are you pretending to just come across this, when you have comments about Abaxx going back years?  https://old.reddit.com/r/Abaxx/comments/uujruo/deleted_by_user/i9i3iwq/","Where are the shares listed, how do I buy?","That thought is why alot of companies approached Abaxx to launch the Nickel contract later this year. CME literally refused them because its too much work.  Abaxx is willing to work with these companies to meet demand and build relationships. The problem with financially settled contracts don't actually address any needs. JKM is the Japanese financially settled contract but if you actually need to buy or deliver LNG its useless. They need to do OTC deals which take time and are inefficient. Abaxx has huge industry support to launch this LNG product and it meets a massive need and demand. As Abaxx grows a foothold, JKM traders might as well play blackjack with each other since the JKM price has no basis in reality if its not attached to a physically delivered commodity.","I should say, they can always launch a financial futures based off their current physically delivered contract. Abaxx could suck the liquidity from JKM and kill it dead in the water for having a superior product and producers/buyers that actually use it for physically deliver products. Its a more real price on which to trade","WTI and Henry Hub are both physically delivered and Brent has an EFP option.   That doesn‚Äôt stop the speculative trading on any of them. All that matters is open interest. If speculative interest (those that have no interest in taking delivery) forms, they just close their open interest and roll it to the next month. Less than 5% of contracts traded on those physical contracts goes to delivery.   Physical delivery is what forces convergence with spot price. If no one is taking delivery, what does the contract even represent? It‚Äôs the requirement to close out your position or take physical delivery that forces the contract to converge. Otherwise, what‚Äôs to stop the contracts from just being a wallstreetsbets level of speculation, completely divorced from reality?",[removed],[removed],This account is 20 days old has only commented about Abaxx

But for that small a loss, you'd probably be better of taking a few years to realize the benefit rather than sell a stock you dont want to sell - $3k a year of that loss can be deducted from regular income.  Alternatively, if you have good reason to sell (other than just the TLH benefit), you could realize just a $7k gain, then that plus the $3k of regular income will offset the $10K loss completely.","You could do that, but even if you did, you only need to sell $7000 of your winners because you can deduct the first $3000 of losses against ordinary income.  If you did not sell any winners, you would still get the full $10,000 deduction, but it would have to be taken over multiple years.","OP this is the best advice, however, to add to this - nothing is stopping you from using this as a chance to reset your cost basis.

Despite widespread recession fears, Palantir reported a 27% year-over-year revenue growth, with net income rising to $134 million from $28 million the previous year. Their operating margin also improved significantly, growing from 2% to 15.5% in Q2. All of this good news has seemingly enpowered bulls but they are disconnected from reality.

As the other person said, at 3% investing is almost certainly better, returns wise. That 3% interest is essentially the guaranteed return on your money: every dollar extra you pay towards a 3% debt is avoiding 3% of interest, so basically 'gaining' 3%. The S&amp;P has historically returned 10+% (over the long-term, with short-term volatility), so even being really conservative you're better (over the long-term) return-wise investing in the S&amp;P with extra dollars vs. paying down 3% debt.  The one nice thing about paying down something like a mortgage, though, is cashflow: it's one less monthly expense you have to worry about. You say you're retired, so if you feel tight/strapped month to month, that relief may be worth it. Generally, though, I'd invest vs. paying down 3% debt.","Don‚Äôt even invest it in the stock market. If you put it in a money market fund, you will literally get 5%+ return. That‚Äôs just free money",why pay off 3% interest? Put it all in the market.  We may never see 3% mortgages again. Why not milk it for as long as possible?,What‚Äôs the interest rate on your mortgage?,It depends on a lot of things the interest rates what is your monthly mortgage.

Also, you've probably already paid the majority of the interest, so it's likely mostly principle that's left. (Mortgage amortization front loads interest)   Take that $220k and create a dividend portfolio. Then take the dividends and apply them to the mortgage. If you can create a fairly conservative 6% apy portfolio, you'll earn approximately $1100/mo. This leaves you $200 extra every month and now your mortgage is free. You can apply that extra money to the principal every month and pay down your mortgage faster or treat your family to a night out once a month without using your Pension money."

I‚Äôm thinking of moving around 20% of my savings into an Icelandic account that offers 8.75% annually. Locally, our savings accounts do 1%-1.5%, while inflation here has averaged over 4% in the past five years, compared to Iceland‚Äôs 5.5%-6% inflation rate. Despite the inflation difference, the higher returns and compounding potential are appealing to me and I would be fine with the risk.   Their bonds also look attractive, with a 9% yield on 2-year bonds, though I might hold off while initially getting started. I‚Äôm also considering investing in Icelandair and perhaps a retail/tourism company, as those sectors have growth pretty well over the past 15 years.

What changed between when you bought it and when it returned to the price you bought it for?  Why would this change how you view it's potential?,"Have a plan. Stick to the plan. There should be no ‚Äúpanic‚Äù there should only be execution.  When I invest in a stock I try my best to time the purchase when the stock has a good chance of moving higher. I use stop losses to lock profits or cut losses. If my intent is a long-term hold, I take partial profits quickly with a tight stop loss and then let the rest ride with a wider stop loss. I raise the stop loss as the stock advances. If the investment is really working, I will use a longer time frame to determine where to put the stop loss.  In your example, I would never allow a 44% profit to evaporate. By then I would have taken partial profits. If the stock reverses and heads lower, my stop loss will eventually be hit to seal the remainder of profits. It may well be quite a bit below the 44% profit if my outlook is longer-term, but that is life in the stock market.

You could also do a combination of the two.  The easiest way to do it is probably to rebalance inside a tax-advantaged (preferably pre-tax) account once or twice a year to your desired allocation.","Selling a chunk of stocks or buying bonds over time until you reach your desired allocation will both work depending how often or how quickly you want to rebalance your portfolio.

I don't see the benefit other than pure laziness or intentional ignorance.,Sell stocks you own for bonds. It‚Äôs called reallocation,"In a taxable account selling will trigger taxes.  How much in dividends are you claiming each year?  You could stop dividend reinvestment and take the money in cash, and use it to buy bonds.",[removed],This.  I just ran a bunch of scenarios with market returns going back to 1929. Basically there are only a few years where bonds helped. In basically every case more than 30% bonds provides worse outcomes as you give up too much returns and retirement really isn‚Äôt a short term need.

investing,Aug,1eumh0k,Why people incorporate bonds in their portfolios,[removed],"-Risk is defined as exposure to volatility   -The value of bonds are sufficiently uncorrelated to the performance of the stock market¬†   ¬†Both of these assumptions, common in academic finance, fail to a meaningful extent in practical reality.¬†¬†   ¬†Volatility is not risk. Risk is likelihood of permanent capital impairment, which prevents you from achieving your goals. Path dependency on the way to an outcome is irrelevant if you have no liquidity needs and your assets are not going to get wiped out to 0. Over a 20-30 year period, who cares if I experience more volatility if I'm compounding at 10%+? I'd argue volatility is the price of achieving excess returns and should be welcomed, not viewed as some proxy of risk and thus minimized.¬† As for the correlation point, this is both less true than often stated (just observe crisis periods when correlations go to 1.0) and, for the needs of long term investors, not very relevant for the same path dependency reason cited above. A 100% bond portfolio for a young investor planning for eventual retirement is astonishingly risky, because they probably won't achieve their goal. It's not somehow ""low risk"" just the squiggly lines don't squiggle up and down as much as other assets do.","I love the OP‚Äôs post, AND I agree with your take on risk.   EX: Cash, and I mean ‚Äòreal‚Äô cash within the US for example, NOT cash invested in a MF or HYSA, is extremely low in volatility and extremely high in risk as a long term (10 years or more) holding.","Yeah, of course those assumptions are arguable. And of course it won‚Äôt be attractive for some people‚Äôs investment approach.   The information is still valuable in that it provides information on how volatility is not directly linked to expected return and that balancing a portfolio in different ways allows for similar returns with less volatility exposure.

investing,Aug,1ennzti,When to sell bonds instead of stocks for expenses? ,"I am retired and have almost all of my savings in stock and stock funds. I sell stocks for my expenses. I have a bond ladder to use when stocks are down. My question, which I don't think has a solid answer but want to hear others' opinions, is when to use the bond ladder. Say we're in a situation in which stocks are down for the quarter but up for the year, use bonds or stocks? It seems with a long enough timeline, stocks are always up.",Pick the allocation you want based on your risk tolerance and stick to it. There's no reason why your stocks going down in value should change that,[removed],"Any investor should have a good idea of the ratio between stocks and bonds based on their risk tolerance.  Figure that out first, then sell in a way that moves towards it and/or maintains it.  As a retiree your risk tolerance should probably start low, increasing with the amount you have to work with.  If you anticipate leaving other people with an inheritance then you can probably be more risky with it.","So a lot can depend on other factors in my opinion.  * We dont know, maybe you are retired but own a passive business that has income, maybe you own rental properties with income, maybe you have a pension, maybe you have royalties, maybe you have differed annuities.  We dont know the percent of your baseline survival level income if any comes from social security. Each of these could influence the answer. * Lets assume you worked only under the table and have a 100% stock portfolio.  Next issue is we dont know how big it is, followed immediately by what fixed expenses you have and your yearly cost of living.  How much is discretionary, how much is mandatory expenses? * We dont know how many years the bond ladder is, what the bonds pay, or what percent of your expenses could be covered by them.  * We dont know what types of accounts the bonds sit in.  There are many correct ways to think about retirement but the question is deceptively simple because the situation could vary drastically.  Its actually not an investing question.  Its a financial planning and retirement question.","Your bond ladder is a valuable tool for generating income and managing risk However, it's essential to remember that bonds also fluctuate in price, especially when interest rates change","&gt; Like, if you bought in '29 and held, you would have been break even in 1959.  These kinds of arguments are not compelling because this is not how normal people invest.","OK, for an investor who is continually contributing and building their savings that makes sense.  But if someone is retired and no longer making contributions,  don't you think those down periods are a heightened concern?  I guess you're making the case to continually put money into equities.  Even in the wealth preservation years.","Fair point, which is why conventional wisdom is to rebalance your distribution of stocks vs. bonds to progressively favour the latter as you approach retirement.  But the original example still isn't valid as nobody lump-sums their entire life savings in to the market on the day they retire (hopefully).","Going to be generous and ignore the ridiculous pre- and post-amble and just stick to your specific arguments.  &gt; 1) ""normal people"" flock to the market when it goes up and flee when it tanks and then never return. It's well documented.  That's nice. Do normal people lump-sum their entire net worth in to the market on one conveniently selected day and then wait until they break even? Because that's the counter-point you offered.  &gt; 2) The ""dollar cost average"" strategy didn't exist until 1949 when it was introduced by Benjamin Graham in his book ""The Intelligent Investor""  That's nice. It is, however, fairly bog-standard investment advice for the present. I assume I don't need to explain to you that nobody is lump-summing in to the 1929 market in 2024 either, right? And that we're discussing the historical performance of strategies?  &gt; 3) Your strategy assumes ""normal people"" have no time sensitivity and unlimited money to spend on stocks.  No, I'm assuming normal people have a time horizon &gt; 4 years and make consistent monthly contributions.  I'd go through the rest of your post point-by-point but it would make us both dumber and I don't think you have a lot of wiggle-room there. Feel free to respond with an actual critique and I'm happy to respond.","I haven't run formal analysis on this.  My uniformed position is that if stocks are less than 10% off their all-time highs, then pull from stocks.  Other wise, pull from bonds.  Replenish the bond ladder when the stocks get back to within 10% of ATHs."
investing,Aug,1eremcy,What is happening to BOXX right now?,"I keep most of my non-invested cash in the BOXX etf, from Alpha Architects. My understanding was that it uses box spreads to capture the current risk-free return rate of the market as capital gain, instead of paying out dividends.  So why it has slightly (but significantly) dipped a couple of days ago, and why has it now announced a special dividend which will be paid out tomorrow?  This violates everything I knew about this etf and if I am being honest it made me freak out a little. I am thinking of selling right after the special dividend is paid out but I am not sure.","Because it uses actively managed box spread options and we have experienced a significant bout of volatility.  They are required to distribute gains as they occur if they cant use creation and redemption units to match.  Id never use something like this for cash given its investment style, especially with a firm that has a 5 year ETF success ratio of 17% according to Morningstar and below average process and parent rankings.  Why not use actual T Bill ETF if you want tax efficiency rather than a leveraged equity options strategy that is seeking to mimic the 1-3 month T bIll.  This is not a safe ETF by any stretch.  Edit:  someone wrote an article calling this bullshit out and warning people 5 months ago lol https://www.taxnotes.com/featured-analysis/tax-trap-inside-boxx/2024/03/08/7j8x0  I bet the next article out about this ETF is a class action lawsuit, fund closure, and a tax bomb for everyone who holds it.",The distribution from BOXX is a capital gain.

It's right on the web site  - [https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/boxetf/#distributions](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/boxetf/#distributions)  The fund looks to be behaving as advertised.  The real question is whether section 1256 straddle rules apply and it doesn't look like the IRS has challenged it.  I guess I don't really understand why people are getting worked up over it.,&gt;... actively managed box spread options and we have experienced a significant bout of volatility.¬†  That is unture and it is not a real risk with a box spread.  A box spread is a vol and delta neutral position. Volatility is not a factor in a box spread.  All my long box spreads were totally fine.  Tax efficiency on a box spread is very different than a t-bill ETF.  I bet OP is outside the US - for people that don't have to pay taxes on capital gains - a box spread is much more tax efficient than treasury ETFs.  And for US based investors - the section 1256 treatment can also be preferred since interest from a t-bill is taxed at ordinary income rates.,I think I am just going to move to SGOV,"My understanding is boxx is supposed to give you capital gains appreciation, not income.  Its the whole point.  Looking back, its never paid a dividend before.","Realized capital gains also have to be distributed. That is completely standard.    The question you should ask is why was BOXX unable or unwilling to wash out these capital gains without realizing them through the commonly used ETF creation redemption mechanism, aka heartbeat trades.",I noticed this too and it's a unsettling because avoiding tax inefficient dividends was the whole reason to hold this etf.  Is there a link to where they announced the dividend?,Prices of any asset\* always drop on ex div date by the amount of the dividend.    ^(*except for money market funds and similar which prorate by share ownership duration),[deleted],"The short term capital gains distributions are the issue.  My understanding is this is the first time a distribution happened.  What I wanted to know does this mean from now on, it will operate this way or did something unusual happen?  When I purchased the fund, I wanted zero distributions as that's how it was presented to me.    A 60/40 capital gains distribution is still somewhat better than ordinary income with Treasuries, but the deferral was what I was more interested in."

SPY for example trades around $30 billion per day so your billionaire friend would have no problem establishing a position of $1 billion.","There is a huge difference between Coke and an ETF  Coke has a fixed number of shares at any given time, an ETF doesn't  If an ETF's price gets slightly higher than the net asset value (NAV) of its holdings then authorized participants will come in and create new ETF units which will have the effecting of pushing the price back down to NAV.  Except in outlier cases, an ETF should track its NAV pretty closely because if it doesn't then authorized participants will come in an arbitrage the difference.","You go through a large financial institution. They use algos that hide your intentions as much as possible. There are algorithms that can simple slice the order up and time it, but more likely you‚Äôd use an algorithm that tracks the trading volume and adjusts its slices based on that. This way you buy as much as you can without sticking your head out in the open.   That combined with dark pools can hide your intentions. You may still make the price move regardless if volume isn‚Äôt very high, simple supply and demand would come into play. What you don‚Äôt want is to let others see what you‚Äôre doing or else they can take advantage and cost you more.

OP didn't specify",Yea daily vol for spy is 41m that's 20b a day,"Mostly correct, but also missed a big part of the picture, which is that ETFs can be traded with market makers who can literally create new units, quite often within the on screen bid-ask as well¬†  Source: I also do these kinds of trades several times a month","Shares of etfs can be created though by authorized groups. The volume into the etf matters less than the underlying. Thus buying 100% of the daily volume of spy wont matter that much because its a small % of daily spx all stocks volume. You‚Äôd pay a very slight premium on the etf share creation, perhaps 1-5 bps tops.","Ok I see what you are saying, you are making the case that a $1B purchase will move the actual S&amp;P500 index, not just move the SPY ETF  Sorry but I disagree for either S&amp;P500 or Nasdaq 100, $1B isn't enough to move either unless they deliberately do it in a telegraphed/clumsy way.       There is so much money tied to each index, not just in terms of the market cap of the underlying stocks but also all the derivative plays (options, futures).    These are huge very liquid markets  For a smaller/specialty ETF, sure they could definitely move the underlying shares"
investing,Sep,1fkja91,Everything I've ever learned from /r/investing,"Read this book:¬†[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\_Random\_Walk\_Down\_Wall\_Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street)  Use this reddit flowchart:¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gdlu9/how\_to\_prioritize\_spending\_your\_money\_a\_flowchart/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gdlu9/how_to_prioritize_spending_your_money_a_flowchart/)  Sear this stat into your brain: 94.8% of actively managed funds (by all those smart Ivy League people who study all those graphs and look at all those monitors) [underperform the market over 20 years](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/business/stock-market-2022.html).  Why are the finance folks so rich then? They get paid a percentage of the money they manage in addition to a slice of the profits. Their main business is convincing investors to give them money to manage, making gains is literally a bonus. Also, it is totally possible to beat the market in the short-term, but you never know how short it will be.  The market will stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid. Markets do not respond to news the way you think they will. All seemingly good arguments are made retroactively, and all the bad predictions are forgotton.  People make predictions all the time. You only remember the people who got it right. Classic survivorship bias.  Time in the market beats timing the market.  Don't invest any money you might need in the next 5 years.  Start moving your money into more conservative investments when you're 10 years out from retirement, as the worst shocks can take 7-8 years to recover.  Since 1926, [the market was at an all-time high for 30% of the months](https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/scared-of-investing-when-the-stock-market-is-at-an-all-time-high-you-shouldn-t-be/). All time highs are not indicators you should not invest because as long as the all time high is still lower than the 20 year-later point when you take out your money, you're still going to gain.  It's okay to invest short-term and in individual stocks and in Crypto. Just know that it's gambling and not investing. Imagine I told you that there was a stock that I could GUARANTEE will give you a 49% chance of increasing by over 100% in the next HOUR, but only if you invest right now, would you take it? It's a great offer right? Yup. It exists. It's called ""black"" or ""red"" in Roulette, and it's available in literally every casino.  Keep it as simple as possible. The more complex you make it the more you think your decisions have control over short-term outcomes, the more likely you are to be tempted to move the money around. Whatever will help you ""set it and forget it"" will likely yield more gains in the long term than any short-term maximization.  It is not guaranteed that large cap US index funds will continue to rise in value forever, but it is basically guaranteed that they will be correlated to the US Economy. If you believe that the US Economy will grow and continue to be an international linchpin, if you believe that US laws will continue to favor large corporations and mechanism to make rich people more rich, and if you think the US won't get into a war on home soil they can't win, then large cap US index funds have the highest risk/return ration of a bet as you can make. Otherwise, you can invest in a world index.  Okay, that's everything I've ever learned on every thread from¬† r/investing and r/personalfinance ¬†- I posted this as a comment in another thread, but I figured I make it it's own post, in case others want to chime in on their main takeaways during their time lurking here.     EDIT Adds:   - [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/s/p8Q5lErAY7](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/s/p8Q5lErAY7) Flowchart   - 1% in fees, in a year where you got 10% in gains is actually 10%-11% of your gains put into fees. In a year where you earned 5%, 1% in fees eats up 20% of your gains. [Over 40 years, a 1% fee eats up a third or your retirement.](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/How_much_do_you_lose_to_annual_fees_after_many_years%3F)  EDIT:  The most interesting investing scam thought experiment I read about that helped me understand how strong survivorship bias is, is one where the scammer put out an ad for an email list for free stock tips. He got thousands of people. He spilt the email list in half and told half of them to buy, and half of them to sell. The half for whom his prediction was correct, he emailed the next week, and he did the same thing. After 5 times of this, he ended up with a couple hundred people who believed this man to be a stock picking genius: 5 in a row, correct every time, with all the analytics and charts and historical reasoning to back it up. So at this point, they were knocking his door down to give him money to invest for them. Even after he got money, he used the same technique, and after 5 more splits, he ended up with 20 people for whom he had been right 10 times in a row and made them more money than they'd ever had with another investor. So they put their whole lifesavings with him.  The thing about picking stocks is that you can often be the scammer and the mark.  EDIT 2: Spelling","I read this book in 2005. The sections on the South Seas and Dutch Tulip bubbles were fascinating. Of course, it didn't stop me from buying into one of the largest property bubbles of all time a year later.","&gt;The market will stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid.

Anyone who bought real estate before the crash of 08/09 and hasn‚Äôt sold is sitting pretty good right now.,"&gt;Sear this stat into your brain: 94.8% of actively managed funds (by all those smart Ivy League people who study all those graphs and look at all those monitors) underperform the market over 20 years.  This is largely misunderstood. A passive investor owns an entire index, an active investor owns some portion of that index.  A big reason for this is because the top 1-2% of stocks make up the majority of returns, so the top 5% of investors that pick these winning stocks see the majority of returns, while the 95% that don't lag their returns.  You aren't at a mathematical disadvantage by picking stocks, you're just taking on additional risk for potential higher rewards. The only actual mathematical loss is the fees.  Best analogy I can make is suppose you have 2 options:   A) Guaranteed $10  B) 5% chance of $100, 95% chance of $5.10  Both of these options are roughly equally valuable, but the first option wins 95% of the time.  Secondly, as more and more money chases indexing, there are more pricing disparities to take advantage of, especially in small cap value. Thus the value of index funds diminishes over time.  &gt;Time in the market beats timing the market.  &gt;Since 1926, the market was at an all-time high for 30% of the months. All time highs are not indicators you should not invest because as long as the all time high is still lower than the 20 year-later point when you take out your money, you're still going to gain.  Since 1926, if the S&amp;P500 earnings yield is lower than both the federal funds rate and 10 year treasury yield, it has been followed by a crash 100% of the time, and trading around this has increased real returns  &gt;It is not guaranteed that large cap US index funds will continue to rise in value forever, but it is basically guaranteed that they will be correlated to the US Economy.   There are economic papers that suggest that economic growth and stock returns aren't that correlated. This is because economic growth can already be priced in, so only unexpected growth affects returns. Additionally, if lots of small businesses are responsible for growth, that would not be captured in ;arge cap returns.  &gt;if you believe that US laws will continue to favor large corporations and mechanism to make rich people more rich, and if you think the US won't get into a war on home soil they can't win, then large cap US index funds have the highest risk/return ration of a bet as you can make. Otherwise, you can invest in a world index.  This is not necessarily true- US stocks are already priced at a premium due to these very advantages.","It is also awful because it is directly contrary to ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose"".",It was definitely not justifying gambling lol. The context showed that gambling is a bad idea,"Pretty good. I'd just add:  ""It's priced in"".",This line is awful. It assumes you are right about a trade despite results showing otherwise.
investing,Sep,1foe95u,Are people vastly misunderstanding the meaning of the rate cuts or am I?,"I keep seeing articles and even posts on here of people saying things such as ""I just inherited 150k, but with the recent rate cuts, should I park this in an HYSA instead?"" meaning they are scared of the stock market because of the rate cuts. Meanwhile I am excited about the rate cuts because they're intended to stimulate the economy and therefore, I expect stock market value to increase. Am I wrong that this is their intention? Sure it may not always play out as intended, but I see this as at least opening the door for stock market to go up. Why is everyone so scared?","It's really a question of whether a recession is coming or not.  When the Fed cuts rates, it is often to prevent the economy from going into recession or trying to get us out of one. The 50 point cut has some believing that the Fed knows the economy is weaker than we think and needs more stimulation, thereby increasing likelihood of a recession.  If we avoid a recession the rate cuts are bullish for the stock market. But we have no way of knowing this, hence the worry.  That said, bull markets ""climb a wall of worry"" and this market still acts very bullish. The more people that park their money in HYSA, the more that money will flow into the stock market as it rises due to FOMO.  It's when nobody is worried and everyone is complacent about the stock market that *I* start to worry...",sentiment analysis (both sympathetic and contrarian) has not produced very successful market predictors.,"Fun story, but he sold everything more due to the fact he was doing significant insider trading.

You're spot on with this.  I remember the financial crisis of 2007-2008.  I went to a Christmas party that had primarily teachers attend (I was not).  They were all bragging about how many homes they owed (some had 30) that they bough with stated-income loans, no money down, etc, etc, and were renting them out and gaining tons of equity.  I knew right then that the market was about to collapse.","To me these rate cuts are meant to keep the economy strong by offering some interest rate relief to borrowers.¬† I think they're cutting because it's safe to do so now, not because they need to mitigate an in progress recession.","Over what time frame? The prediction that ""a recession is coming"" without any kind of timeframe attached to it is useless. Of course it is. The economy is cyclical, so (at least as long as the modern economy exists) there's always going to be a recession looming at some point in the future.  But a whole lot of people were specifically calling for a recession in the immediate wake of Covid, and those people were wrong. That recession did not happen. Sure, we may have a recession tomorrow or next year or five years from now, but that would be a different one than what they were predicting.","People are scared because this is an uncertain time, partly because of the election. If I were scared and didn‚Äôt have many options and also didn‚Äôt need the money I‚Äôd probably put it into an index fund and let it sit there for years",Similar to the story that Joe Kennedy was getting his shoes shined outside his Wall St office in the fall of 1929. The guy shining his shoes gave him some hot stock tips. Kennedy supposedly went into his office and sold everything.,"I think people may get cause and effect mixed up.  If you look at the stock market and rate cuts you might see several instances of rates being cut while the stock market goes down so you might thing ""Hey when rate cuts happen the stock market goes down""  What is happening is the FRB sees weakness in the economy and cuts rates to stimulate the economy ,the stock market sees the same weakness and may fall.  Basically its the Federal reserve cuts rates to stop a recession or sometimes they are too slow and cut rates during a recession  Some people may interpret that as rate cuts cause a recession .

investing,Sep,1fejp13,Why is the $3000 capital loss deduction so low?,"I get you can apply capital losses against capital gains to minimize your taxable gains.  I get there is a carryover where if you take more losses than gains, you can apply those losses against future gains.  I get that there is a $3000 capital loss deduction where if your losses exceed your gains, you can apply $3000 against your ordinary income.    I just don't get why that value is so low.  Like, one year I took over 100k in losses (sounds worse than it was) and I suppose if I never were to have gains, I could just apply it against $3000 in annual income for the next 33 years.  $3000 seems like such a small amount, though.  I asked ChatGPT:  &gt;The **$3,000 capital loss deduction limit** has remained unchanged for individuals since it was established under the **Tax Reform Act of 1976**. Since then, the limit has neither increased nor decreased, even though inflation has eroded its value over time. The limit was originally set at $3,000 to allow taxpayers to offset other income with investment losses, but it has not been adjusted for inflation in the decades since its introduction.  Adjusted for inflation, $3000 in today's dollars would be $16,583.83.    That amount makes a lot more sense to me.   Why hasn't this been increased in decades?",You've answered your own question. It hasn't been adjusted for inflation. Why hasn't the federal minimum wage been raised since 2009? Because it's not adjusted for inflation. To attribute motive beyond that is purely conjecture.,The better question is why any dollar limits are ever passed without an adjustment for inflation enshrined in the law.,[removed],Your form 1040 schedule D will have a summary of losses each year and the carry forwards,"I worked for a tech company that had an IPO. ¬†I had a bunch of shares. ¬†When the stock was fairly high, I sold and started ¬†diversifying by buying other stocks/etfs. ¬†  When rates went up, the tech stocks tanked so I tax loss harvested 150k in losses.¬†  Not everything I bought tanked.

investing,Sep,1fqtnad,Gold bars at Costco - is sale volume due to arbitage play?,"Gold bars have been selling like crazy for the past 1-2 years at Costco.  But gold prices change by the minute whereas the Costco price is fixed for periods of time.    I had wondered why they keep selling out.  I realize that gold has been on the rise recently, but long term (40 years) it gets crushed by the SP500 and the same problem of safe storage continues to exist. I think any serious long or short term investors of gold would just buy the ETF's comprised predominantly of gold bars.  Then you have no storage issues and high liquidity.  Are people just trying to play arbitrage and if the price of gold increases, they'll buy any and all they can at Costco below market price, and just dump it at market to capture the profit margin?  I suppose if gold decreased in value, they could just return it to Costco.  I'm just curious - not considering backing the truck up to Costco :)",Returning your gold because the price drops would be the most Costco thing ever.,It‚Äôs more of a credit card points arbitrage and no shipping costs imo,"Probably why they put an ""All sales final"" clause with gold specifically haha.","Can you explain the points arbitrade process here?

Some people like the thought of owning a physical bar of gold. Same people probably have a decent chunk of cash hidden in their home. These buyers are putting the gold in their home safe and keeping it there for a long time.,"Take a look at r/CostcoPM which has new posts as gold becomes available. For example in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CostcoPM/comments/1fqklr1/1_oz_gold_bar_pamp_suisse_lady_fortuna_veriscan/) gold was selling at above the spot price by $35.69 per ozt, but after the 2% back that the costco executive membership gives, and another 2% back from credit card cashback it was actually selling at a discount of $72.31 per ozt.  I have a place nearby me that buys gold at about 99.5% of spot, so for me that deal is profitable.

investing,Sep,1fcu13v,What would you do if your financial advisor told you this. ,So we recently met with our financial advisor and basically they suggested we do the following:  1) sell both of our properties. One being a rental property that‚Äôs valued at $410k with renters currently (we‚Äôre not making a lot of money off the renters. FYI but they‚Äôre covering the mortgage and we take home make $250)  2) sell our current property that we reside in worth $989k and downsize to a house about 500k   3) allow them to Invest 900k that we have liquid so that in the next 10-15 years that turns into 3million but I really don‚Äôt want to move from my current house. Is there not another reasonable way to make 900k in liquid invest without having to uproot your whole life?,The keyword here is ‚Äúallow THEM‚Äù,Tell them to f off   sound like they just wanna make more commission off of having More of your money,"I have never heard of a financial advisor advocate to sell your primary residence. Either you are in some serious finanical trouble and/or have very lofty, unreasonable financial goals for your age and timeframe.   Whatever, your advisor wants to inveat you in you need to ask for the full breakdown of that package so you can research the actual performance of each stock and fund. You also need to ask for full transparency of your advisor's commissions and his/her company's fees. They may be acting in their best interest and not yours.  Now, for the rental property, that is one area i see people, including my own mother, mess up. People get weird thinking property is wealth. Thing is, it owns you back in maintenance, taxes and insurance. Your potential growth/profit margin on rental income is usually below the investment profit.  Whatever you do, dont just blindly take your advisor 's word. Great if they are honest and really acting as your fiduciary, but there are a lot of dishonest people out there. Read everything and ask questions. Get replies in writing.","Make sure they are a fiduciary which means by law, they must be looking out for your best interest.","Thank you, I will start looking for a fee based","Reddit is such a shit place to get financial advice - how is this the top comment?  Have we considered that OP may not be financially prepared for retirement and the advice around downsizing is to get them there?  Notice how OP asks if there‚Äôs another way to get 900k without uprooting their life?  My wild guess is OP is probably very heavy on housing and light on liquid dollars, and that‚Äôs a recipe for losing your home in retirement.    But since this is Reddit the top take isn‚Äôt asking more questions to better understand the context of OPs situation and what circumstances are driving said advice, it‚Äôs just a kneejerk brain dead take that the advisor has to be wrong and OP should tell em to fuck off lol.   Imagine if someone was stupid enough to be influenced by Reddit, then in 5 years can‚Äôt retire, all because of comments on an anonymous forum largely made by people who wouldn‚Äôt know a Monte Carlo if it hit em in the face lol.","To be fair to the advisor, you haven't told us nearly enough to understand what might've led to those recommendations. For example, if someone has all their savings locked up in home equity, are spending so much on their mortgage that they aren't able to build savings separately, and then tells an advisor they want $3M in 10-15 years, it isn't terribly unreasonable for the advisor to suggest liquidating the home equity in order to move it into stocks along with downsizing to free up income from the primary mortgage payments for continued investments.   People are calling out that the $3M in 10-15 years sounds scammy, but it isn't clear that the advisor actually promised you this number versus they showed you a range or you gave them this number as a target and they built the plan from there or they are including continual cashflow into the investments from the savings on the primary mortgage.","You‚Äôre 100% right, you get on places like Reddit and they treat the fiduciary standard like some god tier qualification and not the absolute bare minimum of decent interaction required by law lol.","Not to be the AKSHUALLY guy but, at least in NY all FA's are required by law to act in the best interest of their clients regardless of training or certification.....so they're all fiduciaries.  Within that even with a certified ""fiduciary"" there's still gray area....like it would be in my clients best interest to be invested in XYZ index fund.  Well there's this option over here or this option where we (the investment firm) have a relationship with the seller and I get something for selling it, the flip side of that is it might be offered to XYZ firm at a slightly lower rate than someone not working with a certain firm can buy it for.  I don't work in the industry anymore but, every time I hear someone say that I think of this.","That last line in OPs question tells me there‚Äôs something more going on here - saying ‚Äúany other way to make 900k‚Äù as if they still know they need the capital.   Wild guess, but if I had a client that over bought and had an expensive house but little in the way of assets my primary advice would 100% be downsize your home and let‚Äôs get this capital to work."

investing,Sep,1ff40k9," It‚Äôs easy to buy gold, how /where do I sell it?","A lot of people talk about how easy it is to buy gold‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs from big retailers like Costco, online dealers, or even local shops. However, once you‚Äôve accumulated gold bars or coins, the big question becomes: how do you sell it, and where?  For example, who buys gold from individuals like us? Is there a marketplace or a network of dealers who are specifically interested in purchasing gold? And how is the selling price determined? I know the gold market has fluctuating spot prices, but does that fully control what you‚Äôll be paid? Are there fees or deductions to expect from the buyer, and if so, how do those typically work?  Another thing I‚Äôm curious about is the process itself. Is selling as straightforward as walking into a shop or dealer with your gold bars, or is it more involved? Do you need certain paperwork or certificates of authenticity to get the best value? For those who‚Äôve gone through it, how was your experience? Were there any surprises, such as the buyer's inspection process or additional costs like testing?  I‚Äôm asking because I‚Äôve heard mixed opinions. Some say the resale market can be a bit tricky due to premiums, buyer fees, and market demand. Others say it‚Äôs as simple as finding a trusted dealer or listing it on a marketplace. I‚Äôm interested in hearing about real experiences from anyone who has sold their gold bars or coins. How did you find a buyer, and was the process smooth or difficult?","Think about what you just said. The supply of gold is plentiful, and dominated by large scale players with legitimacy advantages who their own distribution. The answer to ‚Äúhow do I sell gold?‚Äù is ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt unless you offer a steep discount.‚Äù   The thing about gold is that it generates no cash flow or value through its existence. The rationale behind buying gold usually goes something like ‚Äúit‚Äôs a hedge against inflation/it will retain value once the monetary system collapses.‚Äú Problem is, there are lots of more liquid ways to hedge against inflation, and if the monetary system collapses, you will probably find you wish you bought guns and ammunition instead.  Unless you‚Äôre a jeweler, buying physical gold is an ideological move, not an economic one. People motivated by ideology rarely think about such subtle things as supply and demand and bid/ask spreads.","""You don't sell unless you offer a steep discount""   So true! The people who make money on gold, silver, and other precious metals are the guys who own pawn shops that buy and sell at extreme margins.","Man people here have very little knowledge. OP, here‚Äôs the SIMPLE answer‚Ä¶  Call coin/pawn shops and ask. So many buy at just under spot. Gold is up a lot from just over a year ago so many are selling now and making a ton, from having it for a while.  It‚Äôs true, they‚Äôll buy at just under spot. Many act like you‚Äôll only get 50% or something","It is simple, you never sell it.","Part 1: the prequel  I am in my thirties and was born towards the end of the Lebanese Civil War, which lasted 25 years. Before the war, Lebanon was prosperous, and the Lebanese Lira was recognized in major European exchange offices. However, 25 years of civil conflict changed everything.  After the war, and for the entirety of my consciousness, a man named Rafic Hariri, among others, attempted to establish a system to rebuild the country. Whether he knew it or not, he was setting the stage for what would become one of the greatest thefts in history. The plan was to borrow large sums of money to build infrastructure that would eventually generate revenue, repay the debt, and put Lebanon back on the map. Many countries supported this plan, given Lebanon's cultural advancement and its strong diaspora, so the money started flowing. Hariri had the political power to make this plan legally viable.  However, with the influx of money came corruption and foreign intervention. Hariri's plan favored one sect over another, creating a deep divide in the country. Since Lebanon‚Äôs sects are almost evenly divided, maintaining political support for his plan required ""sharing the cake"" among different groups. But by 2005, one group‚Äîlet‚Äôs call them ""the Axis""‚Äîrealized they no longer needed to share because they had external funding and weapons, giving them the upper hand. Hariri was assassinated.  From an economic perspective, the system initially designed to fund rebuilding projects slowly shifted toward benefiting those in power. Public sector jobs were handed out as favors, rewarding supporters regardless of productivity. Instead of investing in sustainable projects, they funded low-quality infrastructure, paying exorbitant amounts for kickbacks.  Yet, the banking sector appeared strong on the surface. For my whole life i thought we had a strong banking system. I didnt know anything else. To me you always get intehrest and real estate always goes up.. it was a sure thing. Same as you believe bonds are always good. And S&amp;P is safe.. but now I know unless you hold it in your hand. Its not yours.  The central bank, backed by government legislators (everyone was complicit in this ""vicious cycle"" of mutual cover-ups), worked with banks to acquire more debt. They enticed depositors with increasingly high-interest rates to keep the money flowing. Anyone with a basic understanding of economics could see it was a nationwide Ponzi scheme.  Fast forward to 2019: Hezbollah had become dominant in the political scene. The U.S. imposed sanctions on key institutions, and the Ponzi scheme began to unravel, leading to total economic collapse.  Part 2: the collapse   From 2019 to 2021, Lebanon's economic collapse deepened, devastating the banking sector and people's lives. You would think people would ruch to get their money out. But banks were closed. During closure, only bank owners and the complicit political class took their money out. The rest of the people  couldn't do anything. The majority was still politically blindly following their political leader.  The Lebanese pound, once pegged to the U.S. dollar, lost over 90% of its value. Hyperinflation set in, and prices of basic goods soared. Banks froze accounts, imposed strict withdrawal limits, and converted dollar savings at a fraction of their value, wiping out life savings.  There was a civil uprising. People closed all roads and hit the streets for weeks. But the political main actors (refer to prequel where people were handed out public sector jobs.. Well those were a lot) who happened to also have weapons (donations from foreign countries seeking influence) quelled the uprising on one end  On the other end the central bank reserve still had USD stores. To control the upsurge they started subsidising fuel and food... and before you think it was a noble thing to do, it was actually another way to pay pro corrupt government individuals since subsidised goods were sold at full price in neighbouring countries benefitting said axis (refer to Part 1).  The middle class fell into poverty as unemployment soared and salaries became nearly worthless. Businesses shut down, and basic utilities like electricity and water became scarce. Fuel shortages led to long lines and violent confrontations. The healthcare system neared collapse, with shortages of medicine and an exodus of medical staff. The Beirut port explosion in August 2020, which killed over 200 people and devastated large parts of the city, underscored the country's deep-rooted corruption and negligence.  Amid this, many families survived only through remittances from relatives abroad. Those without relatives overseas had to send their young to find work in other countries. For those left behind, life became a daily struggle to afford food, medicine, and fuel. People waited in endless queues for essentials, power outages lasted up to 22 hours a day, and crime rates rose sharply. By the end of 2021, Lebanon was gripped by despair, its society deeply fractured by economic collapse, political paralysis, and corruption.  The country still hasn't recovered. And might never do. A big chunk of productive people have left the country and those remaining are outnumbered by those who got us into this mess. The corruption is so deep rooted its not only in high officials, but within people. People want to vote for ""x mafia boss"" because x has been their provider all their lives. The last elections (after the collapse) ended with results similar to those before the collapse. Unbelievably sad but true.","I'm from lebanon. The economy collapsed. The government defaulted. Banks closed. Money was gone (even money in USD held by banks was gone). Bonds were gone. Trading was suspended. Stocks in lebanese companies and banks gone. Stock market collapse. Write-downs... etc . People committed suicide by burning themselves in the streets.   Guess what didn't get affected because you had it in your hand: gold. And to answer other comments: no, bread and weapons did not become more important. It was not a total societal collapse. Just an economic one.","The whole point of buying gold is to never sell it. You have that peace of mind that when fiat currency collapses, you can shave off pieces of the gold bars into hot water and make yourself some soup.","My retired dad suddenly started talking about buying gold out of the blue, explaining the great need for it once society collapses, which it is about to do.  Doing some digging, apparently Fox News has a LOT of gold selling commercials.","He also couldn't answer my ""Well, if gold is SO valuable why is this company trying to exchange it for about to be useless dollars, wouldn't they be hoarding it all for themselves, for the collapse?""","You give it to the guy walking by with an ox and a wagon with 3 wheels in exchange for a bag of dried beans, a block of hard cheese, a bag of nails, a bolt of heavy fabric, and a single shotgun shell."

By the age of 33 I found that there is nothing more interesting than reading news about economy.  So I did that and then I learned lots of new financial stuff which I had to look up. So I just love to see how world works and grows. Its constantly evolving. I used to read technology news but now I read about all sectors. I like how everything is  connected.   I also proces of biggest sector ETFs now to see which things are moving and how business cycle works. There is so much going on all the time, so many things to check. Its way better than just scrolling.   Be mindful about your actions. Dont just check the numbers, try to question why are things doing what they do.

investing,Sep,1fritrq,Is now the time to invest in AMD?,"How do we feel about AMD at the moment?   AMD 5800x3D processors are in short supply, 5700x3Ds are taking over. Many people switching from NVDA to AMD GPUs because of price to performance.  It feels like at least in the gaming community, AMD is having a bit of a surge.    Obviously NVDA is more than just a gaming company, I've just seen a lot of people joining the AMD side lately.",The consumer side is such a small part of what these companies do now it doesn't really matter. Unless we got a 2016/17 type of market swing where a company comes back from the brink of death it's mostly whatever.,"AMD is an excellent company, but consumer side is an increasingly minor part of both AMD, NVIDIA and Intel for that matter.   However, they are getting freebies from poor management of Intel and price-creep that NVIDIA is placing on consumers, which *will* eventually price out even wealthy consumers.   I can see them taking market shares from Intel on the cpu side if they continue their current performance per watt, and if they can find a way bridge the feature-gap that they currently have with NVIDIA on the GPU side.","Intel even with how bad it has been managed in the last 10-20 years is still ""too big to fail"" in my eyes. And if they ever do come close the US government would probably bail them out anyway.","It's hard to fight the existing CUDA but AMD still stands a chance in the AI segment, if anything you'll have slow steady growth, and that's never a bad thing.",AMD is also more than just a gaming company.  Both Nvidia and AMD make only a fraction of their revenue in the gaming market.  Both are printing money with data center products. The gaming community has only a very small influence on the stock price.,"Intel, maybe. The shareholders, not so much.",I think AMD is a good company. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt bet against them.,would you say Intel is near the brink?,"Yeah, good points. AMD's killing it lately, but you're right - consumer stuff isn't the whole picture. They're definitely benefiting from Intel's missteps and NVIDIA's high prices. If they keep up the efficiency gains and close that feature gap with NVIDIA, they could really shake things up. Long game to watch for sure.","AMD is doing well, it got out ahead of skis a few months back and it's slowly clawing it's way back to the value it surged up to. NVDA has a near monopoly on AI chips but AMD is really the only company even remotely close, which leaves then a role in a huge expanding market. There is rarely just one big winner, so they make sense as a secondary play there, especially when forward PE is lower than NVDA. AMD potentially has a lot more room to grow than Nvidia, which basically needs to maintain complete dominance in AI chips to justify its valuation."
investing,Sep,1fhk46n,is VOO really the best option for a 22 year career plan? ,"This is going to be a long winded post but I feel its important to provide context as to how i've reached this point.  Some background on me, Im a 30 year old male. I own a cheap condo near LA and my only expenses on it are the HOA which is $550 a month and the property tax which is around $500 a month as well. I bought it for $357,000 in 2017 with $200,000 as a down payment (half as an inheritance from my grandmother when she passed and the other half from working sales jobs in college living with my parents). I Paid my mortgage off in 2021 thanks to some crypto currency altcoin investments (Namely shiba inu and dogecoin) so i feel very lucky to be at this point in life already. I am single, no kids, no debt, and I have no plans to get married or even date anyone as I've lost quite a bit of money on past relationships. The only real lavish thing I have in my life that I consider a luxury is my leased honda accord which im paying $320 a month on until Oct 2026 at which time I plan to turn it back in to honda financial since I already have a cheap beater car that I plan to drive after Oct 2026  Job wise, i work a gov't job as an analyst. My pay isn't amazing, but its steady and reliable work, and i do have a pension and they pay my health insurance (As well as a 100k life insurance policy included in my plan). I also have a matching 401k that ive maxed out (IIRC its a Target 2055 or Target 2050 plan). My pension will go into effect in 22 years, at which time i'll have the option to retire on full salary at around age 53, although I may stay until age 55-60 depending on the trajectory of my career.  As of right now, I am left with approximately $2,200 a month in extra money after paying all my expenses, which I have been diverting into VOO the past 12 or so months. My question is, given my background context, is VOO really the best dividend ETF that i can be in? My 401k at work is fairly conservative and there is alot of double exposure between that and VOO. I am thinking of a more aggressive mix, perhaps 60% VOO and 40% something a bit more aggressive. My brokerage is up to around 110k and 90% of it is VOO so i'm looking to change it up a bit and go into different investment areas but not really sure where to begin.  Or, should I just do the popular ""VOO And chill"" method?",A lot of people will say VOO is the way to go. I would add some international. Do not let the past relationships destroy your happiness of dating. Maybe try dating successful women.,VOO and chill  VTI and chill  VT and chill  Pick one and stick with it,"If your summary of past relationships is that they were a ‚Äúloss of money‚Äù, that is pretty wild. Especially considering OP is in a pretty solid financial situation.",Buddy doesn't know loss until divorce. Which I hope never happens.,He‚Äôs 30 he doesn‚Äôt need bonds.,"I found this disturbing, ""I have no plans to get married or even date anyone as I've lost quite a bit of money on past relationships."" I'm not sure dating is so important as long as you are doing social things, and have hobbies.   Moving on. VOO is a good start. If you have convictions or concerns, please state them. For example, if you think the US stock market is a bit pricey, someone might suggest an international stock fund. And when an alternative is suggested, downsides may be discussed.","She was pushing hard for marriage, looking back now that scares the crap out of me because I think that was her plan from the get go. Suffice to say it's scarred me from getting into a new relationship, plus especially these days dating in general just seems to be so shallow and materialistic. The helpless romantic in me hopes one day I find my ""true love"" which sounds corny but it is what it is.","I know it takes some of the fun out of it, but in the long run, the odds are against you beating VOO.

I have a smaller position is SIDUS.  I could throw $5K at Rocket Lab and LUNR, but I'm wondering if folks think this space craze is going to dry up?  I tend to think these 2 have been riding ASTS' coattails a bit lately, but am interested in what others think.","Yes, space companies are going to dry up. We have almost explored all of space.

I‚Äôm not really a fan of pre profit but sometimes exceptions can be made.      RKLB however I have done extensive research on. They are not pre revenue, they have insane growth with around $1.1B in back log. They are close to profitable, once neutron is done and R&amp;D spend is cut then they‚Äôll be profitable. Also note that neutron is coming in cheaper than expected. Electron is on track to have high 40% margins in the next 18ish months. Their space systems is high margins and the largest part of the business (large government contracts). They have a solid plan and proven management that achieves their goals (it‚Äôs space so yeah usually slightly delayed but not by much). They are fully vertically integrated which increased margins and decreases delays and risks. They also have cash on hand to keep running at current loss rate for 2.5 years, tho they should be profitable in 1-1.5 years so even if that doesn‚Äôt happen the loss rate will decrease so they aren‚Äôt really at risk of running out of funds. IMO this is a legitimate investment and not speculation.

investing,Sep,1f84bwo,Why are so many retail investors focused on short term growth at the expense of long term growth? It seems the opposite of what most people are taught in life. ,"Profits need to go up every quarter. Stocks need to go up every quarter. To do otherwise is seen as a failure of company leadership. But, like many things in life, long term investments often pay more than short term profits.   Take a college degree vs getting a job right out of high school. If this was a public stock, people would want to see an income right away even though they know that long-term investment will pay better in the future.   Smart people know this yet everything is focused on immediate growth. Why?",You‚Äôre vastly underestimating the psychology of short vs long term gratification,"Because corporate boards are required to put out financial reports every quarter, corporate leadership is itself obsessed with where the stock price goes every quarter.  Our system incentivizes short-term thinking among both investors and corporate management.","Exactly.   The vast majority of people blow their paycheck as soon as they receive it. They can't save a dollar to their name and impulsively buy crap from Amazon with their credit card.   People tend to listen to their emotional brain first, which development before the rational brain as I understand it. So they just constantly make irrational, emotionally driven decisions, sometimes even having a pattern of the same negative consequences over and over (hard to watch).   Why would investing be any different?","&gt;The vast majority of people blow their paycheck as soon as they receive it. They can't save a dollar to their name and impulsively buy crap from Amazon with their credit card.  I used to work with a guy who seemed to think he figured out how to beat the system.   He would:  1. Get his check. 2. Bring it to the bodega and have them cash it. 3. While the guy is processing it at the bodega, he would deposit the check into his bank account from his phone. 4. Collect the equivalent of two checks. 5. Spend almost all of it at the club on Friday/Saturday nights.  He must have done this like 3-4 times and every time told me I should do it too. He seemed to think there was no way of them finding out that he did it.  Pretty sure he is in prison now on different charges.",&gt;different charges.  So it worked. I'm sold.,"The charitable answer, to go against the grain of this thread, is that time is valuable to humans with finite lifespans and even more finite healthspans. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in one year (even if inflation is 0%). This is something every finance major learns in their first interest theory class.  Wanting a high return on your investment sooner can be rational for many people, especially older people. Yes some of that is due to instant gratification culture, but there's more to the story.","My personal opinion (based on education/work in finance) or at least some of the reasons involves the following factors:  - Most invest emotionally both buying and selling. It tends to lead to buying high on hype and holding and then panicking and selling when down at a loss. Also, people tend to not want to wait, they want to be rich now, not later in life as that is not promised. Plus waiting is no fun of course.   - Speaking of emotionally investing there are many that treat it as gambling instead of investing and it‚Äôs rare anyone is long term successful. They need that dopamine hit. A short term 0tde options contract that may or may not make them a lot overrides the logical part of their brain even if they know. Even if they lose they get that ‚Äújust one more‚Äù feeling and keep going  - Most invest based on what they hear about, not what they actually understand and believe in. I‚Äôm not saying AI is a bad investment (I‚Äôm in it a lot myself), but right now it‚Äôs the hot topic still and the average person just hears AI and sees AI stocks booming and invests. They have no idea about the underlying financials with these companies, what AI is doing for the most part, and the future possible prospects  - There is a lack of proper financial education for many. Especially regarding diversification and using tools like ETFs/Mutual Funds, bonds, etc, instead of just 1 or a few individual stocks   We have obviously pretty much all made stupid trades both based on emotion and logic. But some just never learn from mistakes and take time to learn healthy habits, similar to other things in life like exercise, diet, sleep, etc.","Exactly - it's about the systems we have in place to monitor and report out on corporate performance. Just like with any other reporting / performance review cadence, the people who are accountable for performance will naturally focus on making the next report look as good as possible. This also applies to job performance reviews, project status reports, etc.  Delivering bad news successfully (even if it's just a short-term impact) is hard, and gets exponentially harder as the audience grows. It requires closely managing expectations and ensuring everyone understands the proposed long-term approach; everyone needs to be convinced poor short-term performance is not a problem - especially when there are other companies out there producing short-term gains that could draw away your investors. If you can't convince the audience in the short-term, you get removed from your position and don't get a chance to prove out your long-term strategy.  The tricky part is designing a system that sets everyone up with long-term incentives. You might think shifting from a quarterly reporting cycle to a bi-annual or annual cycle will resolve all the short-term thinking, but then you run into issues where corporations are running without any oversight for long periods of time before having to provide transparency into their performance, leaving investors in the dark.  The [Long-Term Stock Exchange](https://ltse.com/) is tackling this problem.",I think the baby momma charges caught up to him first,"It takes Elon levels of genius to commit fraud with your real name and address attached to it.

Just that. There are some obvious ones such as becoming an accredited investor and go to startups, but what else?",all of the worst ones,"Just based on my limited experience I can say the following but this is all public information and nothing secret like you may want:  1. Better fixed income investment funds require a $1 million minimum initial investment to get into.  Take Schwab for example, they have two tiers of money market funds, the lower tier pays a fraction of a percentage less than the tier which requires the $1 million initial investment. 2. Private equity, this varies by institution from what I have gathered, typically requires a minimum of $250,000 and you must commit to that amount being tied up for as long as 5-10 years.  Again, each PE firm is different so the numbers will vary but that‚Äôs a reasonable ballpark. 3. This may not be what you are asking about but it is an investment nonetheless.  Many franchises require a commitment of &gt; $100,000 and also require you to prove you have a liquid net worth of &gt; $500,000+. 4. This doesn‚Äôt require any net worth but the only way you can get in is if you become an employee.  The Medallion Fund which has spanked all of the very best hedge funds around only allows employees and past employees to invest in the fund.  Wish I could land a job with them lol.  Again, not the best information but I‚Äôm just a poor lowly peon in the investing world so I thought I‚Äôd contribute.

It‚Äôs all math guys,"Sharing an older post about MF   &gt;Hedge fund PM here (both quant and non-quant strategies). I also have read all the Ren Tech books. Long story short, I think they are legit.  &gt;There‚Äôs a couple of things to highlight here. It‚Äôs absolutely possible to beat the market reliably with an algo. However, the skill is that RT has done this across many different asset classes and billions of dollars, which no single strategy can scale up to. And as you scale up most strategies they get arbed away, big guys have liquidity analysis groups which figure out how much you can do before you diminish returns.  &gt;What I think RT does is several things.  &gt;First, the book goes over this but in the past they were doing things like processing data from overnight newspapers to get reports on wheat harvests before most US traders woke up. I think it‚Äôs no set type of strategy but they likely have done everything ‚Äúnormal‚Äù quants do, and they were the first ones doing it before everyone else caught on. There probably is not any special sauce but a revolving portfolio of strategies.  &gt;Second, they (I think) have a central risk allocation system. I think it was in the book, but they likely monitor the performance of all these strategies versus their expected performance, and they dynamically allocate more to winning strategies and cut losing strategies in real time. This handles so much in terms of doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù strategies and avoiding downsides from changing statistical relationships in the market that THIS is probably the secret sauce.  &gt;Now, they have oceans of clean, processed data. I‚Äôd guess they are doing deep learning approaches.  &gt;Lastly, don‚Äôt forget they lost one of the biggest tax cases ever, which is super interesting in itself - they technically owned a long term call option on a portfolio of short term trades to get around short term capital gains tax. They lost the case. But if there was fraud in the fund, I think that case would be probably too close to it where it would come  The rumor on the street is that **nobody** quits MF.

Small cap indexes phase them out as they grow.",Arb Christmas,"There will come an equilibrium point where the marginal investor is equally well served between going passive, and paying someone to invest actively for them. If people keep going passive beyond that, then there will be more and more free lunches available for active investors to exploit, and as they get more obvious the fees which you would need to pay someone to do it would get lower, all tending back towards equilibrium.  The fact that active investors continue to fail as a group to best passive, even before their fees are considered, indicates this is a long way off.  Also bear in mind that price discovery is achieved by volume of trades, not assets under management. 99% of assets held passively while the remaining 1% are traded around at high frequency discovers price just as well as 50/50 with lower frequency.  To the degree AUM have become % more passive, it is massively offset by high frequency algorithmic trading of the remainder.

","Buying physical gold became trendy recently thanks to Costco stocking physical bars and it is blowing up on social media. I read news articles where it's one of Costco's hottest sellers and they can't keep it in stock.  That got me to thinking, whenever you walk by those ""buying gold"" signs, they always play somewhere around 50-70% spot. This isn't anything unlike large collectibles markets such as sports and non sports trading cards and comic books where dealers will pay you some material amount less than 100% of market value so they have some profit margin.  But does that make the physical gold bars a very poor investment purchase? You could try to sell it at near market price, but without any known reputation it's hard to find a market/buyer. It seems that you're already in the hole by at least 25-30%. Even if you were to take it to a known platform to sell on your behalf you're still looking at 15-20% fees.",The only places paying 50-70% spot are those places that buy gold jewelry that is often stolen. Any decent coin shop or pawn shop will pay spot or close to it for gold.,I have a place nearby me which buys gold at spot.,The premium when they sell it.,You always end up paying more than spot when you buy and get less when you sell. That's how they make money.   You don't buy gold for a quick cash. You play options for that.,"They make the profit on the premium they charge.  The coin shop buys a gold Buffalo at spot, let's just say $2500 for this example.   When they sell the coin, they charge the purchaser a premium on each ounce, usually around 5% - 6% of the value (more like 10% - 20% for silver). So, if someone comes in while spot is about the same, they'll sell them the coin for about $2600.  Coins demand a higher premium than bullion, so they'll often pay spot for coins, while paying under spot for rounds or bars.",value only increases if you can find a buyer that is willing to pay for that price.

investing,Sep,1fl4abb,Dad Passed Away- Left Behind a Hefty Sum in Municipal Bonds and a high margin balance- What to do next?,"Dad passed away nearly 2 years ago  and one of the investment accounts he left behind is a Morgan Stanley account with a high six figure balance. I recently called Morgan Stanley to get an idea of the asset mix in the account and he told me that it‚Äôs all in municipal bonds, that is getting around 3% interest tax free. However, there‚Äôs also a margin balance on the account, from when my dad borrowed money from this account a few years ago. The Morgan Stanley account rep was surprisingly helpful in giving me a surface level understanding of what is happening in the account, but I‚Äôd like to get a more detailed understanding of how to address the margin balance. Morgan Stanley said it‚Äôs best we sell off however many municipal bonds shares we need to in order to pay off the margin balance, but that just seems like an easy way for them to get that balance paid off. The martin balance is roughly 40% of the total account balance. How do these margin balances work?  I‚Äôd prefer to just sell off all the municipal bonds and then reinvest all the money in stocks since I‚Äôm way more knowledgeable in that investment pool and have had my own success in stocks over the past 3-4 years. If that margin balance wasn‚Äôt in the picture, I‚Äôd already have sold off all the municipal bonds, but with that margin balance I want to make sure I make the most informed decision. Thanks all!","First off sorry about your loss OP.  Now So let‚Äôs distill it down to the 2 options.  1. Sell off enough bonds to pay off margin balance and keep the remaining in bonds  2. Sell off portfolio, pay off margin balance and allocated remaining in stocks.  Isn‚Äôt that 2 simple choices now? I‚Äôd just go 2 and put it into VOO and chill.  Btw what are the AUM requirements for a MS account?",I feel like your question isn't really about how to invest but rather how to keep all the cash from the municipal bonds without repaying the debt. Good luck with that,"You can't simply not pay off the margin loan. It's inextricably linked to and collateralized by the assets (in this case, the bonds) in the account, and literally as soon as you sell, the margin loan is paid off first before your actual USD cash balance in the account rises above zero.  Perhaps a more useful way to think of it is that the account literally has a negative cash balance. It consists of some number of this and that and the other thing, and the number of US dollars it happens to have is simply negative.  You can't transfer the assets out of the account without paying the margin loan, either. They won't let you, as the account has to stay within the acceptable limits for how much collateral has to be present to secure the margin debt. You might be able to transfer a little out if their policy is to allow that up until the margin maintenance requirement is hit, but after that, your only option is to sell, which automatically pays back the loan.","Your dad‚Äôs strategy was to avoid taxes at all costs. That‚Äôs why he was margined, and buying municipals.  ASSUMING the interest rate he was paying on the margin is higher than the interest rate he was earning on the municipal bonds, the strategy isn‚Äôt rational. It benefits his broker, but hurts him. Selling the margined positions is the way to go.  Talk with your tax guy and estate lawyers to confirm before making a move.","Incredible comment. This dude has ""success"" in a 3 year period of one the biggest bull runs in market history.    Always wonder how it's possible to squander familial wealth and this thread was enlightening",Yeah the fact that he does not realize the simple.answer makes me think all this money will be slowly trickled away in trading single stocks.,"I guess I should add, mom is still alive and she took over the account but has left it up to me to decide what to do with the funds in that account.","Lol, his mother still being alive is probably the most important fact in this matter.","That's an important aspect, that all investments aren't held by you alone, as your mother is still alive.","Did your dad not have a will, and did his money/estate not get settled?  I'm surprised MS is dealing with you on this, without a death certificate.  MS is well within their rights to require the margin account be paid off, and this would normally go through your dad's estate, as would the assets he held at his death.  Unless I'm hugely misunderstanding your post, this just sounds off."

You typically have to accept more instability (risk) to achieve higher (potential) returns.                     The current rate environment for HYSA yields was always going to be an abnormality.  The Fed wants average long term inflation rates to be around 2-2.5% which means HYSAs will be in that same ballpark.            HYSAs and overnight accounts aren't designed to be someone's primary long term investment vehicle.  They exist to provide modest returns with high liquidity.             Anyways, I'll be putting my money in the same places I was putting it before rates fell.  My primary investment is in a target date fund within my 401K.  I have a secondary Roth IRA account that is 100% ETF equity funds.  The rest goes in my checking account.                            As far as your situation, it will come down to a wide range of factors unique to you.","‚ÄòEmergency fund‚Äô is commonly used in reference to money designated for life emergencies.   Investable cash, kept as cash, is usually referred to as a ‚Äòcash position‚Äô or similar language in order to express that it‚Äôs separate from the emergency fund.   Mathematically, cash positions are less effective than being fully invested, when the specific goal is maximizing returns. ‚ÄúTime in the market beats timing the market‚Äù is a popular mantra relating to that. However, some strategies use cash or uncorrelated assets alongside equities in order to rebalance or otherwise store gains or prepare for quick deployment of capital as opportunities arise.   Personally, I‚Äôm fully invested at all times. My taxable account is entirely buy and hold, broad market index funds. My 401(k) is in a target date fund.   My IRA is where I use more active strategy. I hold 40% SSO (2x daily S&amp;P 500 leveraged ETF) at all times, with the other 60% defaulting to VOO. When great swing trade opportunities pop up, or as allocation drift occurs, I move capital from the VOO side.

investing,Sep,1fazud9,Canadian that recently(ish) found out I'm American - are my investments fucked?,"Hey there, so I was born and raised in Canada but during the pandemic I found out I was American. Long story short, my grandfather was born in New York, my father was born in Canada, but because he spent X amount of time in the US before I was born he passed on citizenship to me.   Up until now I've had my money in a TFSA (Tax Free Savings Account) which is after-tax money that isn't taxed at all by the Canadian Government. Apparently the IRS sees it as a foreign trust and does not recognize the tax-free status.   If I transfer it to my RRSP (our version of a 401K) I'll have to pay tax on it when I take it out, even though it was completely funded with after-tax money. So, double tax.  If I sell anything, I pay capital gains tax.   So, am I fucked 6 ways from Sunday here?   Is there any American equivalent to the TFSA where I get contribution room of 5000-6000 per year (that accumulates every year eg when you're 30 you now have 72,000 contribution room if you've never deposited money before)?","IRA / Roth-IRA have a similar annual contribution limit, but I highly recommend you ignore all of us and talk to a financial advisor.

Fairly sure US citizenship isn't automatically granted if you are born elsewhere. You have to actually claim your entitlement.","Depending which financial institution you set up an account with, they should have ample advisors available to you.

He was helpful with filling out the forms but as far as I can remember he didn't say anything particularly profound on the investing front.  I just wanted to check here before spending another $300 / hour to talk with a professional,"You might be entitled to citizenship, but are not yet recognized as a citizen by the US government unless your father did paperwork for the consular report of birth abroad.",This is the answer. By right it is yours and you have to simply declare it to get it or choose to keep forwarding it till you got your business in check.,"If you were born inside Canada, you're Canadian regardless. You at most have dual citizenship but to my knowledge it's not automatic, you have to claim it.","I think this is really bad advice.

investing,Sep,1f72qwe,"What do you think of gold/silver as part of an emergency fund? 
","Most investors don‚Äôt like precious metals as an investment and rightfully so they're not ideal for wealth building, but useful for wealth preservation (a hedge against inflation).  Downsides to gold/silver its not as liquid as cash (this can be viewed as a plus since you'd have to transfer it into cash first - selling to a coin shop). Also you wouldn't stash 3-6 months expenses in cash in your home it would be in a savings account (theft, fire, or other unpredictable pitfalls) so doesn't particularly make sense to stash 3-6 months of expenses in gold/silver for the same reasons you wouldn't stash that much cash outside of a savings account.

Manage my wife‚Äôs inheritance from a deceased relative and the laws around that  4. When are we going to hit the gross adjusted income for Roth contributions and how to navigate that  Idk those are all things that I don‚Äôt know how to do, &amp; they kind of have big tax implications if we screw it up. It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúwealth managers/financial advisors steal from you‚Äù but at what point do you need someone who actually knows this shit to help you with it?","When it takes more than a couple of hours a year to sort through your finances.¬†   I'm talking about the time REQUIRED to figure things out, not the time you spend because it's sort of your hobby.","This sub has an insane hatred for wealth managers. Now, if you find an FA who is just buying a few index funds and charging 1% then no don‚Äôt hire them.   If you find an FA that builds a portfolio that fits your risk tolerance/suitability, can provide answers to the questions you asked AND does a detailed financial plan while also explaining all of these situations to you then that‚Äôs a good FA and might be worth the 1% because they will save that for you in the long run.   Index funds are fine and people just shout buy VOO on here because it‚Äôs been on such a great run, but it‚Äôs been on a great run because the top 7 companies contribute to ~30% of the S&amp;P 500 and maybe that‚Äôs too risky for you.   People always say advisors can‚Äôt beat the market. Well, that‚Äôs not their job to beat the market it‚Äôs to help you retire comfortably.

For many people who are simply doing the dca or boglehead type investing, a dedicated wealth manager is usually not necessary. Even people that don't know about investing can simply use target date funds or a robo instead of a wealth manager.   But for people that multiple types of assets, family obligations, dealing with RMD, estate planning needs, etc. - yes - a wealth manager can incredibly helpful.   As for when to engage a wealth manager - I think it depends on everyone's individual needs.","I had one for awhile, when I was at about $500k net worth.

investing,Sep,1fl2xcw,"If someone fat-fingers a sell order for a stock at much lower than market price, do all stop orders get ""unintentionally"" triggered?","As I understand it, if the stock ABC is at $20 and I place a stop order at $19, then if/when ABC hits a market price of $19, the order is ""triggered"" (not sure what the right term is) and I'll end up selling.  Here's the question: what if I have a stop order at $19 and someone fat-fingers a trade to sell ABC at $1.  Surely the $1 order will be filled.  And so my (and everyone one else's) stop orders would trigger?  Wouldn't this one instance of fat-fingering have the potential to cause a lot of ""unintended"" trades?  Am I misunderstanding how this all works?  But if it is how it works, wouldn't someone be able to do some trolling by buying 1 share each of a whole bunch of stocks and then selling them all for $0.01?  Surely that must have happened by now if that is indeed how it works?","The fat-fingered $1 trade will trade at about $20 - whatever the highest buy order is.   When you sell a share, you mark the least amount you will take for the share. You do not sell it *at* that amount unless that is the highest buy order.  The only way this hypothetical happens is if *all* buy orders between $20 and $19 are fulfilled. In that scenario, your $19 stop order would intentionally and correctly fire.",If it's a huge sell order it will fill all the buys all the way down to the limit until it either fills or runs out of buyers.,"As a practical matter, may brokers will reject orders that are far from the last traded price","the markets will fill orders efficiently. that is, if you sell a stock for 0 dollars itll fill the best non-filled limit order available and if you buy a stock for an infinite amount of dollars itll buy the lowest non-filled limit order available. That is, insta-buy or insta-selling will always give you a decent sale/purchase price. market makers will maintain and adjust order books properly.  its possible after hours, on low volume stocks etc  to get an abnormal trade, but not during market hours on anything with any decent amount of volume.     in order for someone to buy the shares at 100 in your example there'd have to be no other limit sells below 100. and yes, theoretically a 20 dollar stock could off a single share trading hands go to 100 if there was an entirely empty order book. that's often what you see happen around earnings. a stock might have a bunch of orders in around 20, and as earnings come out market makers will rapidly adjust their sales prices and reset/clear/replace buy/sell offers allowing price to fluctuate FAR more rapidly than normal.","How about if somebody intentionally buys with a super high price, lets say $100 in your example.

You can also wait until 10 am instead of 9:30 in order to let the market settle before placing orders. If you're setting market orders in pre-market and getting upset about poor fills then you're the problem, not the market maker.  I would arbitrage your crappy market fill request as well. it's insane to place an order for fill at open plus or minus 5% and then cry about market makers ""manipulating"" the market.

Are there truly no investment with consistent growth? Would appreciate it if anyone can share their experience through economic cycles.",You can‚Äôt manage volatility. There is always volatility. It literally never goes away. You just keep buying.,"Volatility is the price we pay for long-term growth.  If you want steady growth, you'll have to accept low returns.  They probably won't even keep up with inflation.  It's all about supply &amp; demand.  Yes, put money in the right places.  Then, leave it there.  For decades.  Rebalance occasionally.  Buy &amp; hold total-market index-based low-cost stock &amp; bond funds allocated according to your need, ability, &amp; willingness to take risks.","&gt;  Are there truly no investment with consistent growth?   Yes of course there are!  Money market accounts, 90 day Treasuries,  CDs, Whole Life Insurance...  There are any number of high quality assets which aim for constant growth.  The downside is the returns are consistent, but consistently bad.    In investing you get paid to hold someone else's risk.  The return of safe assets is going to be approximately break even after inflatioin.   &gt; but I believe that managing risk on poor assets isn‚Äôt as effective as initially putting money in the right places.  You are absolutely correct.  But you want to get a lot more clear in your mend what is a ""poor asset"" and what a ""right place"" is.   For long term assets you want high average returns even if there is volatility because statistically those higher average returns will win out.  For short term money you likely want higher stability because the higher average return is less impactful.    In general there are 4 goals you can have for investing:  1. Long term accumulation / spending.  This is money you intend to deplete but not for many years. Growth of capital matters the most here.  2. Income (assets you intend to deplete in 5 years or less) 3. Immediate liquidity (assets you intend to deplete on 90 or shorter cycles) 4. Very long term assets (things you intend to pass down across generations 100-300 year cycles of depletion)    Assets that work well for one of these 4 types tend to work quite badly for the others.","I manage it by diversifying. Broad indexes did fine and bounced back quickly in the last correction. I like holding a mix of large, mid, and small cap indexes with bonds.

investing,Sep,1fee1q4,How common are SEC violations for investment firms?,[deleted],It depends on the firm and the violation. Violations do happen.   Some of the ones that you mentioned is a bit of a red flag - you ought to ask the IA about them and see how they respond.   Regarding how common they are - the SEC enforcement actions are public information and statistics are disclosed every year. If you want to look at last year's statistics - you can fine them on the SEC site here - [https://www.sec.gov/files/fy23-enforcement-statistics.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/fy23-enforcement-statistics.pdf)  Delinquent filings against investment advisers which is what you mentioned are some of the more common violations that are enforced.,"i should further point out, that if you're audited by the SEC (or any other govt regulator, CFTC, comptroller of the ccy, FED) you always get a pre-delinquency letter with any violations they found and a chance to remedy them before the audit is closed, without facing penalties (for trivial violations) then you get a clean bill of health.  anything that rises to the level of a fine, is more than a routine clerical error, and it should be taken as a sign of potential lax compliance.","Honestly, SEC violations happen more often than you might think. A lot of them are paperwork slip-ups, like missing deadlines or not updating forms, which sounds like what happened here. So yeah, it could be kind of like a parking ticket‚Äîannoying but not necessarily a huge deal. Especially with the owner dealing with cancer, it seems like the timing was rough. But I'd still check their track record to see if this is a one-off mistake or if they‚Äôve had other compliance issues. Better safe than sorry when it comes to your money!","Good research, it is definitely a red flag.","""that his father used about retaining their services.""  There are a lot of ""old style"" firms that just aren't what you want nowadays. That violation is a good example. I would go elsewhere.  You want something that allows for integrating the info you need with the resources you have, and there is nothing like an amazing UI (computer access and tools and research functions), to make a difference. One reason I stay with the large firm I'm with is their web interface and online tools and phone and brokerage and banker services. Just yesterday we were in a local facility for 2.5 hours to deal with powers of attorney, online access rights, a new account, etc. Yes, it was tedious, but every time we have that level of tasks, it goes pretty well.  Whereas, when I worked with my Mother being widowed Aug 2022, Schwab's Estate department was so hard to work with and made so many errors, that they even sent her a physical ""Sorry we messed up"" gift with an apology card. I had to keep telling the local guy what is provided for inheriting IRA. And they kept having to call someone, because ""We don't keep a licensed broker in this location."" Then we would clarify the phone service fee was being waived, right, because we are *right here in your office* and it's not our fault it's being done by phone by your Employee. Sheesh.","What do they charge in fees? Most likely too much.  Why not open up an account with fidelity or some other brokerage and transfer the funds there. Just buy low expense ratio index funds. Start learning to manage your own money, letting someone do it opens you up to other types of risk.","Your comment isn't quite correct. An IA is not necessarily a broker unless they are dually-registered. Brokercheck is a service from FINRA which regulated brokers, not investment advisers.   Investment advisers are regulated by the SEC and the SEC service to check IA's is called the IAPD. - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)","Those violations are extremely common and mostly amount to not mailing something when they should have.  It wouldn‚Äôt bother me.  I‚Äôd worry more if they were substantial or employed anyone involved in any type of fraud, which is not the case here.    With that said‚Ä¶you should just open a fidelity account, place a single market buy order for all the money, and don‚Äôt sell it for any reason ever unless you have a good reason to that has nothing to do with the market.","I don't think it is terribly common and, it seems to me, that $75K is a pretty stern hit.

investing,Sep,1faluec,"Settled a lawsuit and will pocket about $180k, never had a savings account or invested. Where to start?","I‚Äôm in an ok place financially. I make about $90k/year as a self employed contractor, my husband is in grad school for data science. We‚Äôre hoping he‚Äôll have stable income with 401k options within 2 years.  I‚Äôve never had significant savings, let alone this much money. Seems like every time I get $10-20k saved something inevitably happens. Like the wreck that got me this settlement, I missed 8 months of work and ate through all of those savings. I have never invested before. After paying for some dental work I‚Äôve needed for years and putting some work into my vehicle, what should be my first step with the remainder? People keep telling me ‚Äúhire a financial advisor‚Äù but where do you find a reputable one? What are their typical fees?   I‚Äôm encouraged and interested in renewable energy, AI, and biotech but I admit I don‚Äôt know much about the industries overall. Just have a feeling they‚Äôre going to take off after this next election. I want to be smart about this - my primary goal is to save for retirement, and my absolute dream is to retire early (around 55). I‚Äôm 39 now, it doesn‚Äôt even seem possible.","No one needs a financial advisor if your assets are under $5-10m or so. First pay off high interest debt. Set aside money for an emergency fund (6 month expenses) in a high yield savings account. Then put $7k in a IRA for you and $7k for him at Fidelity, vanguard, or Schwab. Invest it into VTI or VT (VOO is probably fine too)   Then open up a brokerage account at one of those aforementioned firms and put the rest of the money into VTI.   If you don't know anything about finances, don't buy individual stocks or sectors. Just buy the whole market.¬†   You likely won't be able to retire on that alone at 55 without any additional contributions.","If you and your husband are less than financially literate, talk to an advisor about setting up an investment plan.   Basic rule of thumb would be to have an emergency fund of 3-6 months kept in a HYSA.   Other than that, pay off debts and max out a Roth IRA which is around $7,000 per year limit.",This is what I would follow OP,Fees are not trivial but definitely is not the same as when you just have 1k. For example more investment options open up as more allocation strategies.,"Unique tax situations, alts restricted to accredited investors, more complex estate planning. There‚Äôs more but those are the biggies","I honestly don‚Äôt use an advisor myself because I like to manage my own funds. However, the big trusted names around the US are going to be safe in terms of you not being scammed. I‚Äôm not sure of the fee structures and if you‚Äôll like them or not. Maybe others will have more info on which advisors they like and use.   As far as setting up your own accounts, it‚Äôs fairly easy and companies like Vanguard and Fidelity will be able to assist in setting up accounts and how to use their websites/tools.   I won‚Äôt tell you how to invest or what to invest in because everyone has different risk tolerances.

There's not really a strategy that is proven to consistently return greater than 10%,"I initially said that. It's mostly advice I've seen around on the Internet.   When I was 25, I maybe had $50k and wanted to talk to a fee-based financial planner. He said he only considered taking on clients when they had a minimum of $1M. He thought it was unethical to charge anyone with assets under that even though he did a flat rate, fee only financial plan.¬†   Then he told me to pay off debt, use all tax advantage accounts at my disposal,¬† buy target date funds, and call him when I hit $1M. Still haven't got it yet!   For OP, it's more likely they'll encounter an unethical ""financial advisor"" who will put him/her in an inappropriate fund and the ""financial advisor"" will make commissions and not be transparent about that. I have helped family members in that situation and it's not fun untangling that. A family member put every single dollar into 3-6 year annuities with 10% early withdrawal fees that was returning subpar rates -- it was wildly inappropriate on many levels. I'm trying to save OP the headache of finding a good one, when he/she can simply do it themselves.","IRAs have contribution limits of $7k per year per person. You can either put it in pre tax (traditional IRA - meaning you'll be taxed on withdraw) or post tax (a Roth IRA meaning it will grow tax free and you won't pay taxes in the future). I'd try to figure out if the lawsuit proceedings will be considered taxed by the govt -- that would impact my decisions whether it is traditional or Roth.   You should keep contributing to IRAs every year moving forward. Just doing some rough math: if you started with $150k invested, you would need to contribute ~$20k a year for 15 years at 8% growth to get to a $1M by 55. That would allow you to take out $35-$40k a year for spending.¬†   I'd head over to r/bogleheads to learn about investing and r/financialindependence to learn more about retiring early and the math behind it all.¬†   Unfortunately, most financial advisors for people like us (with limited assets) cost too much.

It's owned by a US holding company Futu US which is a public company which trades in the Nasdaq (ticker FUTU).  As a broker - Moomoo is actually just an introducing broker - they use Interactive Brokers and a Futu subsidiary called Futu Clearing.  Brokers like Moomoo tend to operate more like a tech business and use services provided by other brokers - in this case -  Moomoo is just a service that sits on top of Ibkr (""Interactive Brokers"").  The problem isn't really about how the broker deals with sensitive data but more with customer services and support.","Sounds like another fin tech service that adds layers of complexity between you and where your money is going.¬†   Which means points of failure are no longer things that things like SIPC cover, because what is the Fintech firm has an issue where the brokers they work with don't trust them anymore?

When I messaged customer service about my account opening promotions, they're like we already added it into your account coupons or something, which I can't find.   And my next issue with it is they've tried to gamify the whole experience and the app ends up looking and feeling like some chinese gambling app, with all these slot machine spins and mini games n shit, and I don't want this kinda crap in any of my apps, let alone my investment and banking apps.   Next major issue is these guys are gonna pinch you really nicely on the currency conversion (they charge a good 1-2% over the fx rate) so be ready to get fleeced there.

investing,Sep,1fn56ej,Investing in Berkshire Hathaway,I mainly invest in the s&amp;p 500 right now and I wanted to start investing in a stock and I figured BRK is pretty diverse and pretty much its own fund.   Have any of you guys had regrets buying it and do you feel it's still undervalued at this point? Also do you know does this stock have small cap and mid cap or is it mainly large any international?   I'm going to start trying to do more research on this one but any info would be greatly appreciated. I know Warren Buffett and Charlie are something special and I think I would have long-term success with them and their team managing Berkshire,"You can find all the financial info you want on Berkshire.    Few things you need to understand:  1. Berkshire is not 100% invested in publicly-traded companies.  BRK on their own, outright, owns companies you cannot invest in directly.  GEICO, BNSF, etc.    2.  Last I checked BRK holds some $280 B of US treasuries.  This isn't saying ""cash"" like cash in a bank account.  This is US-government debt.  BRK holds more treasuries right now than the Federal Reserve.  That $280 B ""failing"" would be equal to the USA economy ""failing"".  That's a big fucking deal, and not anywhere in the same arena as a single public company - ""too big to fail"" - failing.  No one in the USA really, genuinely wants the US to ""fail"" (ala Argentina) - and neither does any of our allies or enemies.  The destabilization would be monstrous.  3. Only about half of BRK's value is invested in publicly-traded companies.  And only half of that was AAPL (at 48% of their portfolio 6 weeks ago).  So it's not even close to ""overlap"" with the S&amp;P500.  Without looking up the portfolio, it's like Bank of America (sold most now), AMEX, AAPL, KHC, I think there's still some COKE there, and indeed he holds something like $35 M of SPY.  He's weirdly got a bunch of satellite radio operators, and energy in China.    One of my primary reasons to own BRK is to gain exposure to a huge number of wholly-owned subsidiaries that I could never invest in directly.  Did you know they own Nebraska Furniture Mart 100%?  Shit ton of companies like that - big, big businesses that may not ""grow"" the way some people here might want, but they also will gobble up entrants into their core industries.    After Buffett dies, it wouldn't surprise me if we see a bunch of investment in similar industries (I could see someone investing in rail between Dallas - San Antonio - Houston if they had something like a 100-year lease on the rails and they could sub it out).  BRK is so big at this point, it's not just it's own fund, it's it's own mini-economy.","I've owned it and kind of regret selling it. My thought is they are so large now and have so much cash but can't find anything they want to acquire that will ""move the needle"" (since their needle is so large) indicating growth is probably going to be more in line with the broader market. So I sold my position earlier this year with that in mind. I'll note Morningstar says it's overvalued by 7% (but that's probably true for a lot of stocks now).   Their portfolio: [https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/](https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/)","&gt; BRK holds more treasuries right now than the Federal Reserve. That $280 B ""failing"" would be equal to the USA economy ""failing"". That's a big fucking deal, and not anywhere in the same arena as a single public company - ""too big to fail"" - failing. No one in the USA really, genuinely wants the US to ""fail"" (ala Argentina) - and neither does any of our allies or enemies. The destabilization would be monstrous.  I really feel this is very understated whenever conversations about single country (read: USA) risk comes up.  Like, yeah, the points made are valid within a generic context, but: If the US goes down, baby we're taking *everyone* down along with us.","I bought BRKB stock within my Roth IRA 15 years ago and as of today it's up over 700%. I don't feel it's ""undervalued"", but I've never had any regrets having purchased it and I think it's still a solid investment.",Cost ya 30% this year.,"My more meta reasons for owning Berkshire:  * lender of last resort. During times of great financial stress, Berkshire can provide capital when all other valves have closed off. Berkshire made a killing in the 08 crash because no one else had cash. And this includes the US govt, which needed congressional action before being able to step in at large.   * choice buyer. When a company owner wants to sell, they first look to Warren. Partly because Berkshire has the capital to buy anything, partly because Warren can make that decision in an hour without endless planning meetings, and most importantly because Berkshire has kept the promise for sellers to not destroy their business. For this reason, you see many family owned businesses sell to Warren, often at a discount to other buyers. Also many cases of owners who only consider selling to Berkshire.   *  Culture. Over the last 60 years, Warren and Charlie cultivated and hardened a culture of stewardship with antibodies against executive greed. There is almost no overhead for the executive team. Executives don‚Äôt get shares, they have to buy them. Performance bonuses are based on actual over performance, ie gains over the market, rather than all gains. The result is that those at the top do well only if shareholders do well. It also means folks who want easy, high comps start hedge funds and stay away from Berkshire. As an aside, this culture will go through a test once Warren dies. But given how long it‚Äôs had to marinade, I think it will survive.   * Insurance float. Berkshire has effectively free leverage by using the premiums they collect from their insurance operation. This is less useful today than it was 50 years ago  when they were strapped for cash, but it still juices returns by a bit. Float is something that everyone has known about for decades, yet no one can replicate, for various reasons.","Not OP, but I mostly own BRK because it decreases tax liability in taxable brokerage. Indexes with similar outlooks (growth, S&amp;P) pay dividends, which I want to minimize (outside retirement accounts), as they‚Äôre essentially forced taxable sales. I could find a single company that just doesn‚Äôt pay dividends, but BRK is much more diversified.",Timing is problematic in all investment and you gotta ask yourself why and how long. Why are you buying and how long are you planning to hold‚Ä¶ watch some videos and read about them‚Ä¶ I am glad I bought them‚Ä¶ but I was lucky to understand them enough that I got them on a dip per se‚Ä¶ so overall I have them in two taxable accounts and got them after rate hike and some right after inflation announcement‚Ä¶. Overall it has beaten the sp for me‚Ä¶. But I only wanted it to move along or beat the sp500 with less swinging in the price‚Ä¶ and I have added to it‚Ä¶ so if you time horizon is over decades and you add when you think it‚Äôs low‚Ä¶. Or you see Brk doing buybacks‚Ä¶ I have been okay‚Ä¶. And have beaten the sp500 for my holding period‚Ä¶ Warren isn‚Äôt god and he has made many mistakes in his investments but he learned a lot,"While I‚Äôm certain that the days following his death there will be turbulence for the stock, I‚Äôll wager that it actually pops a bit because Buffett, while a genius for his time, is not ‚Äúwith it‚Äù in terms of what comes next.   He had to be convinced to buy AAPL, when it had been clear to many since the iPod, and then the original iPhone, that ‚Äútimes had changed.‚Äù  He doubles down on banks when FinTech is and will disrupt that sector heavily (and has already - but I‚Äôm no crypto-lover).    Other similar examples.   So once someone 40 years younger is at the helm, we may see that $280B deployed in ways that wouldn‚Äôt have been under Buffett. I don‚Äôt think the next leader(s) will be reckless by any means, but I think Buffett sticks to what he knows, and he doesn‚Äôt know a lot about the industries which will pave the way over the next 50 years.   Just imagine space for instance. I don‚Äôt think Buffett would invest in space, but over the next 50 years we are going to see a lot of value created, and those companies will need funding.","I‚Äôm roughly 50/50 between SPY and BRK.B - I like the bit of diversity that BRK adds with not much additional risk. Over the past couple of years that I‚Äôve held it, it‚Äôs doing a bit better than SPY."

investing,Sep,1fbh52t,What to do with Dad's portfolio,"Has anyone here dealt with handling of parents' investments while their health is in decline?  My dad (83) has been in a slow decline physically and mentally since around 2017. In July he ended up in the hospital and has been back and forth between there and a rehab facility since then. Mom got his passwords so I could have a look at his investment accounts. He was always interested and active in the stock market as long as I can remember. What I saw in one of his IRA's was troubling. It showed a drop of over 50% in the last 3+ years.  So I exported all transactions going back to the start of 2020 and tied out the buys and sells.  The good news was that part of the drop was from mandatory IRA distributions. And his stock trades at least had a positive return, though if he'd just bought VOO he would probably have done 5x better. At least he was disciplined with his stop losses.  The bad news was that he lost over $200k gambling with options. He'd been buying calls and puts wallstreetbets style.  He has 40 open stock positions and another dozen active call options that mostly expire in September or October. I had been hesitant to take any action since it's not my account. But I looked at it today and compared it to a week ago and wish I had closed out the options at the start of the week. Rough week for call options. I think on Monday I may close out the options that still have some value. I'll leave the stocks as is, but maybe I should put stop loss orders on the ones that don't have stops? He was pretty consistent about setting stops 20% below the current price and adjusting them.  Anyone here had to deal with this? Any advice? Mom is fine with me doing whatever. Don't think Dad will ever recover enough mentally to get back to trading, but it is a possibility. We changed his passwords and that might be enough to keep him out.",Get clear on the legal situation before you do anything.,"If these are retirement accounts and you don't have a POA, you have no right to do anything.  If the taxable part is a joint account, Mom can designate you.  Get a POA for both of them, stat!",Having a password is not the same as being a legal financial guardian.,"For sure, gotta cover your ass legally first. Learned that the hard way with my aunt's accounts.","You could be my brother. Out fathers are even the same age and mine also lost a lot of money in options as his mental acuity declined over the past few years. (Although my father is a widower.) (I'm now also worried about myself should this happen to me -- declining acuity can be a big threat to future financial security.)  My Father's main account is with Schwab and he had a lot of cash in the default bank fund that pays 0.145%  interest (or something like that). So, make sure any cash is in a Money Market if in Schwab as they don't have a decent ""sweep"" account.  My Fathers has an IRA and Brokerage account.  Because he was trading options and was a frequent trader the brokerage has minimal account balance requirements ($25K). You might need to check for that. I recently had to do an IRA distribution to keep it over $25K (an RMD, though).  If in an IRA, you often need permission to trade options so look at having that removed from the account. That would probably take his agreement unless you get power of attorney, etc.  I have yet to do this.  My father also had an account at Interactive Brokers he had forgotten about. Look out for lost accounts. In this case, leaving it alone from 2019 to 2023 made it the best performing account.  Taxes were a bit of a mess. 50+ pages in the end of year tax docs with all those option transactions in the (taxable) brokerage account.  He was also only doing RMDs from the account he remembered and was under-withholding for fed taxes owed.   My basic approach was find missing accounts and consolidate them (for one, that makes the RMD easier to figure out as well as taxes) then moved his cash into duration appropriate bond funds (max 5 year duration) and money market funds. Stocks were in the Interactive Brokers account which was closed and moved to Schwab and re-invested in bond funds. I left his small gold position and since he also is still interested in call options we put some in JEPI (let the pro's handle the details on options). Others include JPIE, MINT, SCHO, and SCHR.   He also needed a lot of help making sure property taxes are paid on time, taxes are filed, bills paid and he is not defrauded (really, SunRun at Costco exit path, he does not need a leased solar system at age 83), etc. I've had to understand his cash flow to get an idea of how long until he runs out of money and make sure that is kept in mind for investment decisions.","I have been in an analogous situation (except that my father having dementia helped his account go up, because he didn't trade in it.)     Options:     One road is you tell your mom what happened to the account, print statements, show her, explain in simple terms that since his brain went off the boil he started gambling in the account and on its current run the account will go to zero fast. He's going to need the money and so is she - it's not okay.      What needs to happen is someone needs the legal authority to put the account in good order. That means     1. If he still has capacity, you or someone else needs to be appointed the attorney in fact for financial affairs (and for healthcare affairs) and that paperwork then needs to be supplied to his financial institutions so you (or some trustee service, if they want to use a third party) can access the account properly.      The threshold for capacity is low in most jurisdictions. He just needs to understand the nature of the document he is signing, not every aspect of it or the specifics, for that to be okay. If you go down this route you should absolutely consult with a reputable attorney who works in this area to prepare the documents. Do not use a form you got at the public library.     2.  If he does not have capacity. If your father is unable to understand the nature of a legal document, he will be in a situation whereupon he may need to be declared to lack capacity. This is a very difficult situation. The rules will depend on where you live, but it will require the cooperation of your mother and your father's doctors. Then you'll have to engage in a somewhat formal process, the result of which is that someone else will be appointed to act on his behalf. If he is still some what with it, this will probably upset him. Doctors don't like to do this. And the Threshold for how ill your father needs to be to do this is high.     Regrettably, the law actually is not very good at protecting vulnerable people in these situations. People who are only partially compromised, but have not made voluntary arrangements to protect themselves when they were well, slip through the cracks of the system. Without knowing specifics, I don't know where your father is.     3. I couldn't tell you that just fudging it by knowing all his passwords and changing them and so on is the right option, but it is what a lot of people do in reality. It's what a lot of doctors and healthcare professionals secretly advise people do to their infirmed elderly relatives because there are not good systemic protections for them. But this approach is not really all that legally sound, and it has limitations - a lot of things require signatures. You will eventually reach an impasse.      Other key advise:     If he still is, it's probably time to stop driving   You need to work out what estate planning your father has done, if any. Does he have medical powers of attorney? Has he written a will? These things need to happen if they can still happen. An estate lawyer should be sent anything he has to review if they are validly executed.     If you're not, go to the medical appointments with your dad and ask them privately how serious and debilitating his medical situation is, and if it's recoverable.     Seek out mental health resources. This will become a taxing situation for you if it isn't already.     Make sure your father has files taxes appropriately for prior years and make sure you recover things like unreimbursed medical costs.      I have a lot of experience with these situations, you can message me if you need to.",You shouldn't even be accessing the accounts until you have a poa....,Probably too late to get the POA if dad is already showing signs of dementia.,"NAL, but with a retirement account no one else is legally allowed to trade. I'm not saying people don't do it, but you can't have a co-owner on an IRA.","If you don't think your Dad is likely to take back control of his trading, I would look toward stabilizing his account and more to a much more conservative portfolio."

Some companies even use stock as collateral for loans, [and are required to compensate the lender should the stock fall under a certain value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp).","I think your question itself is flawed.  In a sense, the stock market doesn't really exist for the sake of the company.  Stock markets exist for the Owners of companies.  They are primarily there so that the owners of companies (AKA shareholders) can buy or sell their stake of ownership.  And at a fundamental level, companies don't even exist for their own sake.  Companies are created to make money for their owners.  I'm guessing you have the wrong paradigm regarding markets and companies.  It's the shareholders (owners) of the company that control what the company does.  When a company goes public via IPO, it generally adds additional owners.  This is when the company generates shares out of nothing and sells them to new owners.  Existing owners have their % ownership of the company decrease. Those existing owners are generally comfortable owning a metaphorically smaller piece of a larger pie.  And this is only occurring theoretically because the company sees an opportunity to make even more money in the future. (And a company only goes public if the existing owners want it to.)  In the post-IPO future, if one owner sells some ownership to another-you are correct that this has no direct benefit or drawback to the company.  But owners fundamentally have a benefit-certain decisions (Like who management is) are controlled by shareholders, as people vote with their shares.  Generally, shareholders will eventually vote to give themselves some portion of the company's money...though how that occurs can be simple (dividends) or complex (buybacks).  Though it's a lot more complicated when you start looking at exactly how these decisions get made...","Typically, the public company holds a large percentage of the total shares outstanding. This incentivizes them to increase the value of the company (increase the stock price) because as the stock appreciates in value, the company itself becomes more valuable.   The company doesn‚Äôt care if either Jack or Jill owns the stock. They just want the price to increase.","Employee compensation. And company can issue more shares to raise $. Tesla did this at its bubble peak, raising billions when they were almost bankrupt.",Doesn‚Äôt have to just be management. RSUs and stock options are granted to ordinary employees at many companies.,"Owning shares of stock mean you own part of the company. Generally speaking when the company does well, the stock goes up. While the price of the stock has some benefits to the company (for example if they use it to buy another company), it also greatly benefits the employees of the company that also own its stock (usually upper management and those with stock options). But to a large degree a higher stock price doesn‚Äôt benefit the company much . Bad company performance and bad stock prices sometimes mean managers and possibly even the CEO will be replaced.","You finance some capital for a big expansion with a convertible bond at $20/ share senior debt with 3 year maturity.    Stock goes to $5 three years later.   someone else now owns your company, previous owners (stockholders) are wiped out.   executive pay is heavily stock based so they're wiped out.  employees get paid 20% of their comp through stock so they just got a pay cut.   convertible bond holder isn't in the business of running companies.  it's a lose-lose-lose-lose for everyone",That often trickles down into cost cutting at the employee level (layoffs) if the shareholders aren't happy.

I've been watching a lot of financial youtube content about how tons of people mismanage money, spend frivolously, and set themselves up poorly for retirement. So if we could snap our fingers and all those people suddenly got their shit together, how would it impact the markets and the economy? Like Coke stocks would probably rise based on valuation, but Coke sales would at the same time probably plummet. Overall, would things be better or worse in the markets and in the economy as a whole?     I know it's a silly hypothetical and it would never happen. Still, feel free to indulge.",The market would go up.¬† This is what happened when they invented 401k.,"When you buy someone has to sell. The money doesn't disappear.   So say every Joe buys standard vanilla Coke &amp; S&amp;P500 stock.   * Those previous holders sell their vanilla stocks for a price where they don't see further value in holding.   * They obviously don't re-invest those proceeds back into the same jacked up stock. Instead they look to other areas that might still have value. Perhaps small caps.   * Those small cap holders sell at a premium and look further out the risk curve to speculative ARKK, Biotech, Space, etc type stuff.   * Those ARKK holders look further out to Bitcoin, etc.   * Bitcoiners speculate into shitcoins.   * Shitcoiners cash in and buy coke and lambos.   So at some point you still get your consumption.   Btw, this is essentially what QE attempts to do artificially. When Joe isn't buying the government buys shitloads of boring stuff (treasuries). That pushes those safe asset holders to go buy something further out like stocks, etc, and eventually consume.   The **real** problem happens if the country is deeply indebted, like post bubble Japan or China today.   In this case people take the money and pay off debt. That is essentially dead money and the economy contracts. This is called a balance sheet recession.","If everyone who could invest did so, it could lead to increased demand for investments, potentially driving up prices.This could create a bubble in certain markets and increase market volatility.","But they would be spending less on the products that the companies they invested in sell (collectively) and it would in effect ""lower revenue"" and profits.","Would probably eventually also lead to the mother of all corrections, making people who are scared of the market cash out at inopportune times and never invest their money in the market again",It may also drive innovation.

People who use too much of their income to buy goods that have 0 return on value, and people who basically hoard their money and put it into investments.  Advertising preys on the consumer class, and I wonder how many crappy business with bad product and prevalent marketing would fail. But this would require society as a whole to be more self-aware and impulse controlling, which isn't going to happen for another million years of evolution or so...","P/E ratios would rise. The flow of investment into the stock market is why stocks are more expensive now, relative to earnings, than in the past.","People who do not understand the market, should stay out of the market.  All this would lead to is higher viotility as new investors would be jumping in and out of stocks based on how the wind blows.",The closest simulation would be in 2020-2022 pandemic time when everybody's got nothing to do during the lockdown and decided to invest. Price went up. Then there was QE money to amplified the effect.  Many assets will not see that level of price again ever...
investing,Sep,1fpgk7x,Does anyone know the name of the logical fallacy that makes people hold an investment that they wouldn't make again today?,"There is a tendency for people to hold employer stock they are gifted, which wouldn't be subject to any tax if they sell it immediately, even though they wouldn't buy that amount of employer stock if given the value in cash.

I thought it was something else but I can't find it anywhere. Thanks for any insight!",I think you're referring to the [Endowment Effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment-effect.asp)  &gt; The endowment effect describes a circumstance in which an individual places a higher value on an object that they already own than the value they would place on that same object if they did not own it.,Sunk cost  FOMO,"Yes, lots are saying sunk cost, but that specifically refers to something that is down in value that should be sold. Whereas the Endowment Effect is something you currently own.",Good total list of investing fallacies here: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Behavioral_pitfalls,"It‚Äôs definitely related to Sunk Cost but not the exact same thing.   Sunk Cost fallacy: you‚Äôve put money/effort into X, so you are less willing to give up on it even if it wouldn‚Äôt make sense looking at it purely from your current perspective.   Easy example is fixing a car. Let‚Äôs say you are fixing a car up, you‚Äôve spent $5000 and countless weekends working on it. Suddenly you discover a new problem, a new problem that is very severe meaning the car is essentially totaled. It‚Äôs gonna need way more effort and money to fix than you originally thought. But you decide to keep going anyways because you‚Äôve put so much time and money in, you don‚Äôt want to feel like you wasted that time and money even if the logical choice with the current knowledge is give up.    There are psychological studies that line up more with what you are describing. Things like the exposure effect where people like things the more they are around them. This includes people preferring to own stocks in companies they know (like the one they work for) compared to others regardless of fundamentals.    There is also a related ‚ÄúEndowment Effect‚Äù where people place higher values on things they own then they would on the same thing if they didn‚Äôt own it. Take 100 people give 50 of them a new toy to own and then ask them how much they like it or how valuable it is vs just showing it to the other 50 and not telling them they own it. The 50 who own it will on average rate it higher.",Wish I had read that years/decades ago,"The sunk cost fallacy is the tendency for people to continue an endeavor or course of action even when abandoning it would be more beneficial, simply because they have already invested resources (time, money, effort) into it.","Are you thinking of RSUs?

investing,Sep,1frjpuv,Should I Stop Contributing to 401k and Start Contributing to Roth?,"I'm using my real numbers here.       My salary is $248,722.79.  I get a 10% bonus every year (taxed and on the books), effectively making my income $273,595.10  This salary puts me in the 24% Federal Tax Bracket and the 6.85% NYS Tax Bracket.  I get a 5% raise each year on total compensation.  So in 2030 I'll be in the same NYS Tax Bracket, but the 32% Federal Bracket.  That's a huge jump.  Realistically, I probably have another 30-35 years working.  I'll be able to retire sooner but love flying, and will continue to do it for as long as I'm able.     Right now I'm contributing 8% to my 401k with a 6% match.  So each every two weeks I'm contributing $765.30 and my employer is contributing $573.98.     There's a note on my contributions-adjustment page that reads ""Your employer matches up to 6% of your eligible compensation that you elect as Pre-tax, After-tax or Roth contributions"".  Should I change my contributions to Roth, based on the near-guarantee that I'll be in a higher tax bracket in the near future?  Should I split between the two?

Second, it's not a huge jump because you're only paying 32% on the portion of your income that exceeds the 24% bracket, not every dollar.

I'm more concerned about chip stocks, September got off to a rough start for chip stocks, with $NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$ tumbling nearly 10%, the $PHLX Semiconductor Index (.SOX.US)$ slumping 8%, and shares of $Micron Technology (MU.US)$ and $Intel (INTC.US)$ declining by more than 5%, etc. But I didn't have a DCA investment plan before, investing in ETFs containing shares of these stocks looks safer...ETF recommendation? And more importantly, would you like to talk about the optimal frequency and strategy for DCA investing?",DCA is only good if you understand fundamentals,"&gt;The purpose of the DCA strategy is to remove timing considerations altogether.  The irony is, however, it really (on average) *introduces* a market-timing element rather than removing them entirely. As frequently discussed in this sub, [lump sum beats DCA historically by a comfortable margin](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/lump-sum-investing-versus-cost-averaging-which-is-better). Meaning, if you *truly* acknowledge you cannot time the market and know nothing about its short term future movements, the default position ought to be lump sum (the on-average clear winner). Choosing DCA instead is (whether consciously or unconsciously) to make a bet that you think the market will drop at some point in the next 6/12 months (or whatever your DCA period).",It's *always* a good time to DCA.,"You're overthinking it. Buy VOO or VTI and call it day.

Besides 0% commission and auto-invest?,"DCA vs lump sum is mostly about risk tolerance.  Also DCA is an overloaded term which I find causes some confusion - you can DCA by spreading out a lump sum, or DCA into the market as you get funds from your paychecks.","Do  you mean DCA as in holding a big cash position and slowly entering positions?  Or as in making money and periodically adding to your positions?  The former usually comes out worse, but if it helps  you sleep at night, whatever -- usually it's not hugely worse, and sometimes it ends up better.  The latter isn't really a choice since you can't invest money you don't have.","If you open a US account with moomoo and trade options, they don‚Äôt charge anything per contract, it costs $0, which is a pretty sweet deal.","DCA is just buying every month when you have funds, you should be doing that already.","Low contract fee. if you need to do it frequently then high contract fee would ruin your experience, and the platform should offer the flexibility to set custom order expiration dates and conditions."

Honestly, at your age, I'd put 3k into an IRA, 3k into an emergency fund, and then use the other as needed (hard to say for the full amount since i dont know the regularity of other income).

He is strongly pushing her to invest all her money in American Funds Growth Fund (AGTHX). I told her she is better off putting her money in SPY and QQQ as there are no fees but the advisor told her that 'over the longer run American Funds outperforms the SP500 index' - She believes him. Can anyone share their experience with financial advisors who push American Funds? Any advice on how I can get her to understand why she is better off investing in SPY and QQQ? Thanks!,"This is something that should be incredibly easy for any adult to determine themselves. I would recommend VOO over SPY as its expense ratios is slightly lower while holding similar assets. All this data is from the website for each respective fund.   Expense ratios (maintenance cost of using the fund):  VOO - .03% AGTHX- .63%  Returns:  VOO: 1 yr = 27.10% / 5 yr = 15.87% / 10 yr = 12.94% AGTHX: 1 yr = 22.59% / 5 yr = 14.29% / 10 yr = 12.24%  From this its clear to see that the growth expectations are decently similar between the two, with VOO having a slight edge. VOO has a much lower expense ratio though. Assuming $2.5 million dollars, VOO would cost $750 per year and AGTHX would cost $15,750 per year.   Its clear that VOO is the winner.

While money market/HYSA interest rates have been in the 4-5% range for the past couple of years, they were much lower for a long period of time.  And, they‚Äôll probably start to fall in the near future.  And, if you take out funds from the account, you miss out on opportunities to see it grow.  Learn to live below your means.  Build up separate emergency fund in a HYSA.  If you‚Äôve maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, start a taxable brokerage account that you might use to fund some of your wants.","While you're right in the ideal case, many people can't afford to both build emergency savings and max out their Roth. In circumstances where a choice has to be made, it makes complete sense to put the money in a Roth knowing you can access it during an emergency.","I can't think of a single side effect of a Roth IRA that is negative. Literally the only compromise is when you make too much money you can't contribute to it anymore, but there's a back door for that.   Eventually after you have contributed for many years, you can start pulling from the account early because you can just pull out what you put in before touching the earnings.",Keep your emergency fund in a HYSA.  Don‚Äôt use your retirement accounts as savings accounts.,It depends. A contribution can be withdrawn with no tax or penalty but any gains cannot be. So 7k in you can pull 7k out. Rollover contributions become seasoned after 5 years. So you could roll a chunk of a traditional ira into a Roth when you‚Äôre at a lower than normal tax rate for whatever reason and then withdraw that 5 years later tax free. People do it to retire early.,"&gt;I like the idea of having a tax free fund to pull from when I retire   For me this is key to successful retirement planning.  It isn't just about income tax planning.  Being able to control how much taxable income you have in retirement affects things like how much ACA costs (if you want to retire early), Medicare costs, taxability of SS benefits etc.  Probably more I'm not thinking about.  Although you should absolutely take full advantage of the employer benefit, I would still do what is necessary to get money into Roth every year, even if it's not the max.  It's saving my butt right now at 60."
investing,Sep,1fnn5wu,How do you track your rate of return between all your accounts? ,"I've recently been curious about my rate of return over the past 5 years that we've been taking investing seriously. Between my spouse and I, we have 6 investment accounts between old and current 401ks, Roth iras, and brokerage accounts between different brokerage companies.  When I log into those accounts I can see the rate of return they give for that specific account, but I want to know what the rate of return is for all of our accounts combined.  My solution so far has been to track the year end balance of all accounts in a spreadsheet. And do a weighted return calculation from like the 2023 end balance compared to the 2022 end balance. Taking into account our total contributions to get the total weighted rate of return.  Is this an accurate way to calculate rate of return or is there a better way? Are there any online tools you use to track this between all your accounts?",Use google sheet buddy,"I haven‚Äôt, I‚Äôm doing the ‚Äúand chill‚Äù part.  Seriously though I don‚Äôt one account is higher risk and the other conservative.  And my job changes providers so even if the 401k site made the information easy to find, I couldn‚Äôt do 5 years without some work.    Over the longer term it‚Äôs about 12-14%, and the last year is an intimidating 28%. Both numbers really lean on the current ATH.","I use Google Sheet. You can use googlefinance() function to pull data for ticker and works for stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, etc. Yes you have to manually input holdings and cost basis, but it's not so bad. With everything in, only takes a few minutes twice a month to update holdings and cost basis. Every month I take a snapshot and log to a table in the Google Sheets and I've been doing this for 10 years now so have a lot of history and can use that data to chart things out, compare against SP500, FTSE, etc. I also have allocation targets for retirement and non-retirement and can tell how close I am to allocation targets and whether I need to rebalance or at least where new funds should go and change allocation targets as I get closer to retirement.",Most accurate would be using XIRR with values every time you contribute. This will give you a money weighted return. You could compare this to the MWR using a benchmark index (just be sure it‚Äôs a total return index) assuming you‚Äôd invested in that in each contribution date.   Or do this annually as you do now. Less granular but it‚Äôs something.,[deleted],[deleted],"The only thing that matters to me is the total balance of my retirement portfolio (taxable brokerage + 401k + IRAs + RSU equity + crypto).  I have a spreadsheet that keeps track to this.  Every December 31 I record the total balance of my entire retirement portfolio.  Yes, I continue to contribute to my 401k and may take small withdrawals from my brokerage, but the overall balance is where the rubber meets the road.  This is the only number that matters and it should be going up.","There no way to pull data directly from your brokerage though is there?  I have a massive Google sheet that's clunky af, with everything inputted manually.  But it sure would be great if I could pull it all from my actual brokerage.  Yahoo finance can, but there's not a lot of options there to do anything with it.","If you load in any kind of sizeable assets, be ready for a phone call marketing their sub-standard robo advisor service.","I use testfol.io to approximate it. I just plug in the starting amount, average monthly contribution and average asset allocation. Tweak the numbers until it shows the same dollar end value that I actually have.  It isn't too important to get an exact rate of return though."
investing,Sep,1ffshfy,Emerging Markets or Just India?,"As a 24-year-old investor with a long-term horizon, I'm trying to build a growth-oriented portfolio. Right now, I‚Äôm considering allocating 85-90% in VOO and 10-15% in emerging markets for international exposure. However, given India's rising prominence as a rapidly growing economy, I‚Äôm wondering if it might be better to shift my international allocation to Indian stocks instead of broader EM exposure.  India is projected to be one of the fastest-growing economies over the next few decades, driven by its young population, technological advancements, and economic reforms. Considering that, would a portfolio of 85-90% in VOO and 10-15% in Indian stocks potentially outperform the more traditional VOO and EM allocation? Should I focus on India‚Äôs long-term potential for stronger growth instead of diversifying across all emerging markets?","FYI India's growth is priced in, it has the highest CAPE in the world even higher than the US one. Anything short of perfection would be a bad thing for Indian stocks. Indian ETF also tend to be expensive.",India has been projected to grow faster my whole adult life.

Are you sure you're not just past performance chasing because it's done well recently?,"How much do you really know about India vs. the other emerging markets?  India is projected to have the highest growth in GDP, that much is true. However, that doesn't necessarily translate to appreciation of equity.   Furthermore, it's not news that India is expected to be the frontrunner in EM, particularly with the recent chinese weakness - but as a result of that some money has already flocked into India and I believe valuations in India are rather high compared to valuations in other emerging markets.  That said, I still expect India to do rather well. It's just that I cannot possibly know if it's actually gonna be the frontrunner or if we suddenly see countries like Brazil or Indonesia explode to the upside.  Then again, it's all about what you know and how comfortable you are with omitting parts of the market. For example, I'll happily omit developed Europe, apart from MAYBE countries like Denmark, because I have some confidence that those countries are not gonna outperform.  And if you have the same level of confidence about India, ideally have the knowledge to back it up, it's reasonable to take that bet.   It certainly holds the potential for outperformance, but just be aware that you're taking on more risk and less diversification by going India alone over EM.","I've had a \~20% allocation (and growing) to $INDA, and it's done really well for me, for the last few years.  I'm boosting my allocation MoM while closely watching for political instability that may create one-off bulk buying opportunities.

Then based off your tax situation, start converting and withdrawing from the IRA to a Roth IRA to deplete/convert by age 73 to avoid having to take large RMD‚Äôs. There are no RMD‚Äôs on a Roth IRA, you just need to make sure you don‚Äôt break the conversion rules ( any money converted to a Roth must sit for 5 years ).","Just to nitpick terminology since the subject is so confusing to many people, moving the pretax 401(k) to a traditional IRA is a **rollover**, not a conversion.  And moving from the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is a **conversion**, not a withdrawal.","&gt; its best to draw from 401k as its a taxable account  401k accounts are tax sheltered in some form.  It's not a taxable account.  &gt; you should let your roth grow as much as possible  You should let all your accounts grow as much as possible.    &gt; per say  per se  ---   Roth and Traditional are *contribution types*, not *account types*.  You can have Roth or Traditional money in an IRA or a 401k.    When you retire, you may want to roll over your 401k into IRA accounts -- Traditional to Traditional, Roth to Roth.  So the account type doesn't matter as much as how the money is characterized, as Roth, or Traditional, or money that isn't tax sheltered like in a taxable brokerage.  Generally the more income you show in a year, the higher your marginal tax rate gets.  In order to keep your tax rate low, it probably makes sense to take out Traditional funds up to a certain income level, then take any additional out of Roth which won't show up as income.    Exactly what level that is will depend on tax law, medicare subsidies, your expected income in retirement, your social security checks, what portion of them will show up as income, what proportion of money you have in Traditional vs Roth, etc.  So there's no easy, one-size-fits-all answer even for current rules -- by the time  you retire, the rules will be different.  So I wouldn't sweat it too much -- just aim to enter retirement with money in all 3 buckets  * Traditional (subject to income tax when you take money out in retirement) * Roth (subject to income tax when you put money in while working) * Taxable brokerage (subject to capital gains taxes whenever gains are realized)  Then you'll have the flexibility to do what makes the most sense. Odds  are good you'll want the majority of your money in the Traditional bucket, since you have more flexibility with what sort of income you show in retirement.  But there's always corner cases.","Whether you touch your Roth balance or not depends on how much you're withdrawing. Ideally you fill in the lower brackets with pre-tax withdrawals and the higher brackets with Roth. Doesn't make sense to pay higher taxes so you don't have to touch your Roth balance, in the end you end up paying more taxes.  If you can live off of dividends only then there's no need to sell. There's nothing magical about dividends versus selling, dividends is just automatic.",Contributions aren't related to distributions or conversions.

In a podcast I listen to, they often recommend SPYI and praise the dividend income they receive.   The way I see it, if that money was just invested in something like VOO they would be up much more for the year. And if you are taking your dividends out and spending them, would you ever expect the fund to really grow in value due to you not reinvesting?","You‚Äôve come to the right sub, we mostly advise against dividend focus",Many investors invest in growth stocks/funds like VOO as long term investments - money that won't be touched for many years.  I am one of these.  Having an income aspect to your portfolio increases your cash flow - money you can spend now.  I actually reinvest my dividends so I can boost my dividends further and/or buy more shares of growth stocks/funds as opportunities come along.  The passive income can also act as a safety net in the event you need a monthly boost to your bank account for whatever reason.  The downside of a fund like SPYI is also smaller than the actual index; the index might lose 5-10% etc. in a downturn but SPYI will usually only decrease in value by a fraction of that.  It's purpose is to provide a steady &amp; high income stream.,"It's for people who want income.  If you aren't retired it doesn't make much sense, IMO.  As a retiree though, you'd still want to assess the rate at which those dividends will be taxed compared to just periodically selling and taking a capital gain so it's still not black and white.","If someone thinks that the mega-cap tech stocks that dominate the S&amp;P 500 are overvalued, he/she might prefer to invest in parts of the market that they believe are less overvalued, whether it is dividend stocks, small-cap stocks, value stocks, international stocks, etc.","You don't a dollar is a dollar and total return is what counts.  The vast majority of people don't understand dividends they see it as something like interest paid on a bank account, when really its more like moving $1 from your savings into your checking .

It's really the amount invested that counts not some arbitrary number of shares.  Now that is not to say avoid dividends or value and just go into growth , its just don't focus on dividends because of dividends .

I was really bummed when SOFI dropped TGIF","Dividends aren't magic.  Seeking dividends for the sake of dividends is generally a mistake.   Dividends as an side effect of some investment strategy might be fine.  Like if you feel like you want lower volatility and you reapportion your portfolio to reduce volatility by going overweight in the value side of the market, or lower volatility sectors of the market, your dividend yield will likely go up.  That's fine, not even a negative if it's in tax-sheltered accounts or if your drawdown is more than the dividends you earn.  And unless you're throwing around a LOT of money, the tax drag would be pretty small anyway.  Back in the bad old days when there were trade fees and you really wanted to trade in lots of 100 shares, dividends were a good way of getting money out without worrying about those things.  Those advantages are largely gone now.  But dividend investing still seems very popular.  I think it gives those investors a (mostly false) sense of security, like they aren't selling and therefore they can't run out of money or some crap."

It is a riskier game, putting in a (one time lump sum).   ‚Äî&gt;Now, since you are (investing a LARGER SUM of money = money is to large = $50k), how would you ‚ÄúDCA this, or invest this‚Äù?           This is a good question.       You can either: (1)minorly DCA/(2)moderately DCA/(3)aggressively DCA.   PS: (New presidents being in office, can play a role in stock market performance) + (domestic politics, can play a role in stock market performance) + (Global politics, can play a role in stock market performance).   If I were to have $50k, and I were to allocate $50k, to investing.       I would just DCA it, over a period of 3 years.","I would set a strict DCA plan of $1,000/week over the next year, but consider accelerating the last half around March or so based on market conditions. Lump sum beats DCA 2/3 of the time, and people pretend the remaining 3rd doesn't exist. With $50k coming to me a month before a US election, I'd be a lot more comfortable DCA'ing for now personally.   You can always lump sum the remainder any time you feel like it, but you cannot go back in time and switch a lump sum to a DCA. Start with $1,000/week and get a feel for the vibe. You don't have a gun to your head to etch the decision in stone right here right now.","If you're feeling confident about VOO, investing all at once could give you a nice boost, but dollar-cost averaging over 50 months can help reduce risk by spreading out your entry points",If you need the money in 10+ years it won't really matter with a lump sum investment.,"Right but that situation is one of the best ones for DCA. Push it back 18 months, where you start on 23/03/2020 (the bottom of the COVID crash) and lump sum gets you $92,755 in three years ($137,075 today) but DCA in weekly over three years gets you only $52,368. That's 44% less, even worse than your 2008 example.  It works both ways, yes the market can crash but the market can grow a hell of a lot over three years as well and if you didn't put it in when it goes up, you also lose money.  And it goes up more than it goes down... like I said the Vanguard research on this is 2/3rd of the time, you are better off putting it all in as a lump sum.  Also the longer you leave it, the more gains you give up. The Vanguard study involved averaging in over 12 months, and you're suggesting three years. That's even worse.  It's ultimately risk/psychology, if he has to do a bit of DCA I'd think, put at least 50% in lump sum and DCA the rest in over the next 12 months, not the next three years, you are almost guaranteed to lose money doing that. The only question is whether you lose a little or a lot."

investing,Sep,1fqejh1,I'm thinking of putting 100% of my Roth IRA in FDKLX.,Hi! I'm currently maxing out my Roth IRA with FXAIX but I'm thinking of changing it up next year to FDKLX. Is this a smart move (I'm 26 turning 27 in February)? I plan on just investing around 600$ a month until retirement. I like the flexibility of a target date fund for this account due to the fact that it automatically makes my investments more conservative as I age. Do you think this is a good plan?,It's a totally fine strategy to use if you want to be hands off as far as allocation. They are probably a little conservative for me personally. But You can always go more aggressive by choosing a later retirement date fund.,So you wanna just die with a fully loaded roth,"No, compare the performance charts of FDKLX vs the S&amp;P 500 (FXAIX) and Nasdaq. It sucks. You would probably be missing out on hundreds of thousands of dollars.","It's not great at your age.  You would probably see higher returns investing in a S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index fund and will likely lose less of it to expenses (FDKLX has 8x the expense ration of FXAIX).  You can always revisit the decision in 10-15 years when having more conservative assets in your portfolio will be more relevant.  You might want to look at the graph [here](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315793695)  of FDKLX vs S&amp;P 500.   That being said, it's not a terrible plan; it just probably will have lower returns than other options. If you did decide you wanted to have a diversified portfolio you can get away with just spending 10 mins a year rebalancing to your desired ratios in index funds and save on the increased expense ratios target retirement funds often have.  Keep in mind how a ROTH is taxed.  It is usually a good idea to have your growth stocks there and have more conservative options in a different type of fund if you have that option.  You are early in your career so you may one day have other funds.  Oh, and one more point, you would go slightly over the 2024 contribution limit ($7000) at $600/month ($7200) so keep that in mind.","If you prefer a more hands-off approach with automatic adjustments, FDKLX is a solid choice.","I keep my Roth IRA as aggressive as possible. It is the last account I will spend down, so I really see no need for anything but stocks in it until after I retire. Hopefully I‚Äôll be living off my brokerage, 401k and social security and never have to touch the Roth.",Expense ratio 0.12% is not the worst. IMO OP is way too young to be conservative about investments. I don‚Äôt understand the mentality of paying more for less returns than a low cost index fund. Why do so many people think paying ER every year for a target date fund is a good idea?

investing,Sep,1fpxi5n,50 years old with no investing experience: Seeking guidance after house sale and relocating,"I've never really been interested in investing, but lately things have started to change. About 10 years ago, my wife wanted to invest some money, so she contacted the firm Putnam. I didn‚Äôt pay much attention since then, but recently I realized that the initial $8,000 investment has grown to $52,000. The fund that has been used is the Putnam Sustainable Leaders A.  Soon, we'll be relocating to my home country, and we plan to sell our house in the US. We already have a house in my home country. Originally, I thought about putting the money into a savings account (around 4.25% APY), but after seeing how well investing has worked for us, I'm starting to have doubts.  I've been browsing Reddit a lot and reading about S&amp;P 500 Index ETFs, which seem to offer low risk and solid returns. My bank also offers an investment account, and just for fun, I‚Äôve invested $500 to see how everything works and learn a little bit.  What would you recommend should we do with the money from the house sale? Should we put most of it with Putnam since it‚Äôs given us great returns over the years, or should I manage it myself using a fund like SPY or maybe put most of it in the savings account?  Thanks a lot for your advice!","How long will the money be invested until you want to spend it?  The stock market has been doing very well for a long time.  But the 10 years between 2000 and 2010 were ugly, and the S&amp;P 500 was not low risk.  How will you react if your investment drops 40%?  Because the market can drop 40%.  Average market returns are just an average, and in that average are some really great periods of time and some really bad periods of time.    I suggest that you look into the term ""asset allocation"".  A portfolio made up of different types of investments can give you a risk/return /volatility mix that you are comfortable with.    Finally, be careful with Reddit advice.  Everyone has different investment goals and background, and a lot of people are quick to advocate solutions that are really just validating their own decisions.","&gt;  If you had invested the money in an s&amp;p 500 index fund you‚Äôd have a lot more now.

Historically, over long time scales it has shown to be low risk but their is no guarantee that will always be true.   That said, I'd argue leaving your money sitting in a Savings Account losing buying power to inflation is extremely risky.

investing,Oct,1gegwdy,"69 YO sister was sold $2M in deferred annuities, left with only $200K in checking account","My sister was sold about $2 in annuities by her bank.  She told them she wanted to invest in something that guarantees no loss of principle.  So they sold her $1.2M in 5.15% annuities and $800K in 3% annuities.  She has a mortgage at 2.75 that she pays to the bank with $10,000 monthly mortgage payment on a $1.1M loan.  After fees the 3% annuities pay less than the mortgage.  They tell me it's so she can deduct the mortgage interest.  I was made trustee on her accounts and was pretty shocked.  Her expenses are about $50K a month and they wrapped up 90% of her money that she can't touch for 3-5 years.   She invests exclusively at this bank so they knew her finances.  The good news is that her salary covers the $50K a month, barely.   She sold her company for a $5M stock merger but can not sell the stock for 2 years.   Her home equity is about $2M  The bad news is that she has FTD (Frontal Temporal Dementia), hence the trustee bit.   The really bad news is that she has 3-5 years to live.  And how much longer she can work  I feel like the bank took advantage of he by tying up 90% of her cash.   Her net worth is around $10M so she now has about 2% of her money that she can access.

investing,Oct,1gacfdb,Is it still worth contributing to retirement after reaching 1.5M?,"Trying to do the math here and wondering if I'm missing something. 47M and not expecting to retire till 60-65. Have $1.5M in 401K and 403B and one taxable brokerage account. I plan to continue contributing to 401K due to employer match but in doing the math, it seems that there is not a huge benefit in making additional contributions to 403B and that growth really depends on compounding and market growth rate. Am I wrong in thinking that if I maximize contributions, I will only end up with $0.5M or less extra?   If initial investment is 1.5 million, 401K contribution fixed at $2000/month  At 5% growth I will have $2.8M in 10Y   With additional $2000/month to 403B, I will have 3.1M in 10Y.   At 8% growth, I will have $3.7M in 10Y   with additional $2000/month to 403B, I will have $4M in 10Y  This does not account for the tax savings in contributing to 403B but it seems that the extra monthly $2000 to the 403B is not really giving me a huge boost here. Am I wrong?  Thanks","I think you have some issues with your calculations. Not that the numbers are wrong, but you‚Äôre looking at it wrong.   First, if you don‚Äôt plan to retire until 60-65, you should be first looking at a 13-18 timeframe, not 10 years. Age 57 means nothing to you if you aren‚Äôt planning to retire until later. At 13 years with 5% growth, you‚Äôre looking at $3.3 mil vs $3.7 mil with the 403b contributions. That‚Äôs $400k, which I would say is a significant amount of money. At 8% growth, the numbers increase to $4.7mm and $5.3mm. A $600k difference.   If you don‚Äôt retire until 65, the numbers are even greater. At 5%, the numbers are $4.3mm vs $5mm, a $700k difference. And at 8%, you‚Äôre looking at $7.2mm vs $8.2mm, a $1 million difference. These are big numbers and big differences.   Additionally, you aren‚Äôt just looking at the number at the time of retirement. The money needs to last for ideally 30 years or more. So having more in the account means your money will obviously last longer.   More importantly, what you need to do is figure out how much money you plan to live on annually in retirement, then see how much you would need to save to keep up that lifestyle, accounting for inflation. By saving more now, you may hit that number earlier - meaning you could retire earlier. You need to make some estimates about what your expenses will be and then work towards what you would need in retirement to keep that lifestyle.","$400-600k sounds like a lot until you compare it to $5-8 million. If you continue with this logic the conclusion is that you should work until you're 80 because otherwise you'd be missing out on over $1 million incremental gains, and who is going to give up $1 million?  The person that wants to retire relatively early and enjoy their life, that is who. And it doesn't even necessarily mean retiring but to change their job so that it is easy, low stress, less than full time, with no chances for promotion and bonuses that you don't need. This is why you see a lot of people approaching retirement coasting in their jobs and enjoying their life, because another $25-50k of retirement contributions, raises or bonuses just doesn't make any difference any more.","This is totally true. This happened to my dad. He was 62 and met with a financial planner to see when it would be safe to retire. The dude was like, right now! Why are you working? So he retired. He had 4-5 years, then got brain cancer and died at 68.  We don‚Äôt live forever. Enjoy your years.","Yep when you have $100k saved for retirement, your $20k contribution is 20%, and a 10% increase in the market is $10k or half of your contribution.  But when you have $1.5M saved, that same $20k contribution is only 1.3% and a 10% increase in the market is $150k or 7.5x your contribution.  In other words your contributions start to become meaningless and all that matters is investment performance.  This also applies to things like raises and bonuses at work. You‚Äôre not going to kill yourself for a $50k raise or bonus because it just doesn‚Äôt matter.","It isn't like the money stops growing. If you retire and have $3M and you keep 75% of it invested, after 10 years you'll likely have more than you started with. I think the mistake that a lot of people make is waiting too long to retire.",Unless you underestimate how much you will spend each year!  And that's the big catch - guessing how long you will live and how much it will cost.   You have 40+ hours/week to fill after retirement. And most activities will cost money. So you'll save on work related costs but spend more to stay active and engaged with the world.,"What else would you rather do w the money? You cant really judge financial decisions in isolation. It's about opportunity cost.  Also, not sure why youre using 10 years when you have 13-18 until retirement. And even then, it's not like youre going to cash out 100%. So the time horizon is even longer.  5-8% is also a bit conservative (but not unreasonably so). 10% is closer to the market average.","Personally i would stop contributing, no offence but your best days off your future life are today! i would advice, work less hours,days a week, and spend time and your income on fun things with your family or something you really like. You can buy a lot of things at age 65 with 4 million but you can‚Äôt buy back time with family and time at age 47. You got a good portfolio that can compound further more than You can imagine.",I think taxes come into play here.  Do you want to pay income tax now or defer them to when you are potentially in a lower tax bracket. Could be a wash.  Who knows.,"You know, I‚Äôd never really thought about it like that. My dad always brought it up from the perspective that he should have gone to the planner sooner, but I should be more thankful he got the advice at all."
investing,Oct,1fxe0d2,"Buy, Borrow, Die Method, but how do you pay it back?","I understand the Buy, Borrow, Die method for wealthy people. What I dont understand is, once you have the borrowed money, how do you pay it off (make payments) if majority of your wealth is in the collateral and your (unsold) assets? Do they start selling little by little?",I explain it [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BuyBorrowDieExplained/s/bYDxomSgyA) in the FAQs.,"No good answers here yet, so it goes like this.  You have 100mm at a broker, they will loan you up to 50mm on that. You borrow 10mm for life and your assets keep growing. Your interest owed it just added to the balance due. So you only borrowed 10mm but end of year 1, you owe 10.5mm at 5% interest.  You let this all accumulate through your life. Borrowing as needed, never paying anything back because your 100mm of collateral has a basis of like 1mm and you won't want to pay the taxes.   When you finally pass away, that 1mm of basis gets a 100% step up to be 100mm of basis. So your spouse could sell all the stock the next day and pay 0 in taxes.   There is no estate tax on wealth passed to a spouse either. So, you end up tax free sale, repay that loan from all those years ago.","So the typical argument is someone inherits the family farm, but land prices have gone up 3x in the 40 years since papa bought the land and the son can't afford to pay half the value of the farm in taxes and keep it running so he's forced to liquidate.   Now that argument has a major flaw in that the first 10 million or so would be exempt anyway, so not a whole lot of regular folks would be running into this.   But really the law should also consider that when Bill Gates dies, Microsoft is not going to have to wind down when his heirs liquidate his ownership. Divisible assets like stock should be treated differently from indivisible or difficult to divide assets.","&gt; When you finally pass away, that 1mm of basis gets a 100% step up to be 100mm of basis  It's bananas to me that this is legal.  Like why on earth is the government not taking their cut?","Excellent read, and much more thorough than the answers I've seen before. I've bookmarked the post to refer others to it whenever this comes up again.","Because the wealthiest people who benefit from this are also extremely influential in tax code law. The government is made up of people, and the vast majority of the legislators that control this are either extremely wealthy, have their campaigns funded by the extremely wealthy, or both.","The products used in this type of planning are not sensitive to benchmark interest rates. The standardized securities backed loans/lines of credit marketed to the mass affluent (see e.g. IBKR) usually use a rate of SOFR plus 1-2 percent. The ‚Äúbuy, borrow, die‚Äù products issued by investment firms to people worth hundreds of millions or billions of dollars have interest rates approaching zero. The firm makes its money on stock appreciation rights associated with the underlying collateral, not interest.   These products are rarely callable before the client‚Äôs date of death. Sometimes, the client is required to put up more collateral if the underlying collateral plummets in value. This isn‚Äôt usually a problem because the proceeds from the product are typically invested in assets custodied with the firm that issued the product anyway.",That‚Äôs kind of what I was gathering from all the other answers lol. Thank you for thoroughly explaining it,"Once upon a time there was an actual estate tax.  So resetting the capital basis avoided double taxation.  This approach also worked well with things like farms and family businesses.    But now the estate tax exemption is so high, and so full of holes, that it does not really exist for practical purposes.  But surprise surprise, the wealthy still have the step-up in basis.  Compare this whole process to how your IRA/401k will be treated if/when your children inherit them.",Your estate sells some of the assets when you die to cover the loans.  As long as your assets grow faster than the interest rate there will be more assets than the outstanding loans.  However if the underlying stock takes a big drop in share price then the lender may require them to assign additional assets

investing,Oct,1fu1qjr,How to react to falling HYSA interest rates?,"Each week when I get paid, I throw maybe 5% of my check into my HYSA. I use Discover with an APY of  4.10% which was 4.25% APY when I first started. I understand that this will probably go even lower with the Fed seeming to have higher hopes for the economy and therefore wanting to lower interest rates. In my opinion, at an APY &gt; 4%, you are doing fairly well in terms of beating inflation (historically) and avoiding the ""risk"" of the market while still maintaining an emergency fund that is making decent money on its own.   At what point should one consider stopping the weekly HYSA deposits and perhaps even start some pulling money from the HYSA and deploying into the market? How low can a HYSA interest rate even go?",How low can it go?  HYSA were at practically zero for a decade after 2008. Statistics would tell you they usually pay +/-0.3% of the inflation rate.  This past year was an anomaly because the Fed raised interest rates quickly and the inflation rate dropped accordingly and so hysa earned a positive yield over inflation,"1. Keep enough cash as cash in your HYSA for emergencies(3 to 6 months generally). Doesn't matter the rate, it's for emergencies.  2. Invest the rest.","Japan has had negative nominal interest rates for over a decade until the BOJ decided to raise rates in the past few years.

Inflation is around 3% right now so you want to shave that off of your ROI and think of those accounts as giving you 1-2% interest.   Then you also need to consider tax implications. You'll likely be taxed at year end on the full 4-5% interest rate of cash you've received so you need to subtract that from your 1-2% ROI.   Your cash is, generally breaking even in it's purchasing power or maybe you're barely getting a little of top of that.   You'll also want to factor in your local real estate average annual increase in the housing cost as well.

Instead, I'm putting some funds generally into the market in non-tax-advantaged accounts. I took a gap year from employment in 2023 and it was *intensely* healing from burnout, so building up market-invested savings (beyond cash emergency funds) that I don't intend to use but can liquidate if needed is a good choice *for me*.

That's what's grown over time, along with what I've stuck in various tax-advantaged accounts.  Immigrant parents, so lots of emphasis on education. Grew up lower-middle class at best. Lived in a nicer neighborhood, but with 4 of us in a small house (my 2-bedroom apartment in grad school was bigger) that they didn't maintain so well and many years where we didn't have a car (challenging in the suburbs).  I more or less invested my college savings into the market starting when I was a young teen. When I started high school; I realized that it wouldn't be enough money. My sorta-clueless immigrant parents were reckless enough to let me take the money and invest it; I made quite a lot during the .com boom.

investing,Oct,1fzckr9,Are there better options than a HYSA for semi-liquid savings?,"Hi everyone,  I have read through MANY posts on here and several investing articles (most seem to be selling something). I am also still relatively new at investing outside of my 401K and Roth IRA. That is why I thought I would go ahead and post this question to get your opinions on this.  Here is a quick history... I was planning to pay our house off early, but with a 2.875% mortgage and interest rates going up I decided to put the extra in a HYSA. For the last couple of years it has been over 5% and just recently dropped below, with the latest Fed cut. Including the emergency fund, I now have about $150K in the HYSA. I also have a son graduating in May (and two daughters following in the 3 years following) and will likely need to pull from this to help with college expenses over the next decade.  My question is this, is there a better place to put this money now that HYSA rates are dropping? I expect they will continue to drop given the Fed's current direction. I have considered Dividend ETF's, MMF's, REIT ETF's, etc. I am a little nervous putting needed cash in a market ETF give the stellar run the markets have had over the last two years. At some point, one would think there has to be a correction. Some of the data appears to point to this, I think, but I am really a novice at this.

Thanks!",They're declining but people act like we're going back to 0% interest which is un likely. The rates are still pretty good for the foreseeable future.  You will not find low risk with 6-7%.

You don't have to be all short-term (cash/HYSA/money market funds), bonds (CDs; Treasurys; etc.), or equities (stocks).  Traditionally, something like 20% equity/80% bonds is considered ""conservative"" in its investment objective.  So, hypothetically, if you had $20k in a savings and would like some potential upside for a portion of it, you can allocate $4k into a wide market index like VOO/VTI/VT (I'd pick one) and leave the other $16k in your HYSA or money market fund.  Of course, you'd have to rebalance it, say one a month might be enough, so it stays within the target asset mix and you don't overexpose on one end or the other too much.  Of course, there's plenty of mutual funds and ETFs that will do all of this for you at the cost of a bit of higher expense ratio.  And if 20/80 is too ""aggressive,"" then adjust as needed."

investing,Oct,1fwgg7t,Dividend Irrelevance Theory,"There is a popular subset of the investing community that focuses on generating income through dividend paying companies. The goal is to create an income stream that can either supplement or replace active income from employment. Dividend-paying stocks often feel ""safe"" to these investors, as they provide regular, tangible cash payments, which activates certain reward centers in the brain. This stands in contrast to the perceived uncertainty and volatility of a total return approach, where investors must depend on fluctuating stock prices for their returns. But while dividends feel safe and reliable, there‚Äôs more going on under the surface.¬†  **Dividend Irrelevance Theory (Modigliani and Miller)**  The Dividend Irrelevance Theory, proposed by Modigliani and Miller (MM) in 1961, asserts that dividend policy has no impact on a firm‚Äôs value or cost of capital in a frictionless market. Under this theory, a company‚Äôs value is determined solely by its earnings power and investment decisions, not by how it distributes its profits. Whether profits are retained or distributed, the firm‚Äôs underlying valuation remains the same.  In an efficient market, a stock‚Äôs price converges to its book value per share plus the present value of its future earnings. When a company issues a dividend, it typically does so when it cannot reinvest its profits in any profitable investments. Therefore, expected future earnings should remain unaffected. This means that the share price should drop by the same amount as the dividend paid out, as the decrease in the firm‚Äôs cash holdings lowers the book value per share.  Empirical evidence, such as the drop in stock prices on the ex-dividend date, supports this theory. When a dividend is paid, the share price tends to decrease by the amount of the dividend, as cash leaving the company is reflected by a reduction in book value per share. This indicates that shareholders are not gaining extra value, just converting it from one form (capital appreciation) into another (cash). The key here is fungibility. There is no reason why $1 in the form of a dividend should be preferred more than $1 in the form of capital appreciation.  **The Role of Asset Pricing Models in Analyzing Dividend Stocks**  While Modigliani and Miller‚Äôs theory holds under certain assumptions, real markets have frictions, and historical data has shown that dividend paying stocks tended to outperform their non dividend paying counterparts. If dividends don‚Äôt inherently add value, why is this the case?  This is where asset pricing comes into play. I encourage you to see my post on Asset pricing for more information, but to give a brief summary, we have identified 5 factors which are believed to be proxies for excess exposure to underlying systematic risks that stocks with certain characteristics have. Stocks with higher exposure to systematic risk should have higher expected returns, as you are paying a deeper discount for future earnings. The risk factors are as follows.  1. **Market Risk (Mkt-RF)**: The excess return of the market over the risk-free rate (proxied by treasury bills) 2. **Size (SMB)**: The premium earned by small-cap stocks relative to large-cap stocks. 3. **Value (HML)**: The premium associated with high book-to-market value stocks (value stocks) over low book-to-market value stocks (growth stocks). 4. **Profitability (RMW)**: The premium associated with stocks with robust profitability over weak profitability stocks. 5. **Investment (CMA)**: The premium of firms with conservative investment (low asset growth) over aggressive investment firms.  Running what is called a factor regression, we can determine how much dividend paying stocks are exposed to the underlying risks these factors are proxying for, based on how a dividend paying ETF covaries with each factor premium. See below an example of this factor regression for Schwab‚Äôs US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD).  **Introduction**  # There is a popular subset of the investing community that focuses on generating income through dividend-paying companies.

This means that the share price should drop by the same amount as the dividend paid out, as the decrease in the firm‚Äôs cash holdings lowers the book value per share.  Empirical evidence, such as the drop in stock prices on the ex-dividend date, supports this theory. When a dividend is paid, the share price tends to decrease by the amount of the dividend, as cash leaving the company is reflected by a reduction in book value per share. This indicates that shareholders are not gaining extra value, just converting it from one form (capital appreciation) into another (cash). The key here is fungibility. There is no reason why $1 in the form of a dividend should be preferred more than $1 in the form of capital appreciation.  **The Role of Asset Pricing Models in Analyzing Dividend Stocks**  While Modigliani and Miller‚Äôs theory holds under certain assumptions, real markets have frictions, and historical data has shown that dividend paying stocks tended to outperform their non dividend paying counterparts. If dividends don‚Äôt inherently add value, why is this the case?  This is where asset pricing comes into play. I encourage you to see my post on Asset pricing for more information, but to give a brief summary, we have identified 5 factors which are believed to be proxies for excess exposure to underlying systematic risks that stocks with certain characteristics have. Stocks with higher exposure to systematic risk should have higher expected returns, as you are paying a deeper discount for future earnings. The risk factors are as follows.  1. **Market Risk (Mkt-RF)**: The excess return of the market over the risk-free rate (proxied by treasury bills) 2. **Size (SMB)**: The premium earned by small-cap stocks relative to large-cap stocks. 3. **Value (HML)**: The premium associated with high book-to-market value stocks (value stocks) over low book-to-market value stocks (growth stocks). 4. **Profitability (RMW)**: The premium associated with stocks with robust profitability over weak profitability stocks. 5. **Investment (CMA)**: The premium of firms with conservative investment (low asset growth) over aggressive investment firms.  Running what is called a factor regression, we can determine how much dividend paying stocks are exposed to the underlying risks these factors are proxying for, based on how a dividend paying ETF covaries with each factor premium. See below an example of this factor regression for Schwab‚Äôs US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD).  [Regression done on Portfolio Visualizer](https://preview.redd.it/y11ok31tmusd1.png?width=1562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e099f569509f42986d240b38bd9a351761e10f0b)  The regression results show that dividend payers have statistically significant exposure to the Market, Value, Profitability, and Investment factors, with high explanatory power (R¬≤ = 90.4%). The alpha, or unexplained return, is statistically indistinguishable from zero. This suggests that dividend paying stocks do not have unique value adding characteristics that cannot be explained by their exposure to these risk factors.  What this means is a dividend portfolio‚Äôs performance can be replicated through targeting the risk factors directly. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that dividend payers are safer investments, because this regression clearly shows that they are exposed to additional risk. See below a comparison of the returns of Schwab‚Äôs US Dividend Equity ETF and a hypothetical factor tilted portfolio with the same exposure to those risk factors.  https://preview.redd.it/uhifc7j0nusd1.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85ad46f5496dd6588a24aaa4440ef3ced5162665  You can see how closely they track each other. This goes against the conventional wisdom that dividend payers are safer. Dividend investors should reassess their asset allocation assuming they chose dividend stocks due to risk aversion.  **Why targeting risk factors directly is a better idea**  Given that dividend payers performance can be replicated by targeting risk factors like value, profitability, and investment, a more efficient approach might be to directly allocate to these factors through diversified factor based strategies. Here‚Äôs why:  * **More tax efficient**: Since dividend distributions are taxable, targeting these factors is often more tax efficient, especially in a taxable brokerage account. Capital gains taxes are only triggered upon sale and can be delayed into perpetuity, while dividends create an immediate tax liability. * **Broader Opportunity Set**: By targeting the underlying risk factors, investors avoid limiting themselves to dividend paying stocks, which tend to be concentrated in certain sectors like utilities, consumer staples for example. This broader opportunity set allows investors to gain exposure to value and profitability factors across a wider range of companies. * **Why Defer Spending Plans to Corporate Dividend Policy?:** Corporations never take into consideration your spending needs, so why rely on them? To repeat, the key here is fungibility. There is no reason to prefer $1 in the form of a dividend over $1 in the form of a capital gain. If you need money from your investment portfolio, you can sell your shares, and cater the plan to your needs. Dividend focused plans have no considerations of your actual needs. * **Market Inefficiency and Behavioral errors**: Investors often chase dividend yields during low interest rate environments, driving up the prices of high yielding stocks. This creates a temporary premium that is unlikely to persist long term. The preference for dividend stocks during low rate periods might reflect that the asset is overvalued due to the behavioral errors of investors. By focusing on these factors directly, investors can avoid the pitfalls of paying a premium for what is essentially an income preference rather than a sound investment decision.  Final note: This does not mean that dividends are inherently bad or that you should avoid them altogether. However, dividends themselves are an irrelevant criterion for investment selection. Investors should consider whether their preference for dividend stocks is driven by misconceptions around safety or income generation, rather than sound investment strategy.  A stocks value ultimately comes from its future earnings and risk characteristics, not from how it distributes cash.","This is well documented but too often ignores the behavioral story. There are people for whom dividends have psychological benefits, meaning the ability to hold equity at all is improved by knowing the dividends are coming in.",What you said is true.  However dividend stocks typically fit in the Value category and they do have substantially different characteristics than growth stocks.   Generally larger older companies with less volatility and more predictable cash flows or they wouldn't be paying dividends.  So if you are trying to make the point that only younger faster growing growth stocks are the only thing you should invest in I would call you Wrong.,They very explicitly are not trying to make that point.,I mentioned dividend payers tend to be value stocks. I had also mentioned that there is nothing wrong with dividends themselves but rather a ‚Äúdividend focus‚Äù causes certain inefficiencies.,"&gt;However, dividends themselves are an irrelevant criterion for investment selection.  that's not what Modigliani and Miller claimed.   Their research has been consistently distorted and misrepresented over the years.   &gt;**Note that M&amp;M didn‚Äôt say that dividends were irrelevant; they said, under their extremely narrow conditions, that dividend payout ratios should be irrelevant to the overall value of the firm. That is a specific finance claim, not a generalized disregard for dividend payments. It is not what M&amp;M said; it‚Äôs what people now think they said. There‚Äôs a big difference.**  Daniel Peris, *The Ownership Dividend* (Routledge, 2024)",The payout of dividends is derisking. You could ride a growth stock all the way up and then all the way down with nothing to show for it.,"&gt;&gt; historical data has shown that dividend paying stocks tended to outperform their non dividend paying counterparts. If dividends don‚Äôt inherently add value, why is this the case?  Life is not just about numbers.  And the differences between dividend payments and stock buy-backs involve a great deal more than math.  Dividends are usually distributed in a systematic way, and cutting dividend payments is seen as a very bad sign.  So, a dividend is in effect a statement by management that they believe the company can perform and continue to deliver into the future.  Boeing is a case study.  Prior to 1998 investment in new aircraft programs and the company's reputation was seen as a way to protect investors, and the dividend, well into the future.  Post 1998 the Jack Welch school that came to control the company was focused on short term results and stock buy-backs.  The difference between Boeing today and what is called in the industry ""legacy Boeing"" is stark.","This is actually a great point. Even if dividend investing is irrelevant to portfolio construction, if it gets them excited to put money into the markets, that that‚Äôs ultimately a good thing if the alternative is that they put no money into the markets.","I don't see why when ever someone mentions dividend irrelvance the counter argument is ""Oh so you are suggesting people only buy into growth stocks with PEs of 150""?  No , no one is saying that.","In certain countries (like Australia) dividends have special treatment from a tax perspective also, which makes it an attractive component of total return."

For instance, they glossed over why AAA ratings were being placed on collections of debt where the underlying was of middling credit quality.  Gaussian Copula modeling was so revolutionary and robust when it first came out in 99.  There was talk of David Li being on the short list for a Nobel soon.    Copula derived default risk from traditional factors, but it included geographical diversification.  Let‚Äôs say a mid credit loan in Detroit is risky, and so is a mid credit loan in Sacramento.  The risks of Detroit and Sacramento seeing a down market at the same time is less than the risk of either of them individually seeing one.  This sort of modeling has been used in insurance for decades, so it‚Äôs pretty mathematically sound.  So take that concept, the idea that geography offers diversified and reduces overall default risk, and run it out across thousands of and thousands of locations and tens of thousands of loans.  You can take something that was perhaps a default risk of ~10% and reduce that to next to nothing by isolating then diversifying your geographic exposure.   This worked amazingly well, like astoundingly well.  The problem was it worked too well.  Banks stopped worrying about the risks of individual mortgages and started mostly being concerned with proper geographical diversity.  This in turn increased demand across the board and loans started to become easier and easier to get everywhere.    There had never been an across the board downturn in real estate, not on a national level.  And most everyone believed this could never happen, because real estate markets were largely driven by too many local factors.    But, what Copula did was facilitate its own demise.  Because it created so much safety, lending increased everywhere, which made almost every local real estate market in the country become overheated.  Then the fed pushed up rates to combat an overheated economy- those legions of variable loans the banks issued because Copula told them they could started to default, and guess what?  It wasn‚Äôt geographically limited.    David li never got that Nobel.","Basically back then if you repackaged enough garbage together, they would claim magical built-in diversification was good enough to keep the monetized package from failing.

The bankers at the time failed basic maths  But the concept makes sense with uncorrelated shitty assets","My understanding (I haven't looked at this in 10 years or so) was that the copula modeling works and, in theory, works well for the application they used it for.    The problem was the selection of the Gaussian copula - it essentially creates a situation where the correlations between the risks function as independent of each other.  This is probably reasonable for many geographically diversified problems; you don't expect a ship sinking in a harbor in Hong Kong to affect the likelihood that a ship sinks in New York City.  But the home loan default risks all moved together, and worse, fed increased risk in a positive feedback loop as more defaults decreased property prices making walking away from mortgages more attractive.  A copula selection with fatter tail risk that contemplated a scenario like what happened would have better mitigated the problem because it would have significantly lowered the modeled price in the higher tranches which were the most significantly mispriced from a relative risk perspective.  There would have been far less fuel for the fire to build up 2003-06 because the asset quality of those tranches would have appeared far scarier to institutional investors than what they actually received (but much more in line with reality.)  All that said though, to the OPs actual question - I don't think the incentives for the rating agencies has changed.  They have an incentive to play for pay that hasn't gone away, and they generally don't assume any risk if they're incorrect.",dodd frank,"&gt; it essentially creates a situation where the correlations between the risks function as independent of each other.

investing,Oct,1g3dsl4,Anyone switched completely from dividend investing to index investing?,"I know most people do hybrid investments,IE both index and dividends. Some are index only investors.   But I am curious whether there are someone here switched completely from dividends investing to index due to total returns reasons . When I said ‚Äúcompletely‚Äù, I meant sold dividends portfolio and bought index","I was initially attracted to dividends because I liked the idea of passive income. Even after investing aggressively for many years, I realized that the amount I would need for dividends to make a difference in my life wouldn‚Äôt even happen for 15-20+ years. Given growth generally returns higher and the tax inefficiency of dividends over that time, I made the switch during the pullback last October and have been very happy with the decision since.","I remember as a kid (1980's) our class took a field trip to a local stock broker and then we spent a couple of weeks tracking investments in the the newspaper. The broker really promoted utility stocks for their dividends and reliable profit margin. But this was back when utilities were entirely regulated, held monopoly power in a fixed geographic region with limited opportunity for growth, and were essentially guaranteed a fixed profit margin. They didn't have anything better to do with cash than to pay dividends. Also trading costs were much higher, you paid a $30 commission to buy or sell shares and you had no idea what kind of bid/ask spread you would have to pay. It just wasn't cost effective to sell shares to withdraw income. This made dividends much more desirable since they were deposited into your account without paying the broker.   I think this mentality has hung around in the minds of advisors and investors but it's based on almost completely obsolete reasoning (at least for the US):  * Commissions effectively don't exist anymore.   * Index funds and ETF's, ubiquitous availability of real-time bid/ask quotes, electronic trading, and other developments have improved liquidity and reduced trading costs.   * Share buybacks have grown relative to dividends due to better tax efficiency. Buybacks are an alternative for returning value to shareholders even for companies with limited growth potential and reliable cashflow.  * In today's economy the companies with largest and most reliable cashflows are no longer utilities with limited with growth potential. They are tech companies that have alternative growth, acquisition, and investment opportunities where they can deploy their money.","most indexes will pay dividends., because most stocks pay dividends.   so it's not all or nothing. the S&amp;P 500 pays a dividend, as do the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. buy a total US market index like VTI, or a total global index like VT, and it will pay dividends every 3 months.",Growth until retirement then switch to dividends when you actually have enough money to live off the dividends.,"Dividends are not free money and are a forced taxable event. Targeting dividend stocks, specifically for the dividend, takes away your ability to decide when and how you want to realize taxable events.  There's no upside to this approach, only downside.",FWIW I have never invested for dividends. But dividends seem impossible to completely avoid with equities.,"I believe that with S&amp;P500, only about 100 stocks don't pay dividends. It could be possible to  pick individual stocks that don't pay dividends. But that doesn't work long term. Because stocks that didn't pay dividends start paying dividends.",Yes. You sell the shares you need to get money to live on.   You'd likely want some cash buffer to live on when the market goes down and replenish it when the market is up.   This will allow you to determine if you want your taxable even in Q4 of this year vs q1 of next year. Whereas with dividends you end up being forced for one or the other. And when the dividend is paid out the share price drops by the dividend amount.,"Dividends just come to me with owning stock, I personally reinvest inventing that is given to me by dividends either be in stocks, ETFs or Index Fund.","The totally unexpected accounts scandal at Wells Fargo, and the $15 billion asset write down at Kraft makes me think that individual stock picking carries more risk than the index for the average person."

Some good, too, but a lot of bad.  If you look up morningstar's risk rating definition: ""If two funds have precisely the same return, the one with greater variations in its return is given the larger risk score. In each Morningstar Category, the top 10% of funds earn a High Morningstar Return, the next 22.5% earn Above Average, the middle earn 35% Average, the next 22.5% earn Below Average, and the bottom 10% earn Low.

Some large growth funds are hugger, lower or on part with their category average while total market is a different category",A total stock market fund includes small and mid cap stocks which are riskier than Large Cap stocks. That's probably why.,"It's essentially a score of how much an asset is correlated with the broader stock market.   A beta of 0 means no correlation. A beta of 1 means 1-to-1 correlation. A beta of &gt;1 means a slight decrease in the market will lead to a large decrease in value. A beta of &lt;0 means the asset is expected to _increase_ in value if the market were to decline.   Beta is *not* a measure of absolute risk. An asset can have a beta of 0 if the value is uncorrelated with the stock market but still be very risky.  Low beta assets are quite nice since they act as a hedge against market crashes. The market accounts for this though, so low beta assets are more expensive and their expected return on investment is lower.","Beta is a much better wat to measure volatility/risk.   The beta of a total market fund such as VTI is 1.00, anything less volatile/risky will be lower than 1.00, anything morso will be higher than 1.00.   As an example the beta of SCHD, a fund comprised of value stocks is 0.77, so less volatile/risky than the total market."
investing,Oct,1gdls66,"When people say you need a 3-6 months worth of expenses saved as emergency fund, what exactly does this mean?","Hi everyone, I'm (23M) very new to a lot of adult budgeting and finance things as I just graduated college and got my first full-time job (though I've been investing for several years now). One thing I keep hearing about that I've never considered was that I need to have an ""emergency fund"" which would cover 3-6 months of expenses, and I'm a little confused about what exactly this means.  In terms of risk for this emergency fund, I don't want that amount of money just sitting in a bank because of the very low interest it would generate compared to a money market like SPAXX, but this is a zero risk ""investment"" to put into the bank because of FDIC. As for SPAXX, I'm holding onto this nest egg and getting 5% (or so) interest on it, but it isn't a zero risk investment though very very low (I understand Fidelity has only ""broken the dollar"" 3 times in history). Would you go even further than just a money market like with an ETF like SCHD or is that ""too risky"" for what should be a stable nest egg?  Another concern would be the level of liquidity needed for an ""emergency fund."" I don't imagine there are many emergencies where waiting the 1-3 business days for the EFT would be catastrophic considering I could just use a credit card in the mean time, but would it be a better idea to have a smaller nest egg (&lt;1 month expenses) in an immediately liquid position such as a traditional savings account with your bank?  Last question, should I be closer to the 3 or the 6 months of the 3-6 months range? Thanks","Look at all your essential expenses per month: rent, car payment, food, etc. Essential. Add it up. Multiply by 3 or 6 to be ‚Äúsafer‚Äù.   Keep this amount in cash in a high-yield savings account. You do not ‚Äúhave‚Äù this money. This is your safety net. You are walking on a high-wire in life, and something may happen - lose your job, get injured and can‚Äôt work, your parent is dying and you decide you must care for them full time, etc.   This money ‚Äúcatches‚Äù you when you fall.

There is some credibility to his thought process, but this is an absurd amount of risk to take on money that is literally put away FOR EMERGENCIES.   Saving an emergency fund is personal finance 101. This is not personal finance 101, and you don‚Äôt want emergencies in your life to be dependent on market conditions.","To answer your question about waiting ‚Äú1-3‚Äù business days for emergencies.

But if the game relies too much on luck it's still gambling (which is why Poker is still gambling, despite there being skill involved in it).  But where it really gets complicated and stupid is how stuff like fantasy sports betting was ""legalized"" (I put that in quotes because there's still some disputes about if congress ever legalized it, or if they legalized it by accident). Fantasy sports when you look at the odds and how often people win/lose looks very much like a game of chance that should be considered gambling just like poker, but congress kind of accidentally legalized it when legalizing office betting pools, that clause is the whole basis of fantasy sports being legal in many parts of the US.

Despite that, it's extremely volatile and is a space that's filled with scams/fraud.

If someone doesn't feel like they can stomach that risk and volatility, then it's completely understandable they stick with more traditional investment choices.  Overall, I think it's safer to stick with the two big cryptocurrencies: BTC &amp; ETH, which are both seeing acceptance by traditional financial institutions.

""The market always does what hurts the most people, I think the market will go sideways because everyone expects it to go up or down.""  2. ""I remember in 1973 every day in August was down. And we thought 'God this can't get any worse, then wouldn't you know it in September every day was down.""  Lol - imagine 60 days of every day going only down. It happened. Look it up.

investing,Oct,1fwtjde,Is money management underrated?,"I‚Äôm 22 years old living with parents rent free so I am very lucky. Most people aren‚Äôt in my position but I also know a lot of people that live with their parents rent free and make nothing of it. I‚Äôve been able to save up for a house whenever I move out as well as 6 months worth of spending saved up as emergency money. Other than that money I have a decent bit to invest. I‚Äôm realizing even if I start with as low as 5k investing. If I basically just from this point on while I live with my parents(next two years) invest my entire paycheck into index funds(as well as well as Roth and 401k), in 20-25 years just the index funds alone could easily be worth 750k-1.5 million. Really depends on my contributions. It‚Äôs okay if I live paycheck to paycheck till I‚Äôm 42-47 because by that point I‚Äôll have almost a million dollars waiting for me, which can then last me till my Roth and 401k. Not ‚Äúlast‚Äù but I can use that money to make more money while I wait for my Roth n 401k. Is my math adding up? Could I possibly ‚Äúretire‚Äù from being an employee at 42-47 if I stick to this plan? I‚Äôm just curious if there‚Äôs some big flaw in not realizing haha. The big thing is making sure I make enough extra money in my taxable account because I‚Äôll be taxed like crazy. Any thoughts or tips is very much appreciated!","I think what you're describing is 'coast FIRE'. In theory what you're saying works but it is inexact so being 47 with 600k kinda sucks if you could've had 1.5 mil by saving some more along the way. So I think when most people do coast FIRE they are a little closer towards to goal so that it's more of a sure thing (e.g. having 500k at 30, yea you're probably a lot safer in cutting back retirement savings).","I think you‚Äôve picked up on a lot of the core concepts that will set you up for success: save money early and often, be patient and let it grow, don‚Äôt over complicate your investment decisions, and take comfort in building a safety net.

Less than 1/2%.    There are other reasons which impact the value. Does the company have a lot of debt?  Well, debt isn‚Äôt a part of the PE ratio.  More debt means lower PE ratio.

Because while in itself, yes 1/10 = 10% EY, 1/5 = 20% EY, etc, but when using PE as a comparative ratio, I don't think higher necessarily means less profit?   Such as Company ABC has PE of 40 (say stock price is $200 and EPS is $5),   And Company XYZ has PE of 25 (say price is $100, EPS $4).     And suppose they both have 1M shares, so ABC  has $5M in earnings and XYZ $4M.  ABC has both a higher PE and higher earnings.    Wouldn't this just indicate that investors are willing to pay more per dollar of earnings for ABC stock, likely on the expectation of higher future earnings growth (or perhaps lower risk, etc) ?   Tbh, this always confuses me when someone references something like the current PE vs FWD PE forecast (say 25 vs 30), and they make some kind of assessment of the company based on that, but how can you when you don't know what they're implying is responsible for the increase to 30? (Numerator or Denominator or both).     Anyhow, on topic:  NKE vs ADDY is a juggernaut after a quick glance at their metrics.  NKE 5Y growth estimate is ~5% and ADDY is ~173%.   NKE profit margin ~10% , ADDY ~1%   Anecdotally, I've never worn Nikes and am Adidas diehard, and recently went to order a pair and was shocked at how expensive Sambas are all of a sudden. $142?!

Many if not most startups fail within a year or so. Good ideas do not equal commercial success. I'd be very, very cautious with this type of investment.

Ideally, you should have the previous step accomplished prior to later steps\*  Step #1 - General Bank Accounts  * ‚óè ¬†Open a checking and savings account with Capital One ‚óã Checking Account: ‚Äú360 Checking‚Äù ‚óã Savings Account: ‚Äú360 Performance Savings‚Äù (If names havechanged, make sure the account is a high yield saving‚Äôs account) * ‚óè ¬†Along with the checking account, you will receive a debit card to be able to  make purchases in person with  * ‚óã ¬†You will also receive a checkbook with personal checks * ‚óã ¬†For your debit card and checks, you can only spend what is in yourdebit card account  ‚óè Keep all of your savings in the savings account and keep $100-$500 in  your checking account   ‚óã When making a purchase with debit card or checks, transfer from  savings to checking   ‚óè The savings account will usually generate 2% to 5% interest per year  which will be paid monthly   ‚óã¬†Ex.¬†If you have $10,000 in your savings, 3% would pay you $25  each month ($300 for the year = 3%)  Step #2 - Emergency Fund  * ‚óè ¬†Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account    * ‚óã ¬†Ex.¬†$2,000/mo living expenses = $6,000-$12,000 minimum    * ‚óã ¬†A minimum regardless of living expenses is $5,000 * ‚óè ¬†(RECOMMENDED) If you want to ensure you do not spend your emergency fund, open a second high interest savings account with a second bank, transfer the full emergency fund balance there and forget you have it!  ‚ñ† I recommend CitiBank or Discover since I recommend their credit cards  Step #3 - Early Debt Pay Off   \*Skip this step if you do not have bad debt or your debt interest rate is below 2%\*  ‚óè Determine if/how much you can pay extra towards your debt per month ‚óã I recommend 30% of your income to be for saving/investing (I  consider paying debt in the ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù category   ‚ñ† If you have your emergency fund saved in full, you should put  30% of your income towards paying down bad debt   ‚óè Set up automatic payments (or reminders if not possible) to pay extra  towards debts   ‚óã¬†Ex. You have your emergency fund saved up and make $50,000/yr  after taxes. 30% of $50,000 is $15,000 to invest per year. You can set up an auto payment to pay an additional $1,250/mo towards your bad debt.  * ‚óè ¬†Examples of bad debt to pay off early include credit card debt, student loans and private loans/payday loans * ‚óè ¬†When you have debt, you are losing money to negative interest. If you are able to pay that debt off and then invest the money you were paying towards the debt, you not only are no longer losing money to negative interest, but you are gaining money from positive interest  ‚óã¬†Ex.¬†You are paying $300/mo towards credit card debt. $150/mo of that money is towards the interest. After you save and pay off that debt early, you now invest that $300 into  Step #4 - Credit Card  \*Skip this step if you are not disciplined with finances and may spend more than you have\*  * ‚óè ¬†Open a ‚ÄúDiscover It Secured Card‚Äù with Discover Bank ‚óã You will be required to put down a deposit which you will receive in7-10 months so long as you pay all payments ‚óã You cannot spend more than your deposit so I recommend a depositof $500-$1,000 ‚óã Connect your general savings account and set up an auto paymentto pay off the full balance every month ‚óã Subscribe to email notifications and manually pay off your accountevery time you get an email that your new statement is ready inaddition to the auto-pay * ‚óè ¬†Use the credit card for all possible purchases to get cash back (2% on gasand restaurants, 1% on everything else)    * ‚óã ¬†To be safe and not spend more than you have in your savings,always check your savings account prior to making a purchase tomake sure you have enough money    * ‚óã ¬†NEVER SPEND MORE THAN YOU HAVE IN YOUR SAVINGS * ‚óè ¬†After 7-10 months, you will receive your full deposit bank and your card limit will increase from that amount to a higher amount  ‚óã As a bonus, go into the discover app and request a higher limit every 6-12 months  ‚ñ† Based on your income, monthly expenses and job, the bank may give you a higher limit, which can improve your credit score  ‚óè With a secured card you can establish/improve your credit score ‚óã A breakdown of credit score is included later in this guide  Step #5 - Roth IRA Investment Account  \*You can only invest in a roth if your income is below the maximum requirement ($160k in 2024) and you are investing taxed income (you must have a job and it cannot be cash under the table)\*  * ‚óè ¬†Create an account with Fidelity and open a ‚ÄúRoth IRA‚Äù * ‚óè ¬†Determine the maximum amount you can invest each month based onyour income    * ‚óã ¬†I recommend 30% of your income to be saved and invested (If youare not saving for a large purchase or your emergency fund, the full30% should be invested)    * ‚óã ¬†$7,000 is the current annual maximum for a ROTH IRA (2024)($583/mo) * ‚óè ¬†Connect your general savings account and set up automatic investing to purchase two different mutual funds or ETFs every month    * ‚óã ¬†75% of the monthly investment should purchase FXAIX or ‚ÄúFidelity 500 Index Fund‚Äù (S&amp;P 500 / the US Stock Market)    * ‚óã ¬†25% of the monthly investment should purchase FSPSX or ‚ÄúFidelity International Index Fund‚Äù (the International Stock Market outside of the US)  ‚ñ† Make sure that dividends are reinvested automatically   ‚óã¬†Ex. Each month $400 is transferred from your general savings account with Capital one. $300 is invested into the US Stock Market (Fidelity 500 Index fund) and $100 is invested into the International Stock Market (Fidelity International Index Fund)  * ‚óè ¬†Never ever withdraw funds from this account or any other investment account if possible (unless retired or for dire emergency after emergency fund is empty) * ‚óè ¬†Stick to investing in low cost Mutual Funds or ETFs (the funds mentioned above). Investing in individual stocks can result in a better investment, however usually investing in a large fund that represents many companies (such as the entire US stock market or international market) will be the safer bet that nearly ensures you will get a solid return over time    * ‚óã ¬†Investing in individual stocks is gambling    * ‚óã ¬†Investing looking to make money in the short term (less than 10years out) is not investing. It is trading. Trading is gambling.  Bonus Steps for your 20‚Äôs:  1. If your employer offers a 401k match, always take it and invest the maximum match amount  * ‚óã ¬†This is more important/better than your Roth IRA and if you cannot do both, do the 401k match instead of the Roth * ‚óã ¬†If you can do both, invest the full 401K match and then invest the remainder of your investment funds into your Roth IRA2. Additional credit cards * 2.¬† ¬†If you are very responsible with credit cards, will never spend morethan you have, and always pay them off each month in addition to autopay, you can receive some better benefits with more cards‚ñ† 2nd Card - Citi Double Cash: 2% back on everything ‚ñ† 3rd Card - Citi Custom Cash: 5% back on one category ofchoice (I do gas personally) * ‚óã ¬†If you are an independent contractor or business owner, designate acredit card for all of your business expenses (so you can easily trackexpenses for write offs) * ‚óã ¬†I never recommend getting any credit card that has an annual fee  Additional Steps for your 30‚Äôs  \*Move on to these steps in your 20‚Äôs if you can\*  1. Hire a financial advisor   If you make enough to where you can invest more than the Roth IRA annual maximum, you should hire a financial advisor   Make sure they are a fiduciary advisor   A cheap option is to hire them only for flat fee based financial planning (general guidance instead of them doing the investing for you)  2. Start investing in bond funds   Change your automatic investments in your Roth IRA so that your stock allocation is 120 minus your age  * Ex.¬†30 year old is 120 - 30 = 90% stocks 10% Bonds * Ex.¬†50 year old is 120 - 50 = 70% stocks 10% Bonds With your new bond allocation %, set up your auto investment to purchase FXNAX or ‚ÄúFidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund‚Äù Every 5 years, adjust the automatic investment to align with the 120 minus your age rule  3. If you can afford to invest more than the Roth annual limit, contribute more to your 401K  ‚óã OR other great options include:  * HSA: Pre and Post Tax Investment account that can only bespent towards healthcare and medical costs (Tax benefits ofROTH IRA and 401K combined) * 529 College Savings Plan: Post tax investment account (likeRoth IRA) that must be spent on a family member‚Äôs education costs (use to save for kid‚Äôs college)4. Save up for and purchase a home * ‚óã ¬†While still contributing to your investment accounts, start settingaside funds monthly to save up to purchase a home * ‚óã ¬†Use your emergency second savings account or a 3rd savingsaccount so that you don‚Äôt accidentally spend the money  Saving Tips  Saving is, in my opinion, the most important aspect to one‚Äôs financial health. You must save to establish your emergency fund. You cannot pay off debt without saving the money to pay it. You cannot safely use a credit card without having savings. You cannot invest without saving that money first.  Living below your means can allow you to have less stress in your life, choose a lower paying, but more enjoyable career path, spend money on ‚Äúthe big important things‚Äù, afford to cover emergency costs, pay for incredible experiences, retire at a reasonable/early age and actually afford to raise children.  As of 2024, 56% of Americans do not have savings to cover a $1,000 emergency (per CNBC and FOX). For many young people, in my eyes, making money isn‚Äôt the issue. It‚Äôs actually saving money. Saving money is very simple. However, it‚Äôs also very hard at the same time. If you spend less than you make, you will save money. We all know that, however, what makes it so difficult is the emotional side of it. You have to get out of your comfort zone and make changes to the way you think if you want to change your spending habits into saving habits.  Tactical Tips:   Before you buy anything, ask yourself if you actually need it -¬†You were  living before, weren‚Äôt you?  Wait to Buy Something -¬†Impulse purchases are deadly. If you really want it that bad, you will still want it a week or month from now. The bigger the purchase, the longer you should wait.  Have a spending account and a savings account -¬†Only make payments out of your checking account and only transfer from your savings when you need to. An even better method is to open a second high yield savings account with another bank. Then you can put your savings there and forget about the money. That way you can keep your spending money in your general savings account and collect interest on both saving and spending funds.  Don‚Äôt Window Shop -¬†Window shopping can be a fun way to pass time, however if you are going into a store without the intention to buy a specific item you need, every single thing you end up buying is unnecessary. Or if you need a specific item, go straight to that item and straight to the register. Don‚Äôt browse!  Review your Expenses -¬†Simply take 5 minutes to review your bank or credit card statements once a month. You might be shocked at how much you are actually spending. You might also find old subscriptions you can cancel.  Set up an automatic savings transfer from your spending account to your savings account -¬†If possible, time this with your paycheck deposit. Just like with an automatic transfer to your investment account, you can just forget you have the money and you never even see it! You don‚Äôt miss the taxes taken out of your paycheck so you want to have the same setup with your saving/investing.  Mental Shifts to Tell Yourself Before you Spend Money:  ‚ÄúStop using material things to fight insecurity‚Äù -¬†Everyone wants nicer cars, homes, clothes, the list goes on. Why? Mostly because of status. We put our own value in our material possessions. Be that confident 70 year old that wears what‚Äôs comfy, drives an old, reliable car, and lives in a quaint, outdated home. Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre old to realize what‚Äôs really important. Work on that now.  ‚ÄúThe little things add up‚Äù -¬†$2 here, $5 there, $13 here. Next thing you know, your credit card statement is $800.  ‚ÄúWould I rather this small thing now or this big thing later?‚Äù -¬†Would you rather an expensive gym membership or would you rather a second vacation each year? Would you rather go out to dinner and drinks every week or would you rather be able to save up and buy a house?  ‚ÄúHow many hours/shifts of work does this cost?‚Äù -¬†Is buying that dinner worth it if it cost you an entire day‚Äôs work? Is spending an hour of work worth buying your lunch out vs bringing it from home? Is an expensive vacation worth 2 months of hard work or should you go the cheaper route? This also works great for commission jobs. How many cars/apartments/ect. would I have to sell to buy this?  ‚ÄúSaving is a tax free way of ‚Äúmaking‚Äù money‚Äù -¬†You can either work to make $130 and get $100 after taxes or you can just save the $100.  ‚ÄúWhat is more important to me, having nicer things or being stress free financially?‚Äù -¬†Is that second vacation worth the stress of running up a credit card you cannot pay off? Is that daily starbucks coffee worth the stress of paying rent late? Is that nicer car worth the stress of not being able to afford to move out of your parents?  ‚ÄúIf I invested this money today instead of spending it, I would have X when I‚Äôm older‚Äù -¬†Use a compound interest calculator to understand generally how much your money will grow until retirement. When you are a 20 year old, each dollar you invest now should grow about 20 times itself by age 65 (10 times itself as a 30 year old). If you are 20, ask yourself if you want to spend $1,000 on something you don‚Äôt need now or have $20,000 to spend on something when you are older.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stealing money from the future me/family‚Äù -¬†What do you value more, the novel item you don‚Äôt need right now or something you care more about in the future? Would you rather drive a nicer car now or would you rather be able to vacation every year after you retire? Would you rather spend money on yourself now or your family in the future?  ‚ÄúInstead of buying this every day/week/month, I invested it, how much would I have later?‚Äù -¬†How much money could you invest if you downgraded from a $100 gym membership to a $20 membership? How much money could you invest if you got a car with a $300 monthly payment instead of $500? How much could you invest if you split rent with a roommate to pay $1,000/mo instead of $1,800. Someone who buys a $6 coffee five days a week could instead invest that $30 per week to have over $350,000 extra at retirement.  If you like to gamble/buy scratch tickets:¬†‚ÄúDo I want an impossible chance to have $100,000 today or do I want an almost guaranteed $100,000 in 30 years‚Äù¬†- A 30 year old who spends $20 per week on scratch tickets will very likely never win big even if their habit continues for life. However, if that person invested that $20/week starting at age 30, they would likely have $113,000 at 60.  Brief Guide to a 750 Credit Score  A credit score is extremely important, however it‚Äôs something that there is a lot of confusion about. While many know what a credit score generally is, most don‚Äôt know all of the factors that determine the score and thus how they maintain a high score.  First off, a credit score or ‚ÄúFICO‚Äù score is how businesses and financial institutions like banks determine how qualified you are for certain services. Your credit score will be a factor in determining not only if you can get a loan for things like a car, house, ect. but also can determine what your interest rate will be on that loan. You also can be required to have a credit score to finance purchases like appliances and furniture or very commonly in order to rent an apartment. The higher your credit score, the higher the likelihood that a landlord will let you rent their apartment and later on, the cheaper your car and home will be.  Building a good credit score can take a very long time, however ruining your credit score can happen in an instant and can often take many years to repair. The easiest and most common way to lower your credit score is by missing a payment. This is why it is so crucial that you have autopay setup on all of your loan payments and credit cards.  If you have a bad credit score, you may find yourself unable to rent an apartment, buy a home, or buy a car. This is because you are seen as risky and untrustworthy. If your score is fair but not good, you will find yourself paying high interest rates. Because of this, you want to maintain a score above 700.  Credit Scores are typically seen as follows:  300 - 579 = POOR   580 - 669 = FAIR   670 - 739 = GOOD   740 - 799 = VERY GOOD 800 - 850 = EXCELLENT  When it comes to apartments, you generally need to fall into ‚Äúgood‚Äù or better to rent. In order to get the best interest rates on loans for cars/homes you generally need to fall into the ‚ÄúVery good‚Äù category or better.  Credit scores are determined by the following categories below. The percentage represents how much this category makes up a score and so a higher percentage means a more important category.  Payment History - 35%   Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - 30% Length of Credit History - 15%   New Credit Opened - 10%   Credit Mix - 10%  What each category means and how to do well in each:  Payment History¬†- How often have you made payments on time?  1. Never miss a payment. Set up autopay AND manually pay off monthly. 2. Open cards sooner. The longer a card has been on your history the morerecorded payments on your history. 3. Have more cards/loans. The more lines of credit, the more on timepayments. Don‚Äôt close card accounts for this reason.  \*If you do miss a payment, #2 and #3 help. Having many total payments makes your percentage of late payments smaller.\*  Ex. If you have one credit card for 10 months and miss one payment, you‚Äôre late 10% of the time. If you have 5 credit cards for 5 years and miss one payment, you‚Äôre only late 2% of the time (1/10 vs 1/60)  Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed¬†- How much of your total credit limit are you spending? (credit cards) / How much do you owe? (Loans)  1. Pay off your cards in advance of the statement date. Manually or with autopay, pay most or all of your current balances so that the balance is very low compared to your limit.¬†Ex. If your limit is $1,000 and you have a $900 balance, your utilization rate on that card is 90%. If you pay $850 of the balance before the statement period ends, the statement balance will be only $50 which is just 5% of your limit. 2. Have more credit cards. The more cards, the higher your total limit. This is another reason why you should not close a credit card. 3. Ask for limit increases. You can easily do this right in your banking app or call from a phone. Income, expenses, and credit score will determine the increase 4. For amounts owed, you really can only pay off debt. Save money so you can pay it off ahead of time. Don‚Äôt just make minimum payments.  Length of Credit History -¬†How long is your average line of credit?  1. Open up lines earlier in life. If you know you will get a certain credit cardeventually, get it now. 2. Be smart about timing of new lines. When possible, do not acquire newlines of credit prior to a life event that requires good credit. 3. Have more lines. When you open a new line of credit it does not affect you as much with more lines since that line represents a smaller percentage ofthe total amount of lines.¬†Ex.¬†A second credit card is 50% of your lines, however a 10th line of credit is only 10% of your lines.  New Credit Opened -¬†How recently have you opened a line of credit? 1. Follow the same first two tips above for ‚ÄúLength of Credit History‚Äù  Credit Mix -¬†Is the mixture of types of lines of credit diverse?   1. Have different types of lines of credit. There's mainly revolving (credit  cards) vs installment (loans).¬†Ex.¬†It‚Äôs better to have a mortgage, car loan and two credit cards rather than just 4 credit cards  Payment history is the most important by far and so it‚Äôs crucial to stay on top of all lines of credit and ensure payments are being made and made on time. If there is an accident and a payment is not made or made late you can actually call your creditor and potentially have them remove the late payment.  Keep in mind that you should never make bad financial decisions in order to increase your credit score. You also don‚Äôt want to complicate your finances. With one or two lines of credit, you can easily get a good score after just a couple years of on time payments.  Credit should not be taken lightly. If you are not financially responsible, do NOT get a credit card. The benefits are not worth the consequences of bad credit or even worse, snowballing credit card debt.  Compound Interest Explained (Why you Should Invest)  Saving is necessary in order to invest, however investing is much more powerful. When you invest, you are paid a percentage yield.   In other words, your money grows. But the beautiful thing about the growth is that it is not linear. It is exponential.  A simplified example of this can be with a high yield savings account and $100. Let‚Äôs say the savings account has an annual yield of 5%. That means after one year, the savings account would have given you $5. However, in year 2, you do not get $5. Why? Because you are no longer being paid 5% of $100, you are being paid 5% of $105. 5% of $105 is $5.25. The next year you are paid 5% of $110.25 which is $5.51. Each year you are paid more and more because the interest compounds on top of itself. Compounding interest!  Saving on the other hand, is linear. Fortunately, high yield savings accounts do have compound interest, however the annual yield is typically much much lower than stocks and checking accounts don‚Äôt have any interest at all. If you were to save $100 every month, rather than investing it, it would look like the blue line on the chart above. However if you invested it, the growth would compound on top of itself and look like the red line.  ¬†¬†  Example -¬†A $5,000 one time investment at 7% interest per year:   \*The first number is the new amount and the second number is the amount gained in the 5 years\*¬†Year 5 - $7,012 (+$2,012)   Year 10 - $9,835 (+$2,823)   Year 15 - $13,795 (+$3,959)   Year 20 - $19,348 (+$5,553)   Year 25 - $27,137 (+$7,788)   Year 30 - $38,061 (+$10,924)  In the first 5 years, the $5000 would grow an additional $2,012. However in just the final 5 years (from year 25 to 30), the investment would grow an additional $10,924. That is over double the original $5,000 alone! Compound interest!!  If you contribute $7,000 annually to a Roth IRA from age 20 to 65, with an average annual yield of 7%, you would have approximately $2,140,262.34 by the time you reach age 65. Tax Free! (\*7% is a decent inflation adjusted estimate of growth based on investing in the US Stock Market\*)  Because of the fact that compound interest gets better and better the longer it works, the earlier you start investing the better. Not just better, but much better. The downsides of starting later are also exponential (same math but backwards).  Example -¬†$5,000 invested per year at 7% interest per year: (at different ages)¬†\*The amount next to the age is the total amount the fund would grow to by age 65\*   18 Years Old - $1,881,579.00   20 Years Old - $1,633,771.07  25 Years Old - $1,142,920.14 30 Years Old - $792,950.21 40 Years Old - $365,519.51 50 Years Old - $148,235.43  Each year matters a lot. The difference between starting at 18 and 20 years old is $253,808 even though you would only invest $14,000 in those two years at 18 and 19. Start as early as possible! Even if it's only $100 a year.  By the way, if you start saving $5,000 a year at 18 instead of investing it, you would only have $235,000 instead of $1,881,579. Don‚Äôt just save!  Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA (401k)  Roth IRA taxes income but not stock growth (‚ÄúPost tax‚Äù)   Standard IRA (401k) taxes stock growth but not income (‚ÄúPre tax‚Äù)  When you are young, your income is usually low, but the investments you make will grow a lot by the time you retire. You want the low income to be taxed and not the high stock growth.  When you are older, your income is usually higher and since your investments do not have as much time to grow until retirement, the growth is low. You want the low stock growth to be taxed and not the high income. In conclusion, when you are in your 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs it is generally better to invest your money in a Roth IRA  \*remember that if your employer offers a 401k match, invest the maximum amount that will be matched by the company and invest the remaining money you can into a Roth IRA - The match is better than the tax savings of a Roth\*  Example #1 - Roth IRA  Income: $50,000   Age: 25 (40 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $5,000   Amount at Retirement: $74,872  Example #2 - 401k  Income: $100,000   Age: 50 (15 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $7,000   Amount at Retirement: $19,313  In example #1, you want to be taxed on the $50,000 income and not the \~$70,000 of tax growth. In example #2, you want to be taxed on the \~$12,000 of stock growth and not the $100,000 of income.  || || ||**INCOME**|**STOCK GROWTH**| |**YOUNG**|**LOW**|**HIGH**| |**OLD**|**HIGH**|**LOW**|  Free Resources: (all links removed)  \*Credit Karma - App/Website: (See your full financial picture on one screen)   -Net Worth Overview   -Free Credit Reporting  -Expense Tracking  \*MoneyChimp‚Äôs Compound Interest Calculator - Website:  (See how much money you will have invested in the future)   -Project out your current investing to see amount at retirement   -Understand how much each dollar will grow from your current age to retirement age (Ex.¬†20X from 20 to 65 and 10X from 30 to 65 (at 7%))  Nerdwallet - App/Website:   (Learn all about personal finance and find financial companies)¬†-Articles/Resources for improving personal finances (budgeting, saving, investing)   -Research and compare financial institutions (bank accounts, trading accounts, credit cards, insurance, ect.)   -App is similar to Credit Karma (however does not work with Fidelity as of 2024)  Investopedia - Website:(Understand Financial Terms)   -Full dictionary of financial terms with detailed explanations and videos -Articles on all things finance and personal finance  ¬†¬†  Video Library :  1.

investing,Oct,1gaegis,What's going on with long-term bond interest rates?,"On September 16, the 10Y interest rate was 3.6%. Today, it's 4.2%. That's a huge increase in less than 2 months. Particularly as short-term rates, which the Fed has strong influence over, are still expected to decline within the next year.  What's going on?",The yield curve is going to correct itself as the Fed takes the foot off the throat of the short term rates.   There's multiple forks predicting it could float back to just below 5% by year end with short term rates hovering around 4%.   This is what you want it to look like as a long term investor,"The 10yr was 3.75% on the 1st of October, now sitting at just under 4.25% with the FOMC having just cut 50bp, and at least 1 or 2 more 25bp cuts expected into year end. Mind boggling stuff. The only insight I can give is to watch the recent interviews with Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller. I have been of the same opinion with them for quite some time. In a nutshell the U.S. spending/deficits are reaching a tipping point, and it looks like the bond market is not happy. If rates continue to creep higher, we could be in for some fireworks.  Also keep in mind that there is a string of very large risk events coming up over the next couple of weeks.  Elections in Japan this weekend.  BOJ meeting next Thursday.  Non-farm Payrolls next Friday.  The U.S. election on Tuesday the 5th November (Guy Fawkes Day!).  FOMC and the BOE meetings on Thursday the 7th November.  Of course, the ongoing situation with Israel in the Middle East is constantly percolating, with the ever present threat of strikes on oil and nuclear facilities.  Massive amounts of uncertainty here, and that may also be playing into things, with large funds de-risking ahead of the potential volatility.  But equities don't care. Steve Sosnick's daily note headline yesterday ""Buy dips, chase rallies, lever up"". So many uneducated (uncaring perhaps?) investors just following the herd without any regard for what is happening in the world. If the market has a bit of a wobble, I can envision a significant market correction, that could shock many with it's speed and magnitude.  Best of luck.",Sure. Tell that to my refinancing dreams.,The guy whose promising everyone a tax cut and adding over 15t to deficit while tanking the economy with 1920 style tarrifs for no reason is having an impact on long term rates....,"Refinance rates are higher than mortgage rates. And I couldn't refinance yet, unfortunately, or I would have at the lows.","You need to remember that anticipated interest rate cuts (and increases) are priced into yields before they happen.

We're in ""good"" times, and yet:  ""The deficit came despite record receipts of $4.9 trillion, which fell well short of outlays of $6.75 trillion.  As a share of the total U.S. economy, the deficit is running above 6%, unusual historically during an expansion and well above the 3.7% historical average over the past 50 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

investing,Oct,1fwcxar,Is there any advantage to opening a brokerage account if I already have a 401K and Roth IRA?,"Right now I'm 26 with a net worth of over $100K. I have $27K in my Roth IRA (Already maxed) and $34K in my 401K. I have like $50K in cash right now making 4.5% interest in a HYSA. I just bumped my 401K contributions to 10%, I get a 3% match. I previously only had it at 6%. I would like to just index most of my cash savings in stocks, but is there any advantage to having a brokerage if you already have other retirement accounts? Or would it just make more sense to start doing a lot more into my 401K? I make $26 an hour and live on my own, renting out an apartment.","Nice thing about a brokerage account is there aren‚Äôt any restrictions. What you give up in tax advantages, you get flexibility. It is a good place to invest for a variety of purposes: money market funds for short term needs/emergency fund, aggressive growth for the long term, etc.",Do you want to build money you can use before retirement? That's a decision you gotta make.,Brokerages are still for investments. Your emergency fund should not be invested (unless in something secure obviously). Sitting in an HYSA is a perfect place for it,"House, car replacement, marriage, vacations, children... there are a lot of big expenses between age 26 and retirement.","I prefer a money market fund to HYSA. They tend to have higher yield, mine is at 5% right now and they are more tax efficient. A money market fund that invests in treasuries is except from state and local taxes whereas a HYSA doesn‚Äôt have any tax benefits.   To answer your question more directly. What is the $50k for? If it is your emergency fund, keep it there. If your fund is overfunded, take some and invest in an S&amp;P500 etf. Assuming you don‚Äôt have any high interest debt which in that case I‚Äôd start paying that down","Open no-fee brokerage now, is my vote.  I'm going to be in the minority here, but half your net worth in only an HYSA is not something I would do or recommend, especially with that HYSA yield dropping lower real soon now.  Take 1/3 or 1/2 of that and put it in stocks.  Then start rebuilding to the desired EF balance. But 50K is too high probably, what are you basing that on?  Also make sure you have some untapped credit cards to use in a true emergency to give you a few days for selling equities to get into your checking to pay off the expenses.",So would a brokerage be better for an emergency fund vs a HYSA?

Or how to even set one up lol I have an HYSA atm giving me 4.5%.,"Yes the brokerage is where your after tax dollars go.

When I first signed up for Robinhood, they were the only ones doing free trades (at least that I can remember. It's been almost a decade, I guess). That changed pretty quickly, but not until after I had already made an account.   Others for other signup incentives.   Others I joined because they offered things other brokers didn't at the time that I wanted to take advantage of -- fractional shares come to mind, for example.   Realistically, I would like to get down to 1-2, maybe 3. I don't want just one in case something happens to it and it gets locked up for one reason or another and takes time to resolve. I want to have access to my money (although most of my stuff is in retirement accounts, and I'm not at a proper age so maybe it doesn't matter). Just not worth the hassle for multiple, even if I don't have anything in them. I'm always afraid I'll forget one at tax time (I get its irrational/ways to prevent that. Doesn't change my concern). I guess the thing that disappointed me, was with Robinhood I tried to close my account, and they basically said too bad, not gonna do it. Deactivate, yes, completely close and delete info, nope. I think that has to do with know your customer regulations, though, so not necessarily their fault. Just kinda making me regret having my info spread around to so many brokers.","I use multiple platforms, including a portfolio OTC manager for over the phone deals.   I never, ever, understood why someone wants to 'limit' themselves to 1 broker. Because all you do is telling yourself, perhaps there are 10.0000 trade-able assets, and my broker offers 4.000 - that is enough.   All I think; we live in a globalized world and every country (fixed income) - fx - debt - equity - the whole product chain is correlated. So all you do is basically limiting your own potential. To me it makes absolutely no sense at all; because all you have to do is code a simple gui to collate the various brokers."
investing,Oct,1g3zrr0,"China economy is going to crash if it wants to bump the property price, and it doesn't have property tax as well","China economy is going to continue to crash if property price goes up again, and there's no property tax. The current price-to-income ratio is 20-30.  China seems to reverse their stance on making property price to fall, they want the price to stabilize and rise in the long term. But I think this is going to be a toxic medicine.  This is because with a falling property market, people generally felt ""poorer"" and cut their spending and economy becomes bad in general. Thus China wants to stimulate economy by making people feel ""wealthy"" again.  The problem is, even after this devastating property price drop, the property average price-to-income ratio in China is still 20-30, even in poorer cities. In simpler words, citizens need 20-30 years of salary to purchase a home. To compare, US has an average ratio of 4 and New York is 10, most European countries is 5-10 as well.  So bumping the property market isn't a healthy solution in the long-run, teaching Chinese citizens to long-term invest in stocks will be, if the main goal is to make citizens feel ""wealthy"" and spending more.  In addition, China doesn't have a property tax like United States, so China cannot charge properties at a 1-2% yearly tax on their net worth. So even if property prices go up, it won't really benefit the government much, nor citizens (Because most people own and live in 1 home).  I understand the difficulty faced by the Chinese government, because there are too many stakeholders on high property prices, it's impossible to just make property price fall to a 5-10 price-to-income ratio in short term. However, this will be at the expense of everybody, including homeowners.  Let me know your thoughts, or correct me if I'm wrong.",The problem is: The government basically can do nothing about the structural problems.,Investing in Chinese stocks is no panacea. Investing in US or EU you generally have reasonable accounting rules about performance and expected future earnings/liabilities. That isn't a thing there.,"In China you don't have 2 adults trying to buy a house, you could have up to 14 (6 from each side plus the original 2) to support a new home for new weds.  So 20-30 ratio can still be afforded.  Their parents/grandparents also dies and each couple can inherit multiple houses. Without siblings to dilute, it a huge sum of wealth. Plus mortgages for extra spending or additional housing investments.  In Chinese culture, kids aren't left to fend for themselves when they turn 18. They're supported till death","""To compare, US has an average ratio of 4""  Really?",Maybe but I doubt it. Birth rate is still insanely low,"Interesting you bring up inheritance ramifications.

My own fear-greed index of the biggest auto parts companies --&gt; [https://ibb.co/5rypgSQ](https://ibb.co/5rypgSQ) ...(0 means covid crash fearful... 100 means extreme greedy and enthusiastic)  What's the narrative on the auto parts sector?       Companies like Advanced Auto Parts have to restructure their entire business but the entire sector was hit pretty hard.,I would suspect the trend of cars being more complex requiring people to rely on dealership maintenance is part of it. Also coupled with new car purchases being incentivized rather than maintaining a vehicle through a reasonable lifespan. Just a thought based on anecdotal observation. The real answer is I don‚Äôt know.,Usually that increases demand; people buy more used cars instead of new cars.,"Online doesn‚Äôt actually work that well.

A lot of it is heavy parts and very specific SKUs that don‚Äôt move much. Sure oil filters, wiper blades, etc can be online. But those have been available in Walmart for decades without impacting the business. It‚Äôs not really viable for Amazon to keep that inventory taking space in a DC.

When things are bad he is busy because people need to fix their old cars up. When things are good people wanna fix up their old cars and or fix their new cars.,"In my opinion, continued effects of COVID are probably the largest factor.  During the height of COVID in 2020/2021, new car sales were heavily impacted - supply chain (especially semiconductor) shortages greatly reduced the availability of new cars, while financially-impacted consumers were not in a strong buying position.  The auto parts market experienced some of their best years, as more people turned to increasing repairs of their existing vehicles.  As the economy and supply chains have now more thoroughly stabilized/recovered, the availability of new cars has increased and consumers are reaching a point where they either have to replace, or are otherwise in a better financial position to opt for buying new vehicles.  With more new vehicles covered by manufacturer warranties, there‚Äôs less aftermarket repair parts sales.  The market may be rough for these companies for the next couple of years‚Ä¶  Considering a likely sizable portion of current and recent buyers are doing so because they have to, German carmakers mainly positioned as luxury brands in the major U.S. market may not be catching as much of the resurgence of new car demand.  VW is presumably still experiencing reputation issues.",ev adoption is irrelevant as they are not easilyb reparable as ice.,"I‚Äôve worked in this industry for five years and witnessed the period before, during, and after COVID.  Before the pandemic, everything was straightforward‚Äîparts availability was nearly perfect, and 99% of out-of-stock items could be sourced overnight.   During COVID, we began to see delays, with essential parts sometimes taking days, weeks, or even months to arrive. Basic tools like bits and wrenches became scarce, often taking months to be delivered. To cope, we started shipping incomplete toolsets and sent the missing pieces as they became available. Despite these challenges, business was strong during this time, as people had disposable income and invested in vehicle maintenance, even when it wasn‚Äôt urgent.  Post-COVID, we saw a sharp decline in non-essential maintenance. When faced with costly repairs, many customers opted to buy new cars, a trend accelerated by cheap vehicle leases. These leased vehicles won‚Äôt hit aftermarket shops until their leases or warranties expire, typically 3-4 years later, reducing current workload. Inflation and higher wages further raised workshop labor rates, while increased material costs led to even fewer repairs, with customers only addressing urgent issues for vehicle inspections or to keep their cars running. I‚Äôve even read that the average tire tread depth is lower now compared to during COVID, which could be a dangerous trend.  TL;DR: Before COVID, parts were easily accessible. During the pandemic, we saw delays, but business was good. After COVID, rising costs and cheaper leasing options led to a sharp decline in vehicle repairs, with customers focusing on only essential maintenance.",I don‚Äôt think anyone buys auto parts anymore except professional shops and high skill car enthusiasts. There is virtually no casual mechanic work done in the USA compared to 20-30 years ago.,Logistics issues  Raw material supply down  The cars themselves are changing very quickly and nothing the auto parts makers are making for the next generation is yet being produced at scale.   TL;DR: it‚Äôs a sector going through a transition.
investing,Oct,1fzveu8,How do you factor Traditional vs Roth into retirement calculations?,[deleted],Why would you be taxed 30%?  If all you have is a million and are following the 40% rule the first year you would take out $40k. That effective tax rate would only be around 11%.,You would account for taxes on what you withdraw each year.,"The 4% is the withdrawal rate from the account. That analysis doesn't care what happens to the money after it leaves, but only that withdrawal's effect on the viability of the portfolio.  I would separate that from what you do with the money after it is withdrawn.","&gt;Why would you be taxed 30%?  Because people seem fundamentally opposed to learning how their taxes work.  You get to feel righteous indigation if you convince yourself tHe GuBmInT is gonna take 30-50% of your paycheck, but you'd lose that if you accept what your actual marginal rate is.",No. That's the entire point of the money being in a Roth,&gt;If your retirement plans mean taking out big chicks each year  Sounds like a fun retirement!,"Roth money also does not impact the effect of how much social security is taxed, so there is some marginal tax difference in there. If you have other pension dollars, investment income, etc. it is possible you still pay on the 85% of SS, but, overall marginal rate is reduced with the Roth distribution compared to traditional funds.   Likewise, if you are trying to fill your budget, you can take less Roth money to meet those needs as you don't need additional distributions in order to satisfy the tax impact, so, in theory, the dollars invested can last longer, assuming the balances are starting at the same point.   Everyone is going to say what about the tax effect on the pre-tax contributions to the account over the years, but if that is the case, in order to make up the difference on the tax impact, you should really be funding more pre-tax contributions over the years in order to have a higher dollar value so that the net distribution after tax is the same during retirement, meaning that if this is the case, the real impact in current terms is likely not significant. And if your goal is to fully fund an IRA in either instance, then I would take the roth and eat the tax today, especially if I am on the younger side. There are some judgement calls in there as to what those various pre and post retirement rates are, but in essence, if I want my net post retirement money to be $X, then I really need more after tax dollars at retirement to make it all last the same length of time. This is assuming a perfect world of course, and I think slightly different than most, but my real world preference is Roth funding to get at least an employer match and brokerage accounts, because I don't want to be handcuffed to 59-1/2 before I really get my money tax free, and the preferential tax treatment of capital gains and qualified dividends make sense to me in the long run, and for what I want to use funds for otherwise. Bet everyone has their own situation to think through what is best for them.","Your understanding is incomplete. Traditional means it lowered your income in the years you contributed. You benefitted from this. If you would have done Roth 401k it wouldn‚Äôt have reduced your taxable income. You have to account for the taxes you didn‚Äôt pay at the time (the benefit) vs the benefit of not paying taxes later (Roth). I get what you‚Äôre saying though. And you‚Äôre sort of right. That‚Äôs why planning for specific goals is so important. Most people have two things in retirement, pretax 401k and value of home (which is irrelevant since they plan to die in that house anyways). Planning makes all the difference. If your retirement plans mean taking out big chicks each year, Roth is better, if your plan is to take out little by little for bills, traditional is better. Then you factor in the tradeoff of the benefit of reducing taxable income. Basically, you can‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre using the right tool unless you clearly define the ‚Äújob‚Äù. You might be using a hand shovel to build a swimming pool, for example.","The nice thing about traditional is that you control which tax bracket you‚Äôre in. So if you‚Äôre solely reliant on your traditional account and you have no other savings, your likelihood of paying more in taxes is greater because you may need to withdrawal more year to year. On the other hand, if you have savings and a Roth, the opportunity to keep yourself in the 12%-22% is a very real possibility.","The gist is correct, yes - you will have a higher tax burden in retirement with Trad contributions.  However, you ain't paying anything near 30% if you're pulling 40k a year   The trade-off with Roth vs Trad is that you can effectively save more Trad money thanks to not paying the taxes while working.  If your tax rate doesn't change when you retire, they come out about equal -- you save more Trad money but owe taxes on it in retirement.  But usually, your tax rate drops in retirement - maybe you have a paid off home and your expenses drop, or you aren't having to save for retirement while in retirement, etc.  so usually Trad is advantageous.  Sometimes not, but usually that's because you're in a low tax bracket while working, or you expect some huge inheritance, or some other weird scenario."

investing,Oct,1g2q4vm,What to do with Rollover IRA,"My wife has a Fidelity Rollover IRA valued at about $4.6K. It's all in FDRXX, earning what looks like ~5%.   She has a target date 403(b), maxing out with employer match, Yada yada....  What do we do with this Rollover IRA? Is it possible to convert that to either a traditional or Roth and invest it in something like FXAIX? It just feels a little stagnant, but I'm also ignorant.",You don‚Äôt have to convert it to anything it probably already is a traditional IRA. Yes you can invest it into any fund you want.,"The Rollover IRA is not the problem. The FDRXX inside the Rollover IRA is the problem. Change from that money market fund to a diversified stock fund, or a good low cost target date fund.",Are you a bot?,"You can convert it to a Roth regardless. It'd be a taxable event though, so all you have to do is pay taxes on it.  It's advised to only do this if you can pay the associated taxes in cash; you should not dip into the Roth for said taxes.",[deleted],"Do you plan to add to it? Also, you should look into other Fidelity funds like Contrafund and Magellan that just FDRXX.","There are some potential reasons to convert or further roll it over into your employer 401k/403b (assuming it's all pretax money) if possible though. Primarily, having a traditional IRA sitting around makes it much more annoying to do backdoor roths if you want that option.   But yea, the primary options to consider:  1. Leave it as-is (rollover is just a title but it's effectively probably a traditional IRA), but change the investments to something more suitable.  2. Roll it over into your employer plan (depends on what your employer's plan allows) to consolidate accounts and allow for backdoor roths. 3. Convert it all (or portions of it) into a Roth IRA. This would mean paying ordinary income tax on any amount that you convert, but if you think you are in a low-tax situation relative to where you might be in the future it may be worth it.","Depends on what the plan has setup, most times you can let it sit there if the amount is high enough like $10k.   Generally you have a few options:    * If you like the 401k and it's above their required amount, generally you can keep it there.   * You can roll it into the new place's 401k/Retirement plan, this cuts back on administration fees, and is easier to keep track of.   * You can roll it into a Traditional IRA. This can give you more control over where your money is invested, and gives you more options for what you want to buy e.g. if you like Vanguard Funds, you could buy them. You could also buy stocks, bonds, etc directly if you don't want to do funds.",Consider investing in stocks or bonds.,No. They'd be paying those taxes at the time of conversion. All you're doing is choosing to pay the taxes now instead of deferring it for later.

investing,Oct,1g09gyg,Starting an HSA in your 40s...,"Very late to the game in terms of investing, but in particular, just got hired for a new job, where my employer offers an HSA with a $1000 contribution, per year.   I am 43, and I am in good health. Typically, I just go for a PPO / POS low deductible health plan, because I have one kid, and my insurance supports my entire family (Me, my wife, and our son). But we do not typically spend a ton of money on healthcare.   Granted, that may change, but I live in a MCOL area, make around 200k, and feel I could pay out of pocket for anything that comes up, at least for now. Question is this:  * At this age, am I better off sticking with my current PPO/POS plan, or should I opt for a HDHP and participate in this HSA?  * For context:    * A PPO/POS plan would be about 400 bucks (out of my paycheck) per pay period for me and my family, with a $650 deductible for myself, and a $1000 for the family. With a MAX OUT of $2000.    * The HDHP would be about $250 per pay period, and a $3500 deductible / $6k Family, with a MAX OUT of about $8k.   The HSA investment options are good (OptumBank), and I know there are tremendous investment / tax-savings benefits here. I'll have a 401(k) with this new employer, and my previous 401k (now IRA) and Brokerage accounts total around 300k. Just want to make certain this isn't too late in life to reap the benefits, assuming we don't face any huge health issues over the next few years. Plus, I could always change enrollment options next year. But I just am not sure how long I will be at this company. Maybe 2-3 years for now.   Just curious if anyone else has done something similar. Thanks!","HSA has an advantage that no other accounts have, which is no FICA taxes on the contributions. That's an immediate 7.65% gain","I'm no expert, but this is my opinion...  \*Assuming you have 26 pay periods per year, your low deductible plan will cost you $10,400 in premiums and won't begin providing benefits until at least an additional $650 is spent on medical costs for a total of $11,050. The high deductible plan will cost $6,500 in premiums and won't provide benefits until you pay at least $3,500 of medical expenses for a total of $11,000. Of course, this is assuming the deductible for only you. If you someone else in your family is the main source of medical bills, then you'd have to rerun the numbers and it would vary some. Typically you're predicting one of two things. Either you predict that you won't spend much on medical expenses, in which case you actually save money going with the high deductible plan or you anticipate getting close to meeting your out of pocket max, in which case it seems your low deductible plan would be the most cost effective. The worst case scenario is paying a total of $12,400 for the year with the low deductible plan and $14,500 with the high deductible plan. The best case scenario is paying $10,400 for the low deductible plan and $6,500 for the high deductible plan. Some people like playing it safe and spreading the cost over time, so they go with the low deductible plan, but other people are willing to take the chance to potentially save a few thousand dollars if there aren't many medical needs throughout the year and take the cheaper high deductible plan. That's up to you and your family's situation or what makes you the most comfortable.  \*The benefit of an HSA is that it has triple tax benefits, so it isn't taxed when you contribute, gains aren't taxed, and it isn't taxed when you use it. From what I've seen, a lot of people use this as an additional retirement account as it has the best tax benefits of any account offered. They contribute the max amount allowed per year, invest it, and don't use it for reimbursement until retirement. I also believe that if you don't use the funds by a certain age (I think either 67 or 72), it can start being used for ordinary expenses, but I can't remember the details on that. Obviously, laws can change around these things also.   \*You do not have to use the HSA funds immediately and instead can pay medical expenses with a regular form of payment. If you do this and keep the medical receipt, you can choose, at any point in the future, to get reimbursement from your HSA. For example, you have a medical bill for $3,000 in 2025 and pay with your debit card. Save the receipt and keep any HSA funds invested and growing. In 2035 maybe you are looking to make a large purchase. You could, in 2035, use that receipt from 2025 and get reimbursed the $3,000 from your HSA. The benefit of this is that you have been able to grow that money for an additional 10 years tax free.   The main point with HSAs are that they are the best tax opportunity account offered. I don't recall all of the aspects of it, but listed the main ones that resonated with me. Hopefully that is useful!",Plus it's not taxed by the state so it's more than that even.,I started with an HSA for two years.

FZROX is basically 75% FXAIX + 25% small/med caps, so it's really just like buying more FXAIX. If your goal was to add more diversification, just know it's not really doing that because the differing factor is a small fraction of an already small holding in your portfolio.  I personally prefer total stock market funds like VZROX and VTI myself due to the small % of small/med caps and buy it over funds like FXAIX. It generally keeps things simpler to avoid too much overlap - for example, if you want to add more exposure to small/med caps it's best to buy some small/med cap ETFs directly so you can easily determine what % of your portfolio is exposed to that","the dividends from each rund can be automatically reinvested in the fund.

I believe that all the negative news has already been factored into the stock price, which has dropped 7% over the past three months. However, it has risen about 10% from its 52-week low. The stock offers a dividend yield of approximately 6% and has a forward P/E ratio of 11.

I personally see Paxlovid it from a different perspective: many assumed its revenue were going to disappear and they proved to be pretty resilient. Even in a world where covid is no big deal, Paxlovid sales continue.","God damn, man. Will this question ever go away?  The stock price is a complicated thing and more heavily influenced by pre-earnings action than you'd think. You will not really be able to predict the direction with any certainty. There are always different types of traders holding any particular stock. There are long-term holders who won't sell 'cause they believe in the company's long-term potential. There are those who do not believe in the long-term potential, there are scalpers just looking to make a quick profit with a predefined exit... there are those who buy puts hoping the price drops, those who buy calls hoping the price rises and so on. There are pump-and-dumpers and clueless clowns like you and me. There is a delicate interplay between these groups and whoever picks up momentum first can cause the price to move in directions opposite to that expected with simple models. It's a chaotic system wherein the actions of each individual trader can affect the direction the price moves.  To simplify this, though... when there are more people looking to sell than there are those looking to buy, the price will go down. Sometimes those are the scalpers, the pump-and-dumpers, or just the guy down the street two months behind on his mortgage payment. Who fucking knows? If there is a higher buying pressure than there is selling, the price will rise.   If either of these gets out of balance too much, the price will swing rapidly. Perhaps there is a lot of purchasing interest so the price begins to rise. As the price rises, this can entice others looking to cash out to sell. If that group is large enough, the price will stabilize and perhaps start to drop. If that drop velocity is fast enough, maybe a bunch more people panic and begin to sell thinking they're going to lose all of their profits thereby exasperating the price collapse. But then maybe there are enough waiting on the sidelines who see the price bottoming out below the 20-day moving average and that stimulates them into buying. Price begins to stabilize. Back and forth until stability is found.  Time of day matters, acceleration matters, level of surprise matters (CRUSHING earnings versus just beating), and so on. The point is that this is a multivariate, chaotic system that no one will ever be able to predict. Simplistic ""beat earnings, number go up"" models are insufficient. Sometimes people get lucky and the chaotic system moves according to the simple model, but that doesn't mean the simple model is accurate.  ""All models are wrong. Some models are useful. Your model is highly regarded."" - George Box",this person is some kinda ai bot or something,"Isn't Paxlovid somewhat essential to successfull early Covid treatment for older people?

investing,Oct,1fvrr36,At what point do you feel comfortable rewarding yourself?,"This may be more of a philosophical rant/question, but here goes.  Some brief background, I‚Äôm 34, my wife is 30 and we just had our first child a month ago. I consider myself a late bloomer in finances and career paths. I was lost in my early 20‚Äôs and had many obstacles trying to figure out a career. Never had a decent job to ever start really investing, I barely made enough to get by. Eventually I was able to get on a track and graduated with a professional degree in the medical field 3 years ago and finally have a decent job making decent income. My wife also graduated 3 years ago with her medical degree as well.   We live in Southern California, I bought our condo 3 years ago and fortunate to have a sub 3% loan. We‚Äôve saved enough to start shopping for our next home in the next few months and planning to rent out our current place out which should cash flow ~$500 a month. We‚Äôve both played some catch up in 401k/403b‚Äôs and our Roths, but admittedly it‚Äôs not a lot in a relatively short amount of time; especially considering we bought our current place and saving for the next as our main priorities. My current job might be my longterm career as it offers a state pension as well. 8% of each paycheck goes towards the pension.  I consider ourselves blessed and very proud of what we‚Äôve accomplished so far. But I‚Äôm having this internal dilemma over the last few months with setting selfish goals for the future. We all have a vices and hobbies, mine happens to be cars. My goal has always been to save towards a cool (but expensive) car in the next 1-2 years. It‚Äôs the one hobby that has stuck with me since I was a toddler, and I‚Äôm as passionate as ever about em.  However, as more time goes on and the more I save towards that goal, I‚Äôm feeling more anxiety and immense guilt with the thought of pulling the trigger in the future. Part of me feels that money should go towards some brokerage accounts to make up for lost time, or even possibly another piece of real estate (would obviously need to do extensive research to see what would be cash flow positive to make sense). And then the other part of me wants to enjoy life while it‚Äôs here.   So I guess my grand dilemma/question for you all is: at what point did you feel comfortable (if at all) to spoil yourself? I understand for most people it means reaching a certain number, but I‚Äôm curious to see some other philosophies.   Thanks y‚Äôall","You feel guilty because you know it's not right. Splurging on a car is fine if the amount is no big deal, but if you have to debate between the car or goals for your family, then may be you want too much.  Judging by your post history, you probably want something in the $100k to $200k range right? Personally, the only time I would throw that much on a car is if i'm worth so much where $200k is to me what a new fancy power tool is to the average middle class person. It's slightly expensive but doesn't affect my financial situation at all.","Reading your other posts, if you can afford a $100k car, and maintaining it, and you don't think that you can retire before 50, then that means you actually can't afford the car or something is not right with your retirement planning.  My counter to the ""enjoy life because it's short"" mentality that you've adopted is that working for 30 to 40 years isn't really the kind of enjoying that one should strive for. If life is short then why would you want to spend all that time working? I live a frugal life. I managed to save and retire before turning 40. No one can say that I wasted my life and didn't enjoy it, I'm enjoying it right now by not having to ever work again. I enjoy cars too, I have two Miatas that I work on myself but they are both old cars from 1990s. They are withing my budget after focusing on early retirement. Retiring early is just as much a luxury as a fancy car, you just have to decide which you want more.",Spending that kind of money on a car just seems so pointless. It‚Äôs one of those things that seems like it‚Äôs cool for a few weeks then it just becomes your normal car and you‚Äôre used to it.,"FWIW, my neighbor did this with a boat. His lifelong dream was to buy a boat.  His then-fiancee convinced him to rent one for the day.  He did, loved it, and was even more set on buying a boat.  She told him to plan their next boat outing.  It was a great time on the water, but it was nearly 3 months later.  He realized dropping a few hundred on a weekend for a boat day was much better than buying, maintaining, winterizing, and mostly watching it sit in the slip (or driveway)","Let me share my very supportive wife‚Äôs advice, when I was faced with the same question, although on a smaller scale ( for me it would have been an expensive bike).  Rent the car for a weekend. The best one you can. Enjoy it, return it, then immediately start to plan the next weekend with a different one.  You will find that between working and family stuff, there is so little time left for hobbies (especially with a newborn) that sometimes there will be months between opportunities. I found renting very satisfying because I get to try and live with multiple 20 grand plus bikes ( mainly Harleys) and still pay less for it than what I would pay for on a single bike in taxes.  Give it a thought, best of luck.","I think that I have some expensive hobbies and I don't spend more than ~$5k a year on them. A car is several orders of magnitude higher than that in cost. Think of this basically as your entertainment/hobby budget. How much would you have to make to be willing to drop $10k+ annually (or whatever you estimate the extra amortization+insurance+maintenance this car would cost) on a hobby?  Also note that for stuff like cars, the earlier you buy them the worse it is. If you drop $100k on a car that will cost you $300k+ in forgone growth over 20 years. But if you drop $100k on a car in 20 years that will only cost you $100k then. Expensive hobbies are much easier to justify when you aren't looking at paying decades worth of compound growth on top of the cost.","If you get buyer‚Äôs remorse, just sell it. The diff in what you bought it for vs what it sells for is the true sunk cost, not the full ticket price. If that‚Äôs something you can swallow for taking a stab at your dream and seeing how it feels, then pull the trigger.","You're being down voted because you're in a financial/investing subreddit asking for advice and people are telling you, from a financial/investment perspective, spending 100k+ on a car is idiotic.  If you want to regard it as a hobby or treating yourself or whatever then it is your money and you do you. But if you ask on an investing/personal finance subreddit 'Yo should I spend 100k on a new car?' then of course everyone is going to tell you fuck no you shouldn't.",Flip side of your argument: why save up all this money for old age if you can‚Äôt enjoy any of it in old age? There‚Äôs a lot of things that I want to experience in life that I know age will become a barrier to. Not sure how applicable this is for OP with his car but it‚Äôs a very real consideration one must make.,"&gt;working for 30 to 40 years isn't really the kind of enjoying that one should strive for  I think the answer to everything on this thread is ""it depends"", I know people who really did ""make their hobby into a job, then you don't ever work"", but it's not easy at all to get there. And others who lumbered along, semi-engaged with their jobs but fairly content, the money was coming in, the pension was being accummulated, PTO was guaranteed, all good under the sun!  I don't know if jobs nowadays are far more stressful than they were before. I want to say yes but could be biased. Old Economy Steve will tell us that in the past (say 70s-2000s) one could have a regular, somewhat easygoing middle class job and live a fairly comfortable life. Don't know, it looked like this from the outside when I look at my parents, while my kids will probably remember their dad as someone who worked long hours and was stressed a lot.   &gt;I have two Miatas that I work on myself but they are both old cars from 1990s.  Miatas, or MX5 as I know them, are fun cars, great to drive and the second generation looks very elegant to me, but I think OP wants far more performance."
investing,Oct,1gfkvdo,By how much do interest rates have to go down to recover my 3% loss in bonds in the last few months?,"I dutifully moved some cash to BND and a ""special"" bond fund in my 401k prior to the Fed's recently-announced rate decrease, expecting bond values to increase as a result. Instead, both bond funds went DOWN in value, substantially in the latter case (down over 3% in this short period of time). When can I expect to recuperate this loss in value and see a net gain in bond pricing due to reduced rates?","&gt;I dutifully moved some cash to BND and a ""special"" bond fund in my 401k prior to the Fed's recently-announced rate decrease, expecting bond values to increase as a result.  So here's a more comprehensive lesson for you.   Look at this chart: https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/    The fed moves the short rate up and down, that's the one all the way at the left.  Everything from the 1M and on is priced more or less based not on what the Fed does today, but what we expect them to do tomorrow (plus or minus some premium over time the longer out on the curve you get).    Your bond fund sits with a duration around 6.  That's a far cry from the 0 duration rate the Fed is grappling up and down.  The reason why bonds have taken a small hit recently is because our expectations for Fed rate cuts over the next few years have shifted slighly up.  This doesn't mean the Fed will be raising rates, it means the pace of lowering them is slightly slower than we thought it might be three months ago.  This makes the present value of a bond fall because the expectation of the average rate across those next few years has gone up.    Trying to time the bond market in the very short run is very difficult.  You can occasionally make some good directional bets like ""the long end of the curve is too low"" but rarely will that play out in a three month cycle.","Look at the average duration of your fund, then you can compute how much rates will have to reduce. Duration in years multiplied by the interest rate difference gives you an estimate of the price increase/decrease.   Example 1: if the duration is 1 year, rates would have to drop ~3% for the value of your fund to increase by 3%   Example 2: if the duration is 10 years, rates would have to drop ~0.3% to get the value up by 3%.","Yeah, but that's also related to it's comparable spot on the curve, not the short rate.  OP's mistake was that he was looking at the short rate and thinking it would move his portfolio with a duration of 6.","It's as simple as just take that same point in the curve, and add the premium for risk.  Higher risk bonds will have a shorter duration due to the yield obvs tho.",^^ this or just hold the bonds until maturity.,Well I hope you didn‚Äôt purchase them to fund a near term consumption need. Otherwise if you hold them until maturity they will fulfill their intended purpose assuming those companies don‚Äôt default on their debts.,"I'm holding a large portion in BND, and have been DCA/DRIP for the past year or so. Its price fluctuations are, in my opinion, less material than their payout currently.  Bonds have a duration, and so the price will not change immediately with the day to day interest rate changes. They will over time adjust as bonds expire and new bonds at a current rate are introduced. It's a fund of bonds, not an actual bond, so the fluctuations are less predictable.","Trying to time bond markets is generally no easier than trying to time equity markets (which is to say, you typically shouldn't be trying to). The longer-term rates that are driving down the value of BND are broadly determined by the market (not by the fed). Economic numbers have been coming in strong (good news!) but the market has been expressing concerns around inflationary policies post-election, combined with some structural dynamics w/ larger bond and note sales that treasury has held in recent days.",The share price of a Bond ETF doesn't matter at all.  You should be holding it for decades.  All of the returns you see from it will be monthly distributions paid back to you over a long period of time.  Being worried about a 3% share price loss over 3 months is absurd.,"The spread between treasuries and corporate bonds are heavily influenced by the expectations of the economic future by investors.  Yields of corporate bonds increase to offset perceived risk.  Today the spread is pretty small between treasuries and investment grade corporate bonds, because investors by and large are optimistic about the economic future and don't see tons of risks in corporate defaults.    This makes sense if you put yourself in the shoes of a bond investor choosing between a guaranteed yield of say, 4% in a treasury bond, vs let's say 5% in an investment grade corporate bond.  You're expecting a higher yield in the corporate to offset some amount of risk that the business goes belly up and defaults on your bond.  If you saw that risk as higher, you'd expect a higher yield, say, 6% or more even.  That's why ""junk"" bonds have higher yields."

After reading some posts on here I opted to put 80% into VOO, 15% into VXUS, and 5% into BND and just try to keep buying that for the next 40 years of our lives. Is this an okay setup? Want to make the best decision for our future","This is perfect. For the love of god, please resist the urge to fiddle with it. You can either spend the next 40 years stressing out about if you've got your maximizing your returns, or you can take comfort in the peace of mind that what you're doing have now will provide you with more than enough when it comes time to use it.","Couple things I would do.   1. I would change VOO to VTI so I can cover the full US market.  2. I would increase VXUS a little more between 20%-30%.  3. I would not use bonds at all in a Roth IRA. You want the most growth since it‚Äôs tax free, and you have almost 40 years before you will use this money. I would only use bonds in a Traditional 401k or Traditional IRA.","Very good setup, as you get closer to retirement might want to increase allocation to BND but that‚Äôs a long ways off","Get out of bonds. At age 23 you should be 100% equities. In the long run equities will destroy bonds returns. And since you are 40+ years away from retirement there is zero reason for bonds for many decades.   Bonds may seem safer. But they are not. Risk free bonds (US treasury bills) barely beat inflation over the long run. That means your investments will get eaten up by inflation. Equities on the other hand destroy inflation over the long run.  Even when you are close to retirement or retired you hardly need bonds. If you have other sources of income like social security or brokerage accounts. Or if your retirement accounts generate dividends. It is possible to pay all your bills with hardly touching your retirement accounts besides withdrawing dividends.   Keep in mind if you retire at 65 you could live another 30 years. You don‚Äôt want to heavily invested in bonds that barely beat inflation.   Even if you are forced to sell some stock during a dip, you still are better off because of 30-60 years of growth in stocks.  In the past bonds were more viable. Because interest rates were higher. You could easily get bonds (low risk) that return 6-7%. But those days seem over. Bonds are paying a little over 4%. This barely beats inflation and in many cases losses to inflation.

Love to the idea of set and forget, open to Any suggestions","That‚Äôs a tough question to answer, but I think around 10yrs til retirement you‚Äôd want to start working you way up to at least 20-40% BND.¬†  The general thinking is when approaching retirement you want to have a more stable balance that you can draw upon. Market cycles typically go in an 8yr pattern so you don‚Äôt want to be caught having to withdraw funds at the bottom of a cycle when prices are lowest. BND keeps the balance more stable during the drawdown","To be 100% clear... If this is your only retirement account, the Band allocation is fine, and desirable from a diversification standpoint. If you have other accounts, the tax efficient changes.  Not that I want to write about taxable investment accounts at this time of night but...  A Roth is an account which is taxed going into the account. A traditional 401k is taxed as it goes out. OP's point is that if you have a low returning asset in an account that is tax-free at withdrawal, it doesn't benefit you very much (as you typically have a higher marginal tax rate in high earning years than in retirement). So you pay your current tax rate now, then get a bit more from appreciation later. If you put that allocation in a trad 401k, you don't get taxed now, it compounds, then you have a tax rate when you withdraw it at retirement. In theory.  In essence, the point is to take ALL of your accounts into account, and how they are taxed. You want your total wealth to be diversified, in the most tax advantageous way you can.  If this is your only account, don't worry about BND. It is a good thing to have (rebalancing premium) and isn't enough to be a huge hindrance.if you have other accounts, think about how you can optimize your after tax return.",At 23 you don‚Äôt need bonds in a Roth. Take that 5% and put it to VXUS. That would be a long term winning portfolio. You don‚Äôt need bonds until 30 at the earliest and 40 at the latest.

I-Bonds aren't taxed at the state level like a HYSA might be. Also, I-Bonds are even less riskier than a HYSA because even FDIC banks can fail which could cause a temporary headache, whereas, if the USFG collapses, then we all have bigger concerns than our investments.","This is wrong.

So, I've been on the fence about dropping into a index fund, which seems easy enough to withdraw from, if I actually have an emergency.  Thoughts?",What type of savings account?  You can put it in something like Wealthfront Cash Account and earn 4.5% on that money right now (was 5% until interest rates dropped recently),"While I've had the same thoughts myself, your emergency fund should be in something liquid and guaranteed.   One of the most common ways an ""emergency"" would hit is the economy cycles and the market drops 30% for 4 or 5 years and unemployment jumps for a couple of years meaning you could be without a job for a few months while the market is down 30%. Now you're looking for a job while depleting your 18k emergency fund that was 27k 2 months ago.   Your emergency fund isn't meant to beat inflation or grow at a large clip. Yes you lose some upside there but that's okay for an emergency fund.

What you can do is make sure it's in a high yield savings account so it will keep up as much as it can with no risk attached. You could very well be close to inflation over the last few years with something like that but generally you aren't going to beat inflation that way.","Why would a HYSA be problematic? I know some (though not all) have limits on the number of withdrawals per month, but couldn't you just make one big withdrawal if you needed to?","Depends on your net worth.  In reality it should be 6 months of expenses if You are the sole earner,  3 months of you are married and you both work","I would put it into a Fidelity brokerage which earns roughly 4.7% (haven't checked for a while) by default, as you then have the capacity to dump it into ETFs or stocks as well. It's completely liquid and is treated like cash. And using an ATM ANYWHERE has all ATM fees refunded.","Your emergency fund should be an emergency fund. Putting it into a money market fund like VMFXX is a way to save it that makes it easily accessible, and as of this year, actually is better than inflation.   However, I felt a similar way about my account so I split the difference and kept half in a money market fund and half in a brokerage. The way I thought about it is - what do I need for 1 month if I lost my job? What would I need for 2 months? What would I need for 3 months? Etc.   Since my spouse also works and both of us can support the entire household if one of us loses our job, I felt safe going a little more risky.","I had similar thoughts over 10 years ago once my savings exceeded 6 months of expenses. I put the entire amount in a brokerage account and invested in a S&amp;P 500 index ETF for several years until it grew to over a year of expenses. Then I started investing it aggressively and it now amounts to over 5 years of expenses. The balance serves as my emergency fund but also will help if/when I retire before age 59 1/2 (so I can avoid penalties on early withdrawals from my retirement accounts). One downside is my taxes are higher but higher taxes are just an indicator of success. I would much rather pay higher taxes than have a smaller balance earning less than 6%. I suggest starting conservative but getting more aggressive as your wealth, knowledge, and experience grow.","The problem with putting your savings into an index fund is that it will go down in value during a depression, and the time when you are most likely to need your savings is a depression.   A CD might fit your needs. It has a better rate of return than a savings account, but unlike an index fund it cannot go down in value and worst-case you lose the interest by withdrawing early. It isn't sexy, but neither is a savings account.",I'm glad I invested my emergency fund over a decade ago. You might be too.,It should be based on your expenses and your risk appetite.   I'm conservative when it comes to risk so we keep about 8 months of expenses in a mix of a high yield savings and a CD ladder and our checking account.   Some people do 6 months.   Some do 3 months. 3 is about the minimum to be considered a fully funded emergency fund though.   Early in your career this will be a higher percentage of net worth than later of course but since OP mentioned having a healthy 401k and all i assume the percentage is pretty low so the opportunity cost doesn't really move the needle.

I wanted the equities to be non-tech stocks as I think they're horribly over inflated - their PE ratios are scary as snot.  Reallocating to mostly bonds just feels WRONG - like I'm leaving a ton of money on the table. However we have 'enough' now and the main danger is losing it and destroying my (somewhat early) retirement plans.  I'm 57 and we're 3 years out from retirement when I hit 61. As I type almost everything is in a $680k 401k and about 10 grand is in a ""slush fund"" savings account. We'll be living on our investments until I claim social security @ 63. We're buffered a LOT by my military retirement &amp; VA of $4300/month that I currently receive, and the $1100 my wife gets from Social Security Disability.   I'll be converting all the assets to a Roth after retirement spread out over several years to keep it under the 12/15% tax bracket to keep taxes from eating us alive in our 70s.

Buy bonds. That way even if interest rates move you get guaranteed interest rate and your principle is 100% safe. Go with T bills,"They lose principal if rates go up. However, if you're holding individual bonds and the rates go up, you can either (1) sell the bond to get a better one, in which case you also lose principal, or (2) keep your lower-paying bond, and miss out on the higher interest rates. Either way, the money is the same in the end.","If you are buying individual bonds, you are vastly increasing your default risk. Buying a large portfolio of bonds to reduce credit risk is very expensive.",The problem with bond funds is that you are buying into an open ended portfolio.  You have both principal risk and interest rate risk.   If you have a fixed cash flow requirement buying individual fixed income securities you can eliminate much of that risk.   You will give up some return for eliminating the risk.  In a rate easing cycle you want to lock in to rates which you will not achieve with bond fund and a rolling portfolio.,Bond funds are better because they are diversified. And individual bonds can technically lose principal if you have to sell them early.,I think you are not taking on enough equity risk given your rather robust retirement benefit assets.,Just buy T bills. Basically risk free. The OP is willing to give up some returns for a guaranteed income. Buying T bills of various lengths is the answer for guaranteed income with zero risk of losing principle.   Any bond funds can lose principle. It is stated on the prospectus,You have a bond-like portfolio already due to the VA / SS benefits. Why be even safer than that? You can model the income you receive from these as an interest payment from a bond and use that to inform your allocation.

And the reason is because your other benefits that kick in at age 63 will be sufficient to cover most of your expenses?  I ask because I early-retired 8 years ago starting with a 65% stake in bonds, but that extreme was necessary to bring volatility down‚Äîbecause we spend the portfolio down about 3% annually for all our living expenses.  If you anticipate spending down just a small fraction of your pie for living expenses, then in your shoes I'd still aim for growth, yet guard against possibly unrecoverable huge drawdowns by using an asset like Treasurys that rallys when stocks tank. For example a 15% stake in longish-term Treasurys will balloon into a 20% to 23% stake in a big stock selloff. It's difficult to find Treasury maturities from 10 to 30 years in a single ETF,   In a selloff you're already in a better position than people with 100% stock portfolios. In this example you'd only have an 85% exposure to stocks. Then for a bonus, you can sell off however much of the bond position you want in order to buy more stocks at depressed prices. And because of this, when stocks recover, you'll reach break-even quicker than someone with a 100% stock portfolio.  Knowing what percentage you think you'll be taking out of the portfolio each year for living expenses will inform you on how to adjust your portfolio's risk.",Make sure you understand the bond fund's holdings and how they generate their revenue.  actually with any fund.  but bond funds actually went broke during the 2008 credit crisis.

I don‚Äôt want my money to sit around and not grow, but also don‚Äôt want to risk losing it.",How about to start you just open a Vanguard account and drop it ALL in an S&amp;P 500 index fund?

Congrats!  1.) The first thing you need to do if you don't already have one is open a high yield savings account - there are tons of them laying around - SoFi, Ally, Capital One, Discover, etc they'll be internet banks - that way your 85k you've saved up with actually do \*something\*. Get your money in there.   2.)If you haven't already set aside 6 months of living expenses out of that total and that'll be your ""emergency fund"" that you simply leave in cash forever - make sure to get a debit card/checks for your savings account so you can use it quickly.   3.) Open yourself an IRA with a brokerage of your choice - Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard are all great choices. If you earn a fairly high income (I'd say somewhere over 80k per year) a traditional IRA may be of some benefit, but generally speaking, a ROTH is the better option for a younger person. That just means you'll use your savings money or paychecks to go into this ROTH, and you've paid taxes on it already through payroll, so you're good to go and wont have to pay taxes on it again. The trick here is you're only allowed to put 7k in per year, and once it's there you can \*only\* withdraw your contributions without paying a penalty with some exceptions (for example you can withdraw up to 10k to buy your first home).   4.) So, guesstimating here, but you'll have something like 10-12k for your ""emergency fund"" which you only use for emergencies, and you'll be able to sock away 14k into your Roth IRA. That leaves you with about 59 grand to play with. I assume you're probably on your parent's healthcare plan. If you're in a high deductible plan you could contribute the maximum to an HSA for this year and next (this may not be possible if they're claiming you as a dependent on their taxes or are maxing a family contribution). If your coverage provides you the option of making an HSA that's another 4,150k you can sock away in a tax protected account.   5.) After that, I would open a taxable brokerage account for your remainder.   I'd do the following: Generally speaking, if you don't know and don't want to learn what to do with investing, you're better of buying index etfs with very low fees. This guarantees you ""average"" performance for the index. Many people will tell you this is the ""least risky"" option - that isn't true at all - you are directly assuming the risk of the index, \*but\* your performance is guaranteed to be average. So let's assume you have 55k to play with here.   I would A.) Leave 7k uninvested in a money market fund (which is what your money automatically does most of the time when you put it in an account - or your broker will hassle you and make you buy it) that'll go into your IRA next year, and if possible another 4.125k uninvested for an HSA. Then most people would suggest something like VOO which is the S&amp;P 500 - which averages inflation adjusted returns of about 7% per year, or VTI (which is just the whole US stock market) which returns somewhat similarly. Most people would probably have you just use everything you don't need right now and buy into that straight off 100%. I would add international exposure right now because American stocks are historically expensive right now so you may as well get in on emerging markets like EEM.  Now over time, you can leave this money alone, but should you ever need it you will need to sell your index funds and move them - that is a taxable event, and you will pay more taxes if you have gains within the first year. You actually get a tax benefit if you lose money lol. Then you basically do the same thing in your IRA and forget that you've done it - an old legend is that Fidelity looked up their top performing retail accounts to scout for talent and found that the majority of them were people who had A.) Died or B.) forgot they opened the account. Just don't touch it unless you need the money for something very specific.",Put it in a high yield savings until you figure it out. Fidelity gives near 5% between trades.,"Don't drop it all in. Set aside 6-month emergency fund first. If you have a goal to move out by a certain year, open a HYSA and keep the money to do it there.

Ideally we'd like to sell it and either invest or put it towards a bigger down payment on our second home. Already put earnest money down for second home.

(14 karats out of a possible 24 karats for pure gold).  If your piece is 100 grams total, you have 58.33 grams of pure gold.  Look up the spot price of gold when selling, 58.33 x whatever spot price is, and that is the MINIMUM you should look to sell it for.  Minimum.  This is of course assuming it‚Äôs a nice piece of jewelry.  The store may try to talk you down from there, citing smelting and refining cost, but if it‚Äôs a nice piece they‚Äôre not likely to smelt it.  And of they are, that‚Äôs not your choice or problem and a sign you need to go somewhere else.    Also keep in mind this is JUST the gold; often that\~42% can be silver or other precious metal.  Not necessarily, might be copper.  I wouldn‚Äôt know.  But point is, don‚Äôt take less than the melt value of the gold by itself, and consider that the absolute floor for a serviceable piece of finished jewelry.  Start much higher in the negotiations, and do not go lower.","Great advice on weighing and calculating gold value, It‚Äôs essential to know your worth before selling. Have you had experience negotiating for jewelry before?","I helped my mom sell a couple things a number of years ago and the first place was ridiculously low, well below melt.  (at that point in my life i collected coins so I knew what gold was going for so I knew it ridiculous on its face).  What‚Äôs more this was nice jewelry, nicer than they had on display.  So it was obvious they were going to polish it up and sell it for a premium.  So my BS detector was off the charts when the guy started teling me about the cost to smelt it down and re-purify it.  We ended up leaving there, going somewhere else and getting a bit above the melt value somewhere else.  It was a couple hundred dollars I think, but this was years ago so I don‚Äôt remember.    Here‚Äôs the thing though: whoever you sell it to, they have to male their money somewhere.  Even if they have exact same ring as in their showcase, they will not offer to buy yours for the same price they have listed for theirs.  They can‚Äôt.  What‚Äôs more, if they buy it from you they may sit on it for 6 months before it sells.  And time is money.   So they‚Äôll never give you what it‚Äôs truly ‚Äòworth‚Äô ever.

It might not be worth what you think unless it's a considerable amount.   You can treat solid gold like you would cash saved in a bank account. It's just an inflation proofed store of wealth. If the jewelry has no sentimental value then I'd just sell it off too. As for selling it, that's as simple as googling for gold buyers in your area and calling around to find who is closest to spot price. Read reviews, see who pulls bait and switches on their pricing.

And ask them to tell you what it is. They have a machine, the good ones that is, that'll tell you it's whatever percentage gold and whatever percentage of other stuff and they can give you a guideline value.    Pawn shops quote about 20 to 25% discount of spot. That's their traditional market unless you come in with a lot then they may go down to 7 or 8%.    Your next step is to go to a jeweler that is within your cultural reference, and have them give you a quote. Because how the gold is shaped and the jewels that are laid in there may have a significant value culturally.    I have a car in my backyard. I tell them that it's a 1968 Pontiac. And it's dirty. The guy will tell me it's worth 800 bucks. I call a Pontiac dealer and I told him I have a 68 Pontiac, and that it's dirty, he may tell me that it's worth $2,000 because he specializes in that field. I then go looking for somebody who owns a similar car 68 Pontiac, and ask them who is the top expert for 68 Pontiac, and employ that person to sell my car, because that person, came in with a bucket, wash the car, and discovered that it's true value was worth more than 50,000 because it was a 68 GTO Pontiac, and the dirt was hiding all the numbers.    Simply by going first to the pawn shop you get a baseline value, then you can go to any regular jewelry store and get a general better value.

Most of the rest of my expendable money after that went into SP500 index funds (FXAIX). That money has obviously performed much better than the CDs and I have a little bit of buyer's remorse. Does it make sense to keep these CDs? Should I wait until they mature and then put that money in with my SP500 indexes? What, if any, role do CDs play in a portfolio?","Their primary use is to lock-in money for known expenses in the short-to-medium-term. For instance, if you know you will make a large purchase in X months, you may want to lock-in money for that with an X-month CD to earn some return on it over just holding it in cash. You can also use a CD ladder in this way to replicate an emergency fund, where you can effectively prepay for X month's worth of expenses within your ladder to cover them if anything happens while locking in some amount of return.  I would not use them as an investment vehicle. They're basically a way to earn some small return on cash that you know you will need in some set amount of time.","Answered here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/z9udxz/comment/iyiqktf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/z9udxz/comment/iyiqktf/)   Like the commenter, I don't have any CDs.  I have my emergency fund in a money market, and I have my long term savings in VTSAX. If I'm saving up for a car or wedding or something in that range, I just put it in my money market to be taken out later.","You're plenty smart enough if you can use a computer, find your way here, and ask some good questions.  IMO, a financial advisor would be a waste of money at this point. The first few stages of financial investing are generally well understood and widely documented. Look up Financial Order of Operations. [Here's an example article explaining the Financial Order of Operations](https://moneyguy.com/article/foo/).  And there's no single path to follow. Learn and apply as you see fit.","Thank you! Your approach definitely sounds better than mine. My CDs aren't really earning any more interest than my money market, and the money market is more liquid. Thank you! I'm going to read through that post.","Note that MMFs returning the same/more than medium-term CDs is just a current phenomenon. I think in average economic conditions you should be able to earn a little bit more by holding cash in CDs, but of course at the cost of reduced liquidity.  But someone still working, something like a HYSA or MMF is generally better even if they are earning slightly less, as you are probably paying for day-to-day expenses out of your income so being able to pay for emergencies that require a sudden influx of cash is what that fund is most important for.  CDs are more commonly used in this fashion if you are retired or otherwise not working so you can prepay for a couple year's worth of predictable expenses without having to worry about market fluctuations.","Fixed income is almost like hide your cash under the mattress. When ready it pops back at you with a few chocolates coming out.  I have learned to lock in a high yield etf.  When you need the money, you cash it out with click and 24 hour delay.",That makes a lot of sense to me. My CDs are basically just sitting there like a savings account. I don't need that money. Sounds like maybe I should move that money once the CDs mature. I can use my money market fund for emergency funds if needed. Interest is about the same and it's more liquid. Thank you for your help!,"CDs pay state income tax, treasuries do not, so I‚Äôd look there if you want ladders. Or just buy a bond ETF.","A money market fund very well could be better for you, but just FYI it's rare for short term interest rates to exceed longer term interest rates.  When this is the case it's said that ""the yield curve is inverted"".  This occurs when interest rates are expected to fall because if there's no anticipated changes in interest rates you'd expect a higher return the longer you lock up your money for.",Thank you! I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm smart enough for all of this. Maybe I should just get a financial advisor üòÇ great info. I really appreciate it.

I'm also doing all this in my spare time alongside my normal job.   I'm looking for a YouTube channel, newsletter, online magazine, podcast or any other channel that classifies the market objectively and also likes to take a closer look at and analyze individual companies/stocks. Personally, I'm not so keen on flashy content and people with strong opinions trying to sell you something.

They give me a few different insights and i weigh them... but, mostly just for diversity. I don't want to listen to just one source for my information.  Finally, I'll share my approach: I know I can't look at all the companies so I look research a company after I'm convinced they are worth a look at. For instance, back when Netflix was the only streaming service and EVERYONE used it, I was a huge proponent of that stock. When we were promised ""affordable health care"" I made 3x my healthcare stocks in 5 years. I expect inflation to stay with us for a few more years so I moved my $$$ into utilities and consumer staples. Figure out where you think society is going and look at companies that thrive in that environment. This helps you narrow down the companies you are researching.

At times, I even thought about not contributing anymore as it felt I could use that money and get better things. Things like enjoy life. It took for ever to reach my first $100,000. Like I stated, I use to work for minimum wages and I am a late starter. I started contributing at 32 years old only because I was promoted to a job that matched 5% (I understood the free money concept). Investments were never a thing for my parents as they lived paycheck to paycheck. I was raised with the mentality that investing was only for rich people(wrong). Now, I am 48 years old and have moved to other jobs. For the last years, I have witnessed the power of compounding. I am so proud and happy I didn't stop contributing to my 401k when it seemed not to grow. Know, I fully agree with what is said about investing. Don't get disencouraged the first years as it feel it doesn't grow. My retirement portfolio is now $750,000 (aside from my house that has around $400,000 in equity). I should be able  payoff my house by age 56. My plan is to retire 12 years from now at 60 with $2,000,000. It feels possible. Regardless of where you come from, we all have a chance.

I've always picked my own investments, primarily an SP500 index fund and a few other index funds. They have performed exceedingly well and helped me get where I am. The advisory fee is 80 basis points (approximately $32,000/year) which seems insane to me. My spouse is somehow convinced that an advisor could avoid market downfalls by timing the market, even though they didn't mention it. Ideally, I'd like to find a fee only advisor who doesn't charge an arm an leg for ongoing 'management'.

investing,Nov,1h28t5b,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.  The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.  They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.  This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.  As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.  Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.  I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.     tl,dr; the energy it takes to train ChatGPT could fry 100,000 turkeys this year (I didn't check the math)","If NVIDIA is the main topic of the Thanksgiving diner, then I guess it is time to sell.","If Tesla has hardware ‚Äúyears ahead‚Äù of Nvidia, why has Elon spent $4 Billion on their GPU‚Äôs this year?

Elon is known for overworking and underpaying his employees. Who would sign up for that.,"I have been working in the ML space for close to a decade now.

CUDA essentially made it easy for tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch (the tools most commonly used for building and training models) to build on top of it. AMD just didn‚Äôt have the same level of flexibility and the ML libraries didn‚Äôt support them.   Back when v100s (enterprise grade NVIDIA GPUs) were new (2017) I helped buy a dozen or so. There wasn‚Äôt really an AMD enterprise equivalent that we could have bought if we wanted to.   AMD is just starting to catch up in terms of enterprise offerings. They finally have some enterprise grade GPUs. I now work for a compute platform company and we officially started supporting AMD GPUs this year. So far I am not aware of a single customer actually using them though but people are talking about them.   The other thing that helped things to blow up was LLMs, or more specifically transformers.  Prior to transformers, we generally saw diminishing returns in making models larger once we reached a certain point.  Before transformers a 10 million parameter model would have been considered quite large. The biggest baddest Llama model is 405 billion. It takes 32 top of the line h100 GPUs to run a single instance of the model in full precision. The number of training hours completely dwarfs that number though. It requires thousands of GPUs to train.  Right now NVIDIA is the only game in town. It may change soon but people choosing non NVIDIA GPUs are actively choosing something less powerful mostly for cost or availability reasons.","Heard it here first folks AI kills 100,000 turkeys this Thanksgiving.. it truely is evil and must be stopped"

Also by training myself to invest a significant portion of raises and promotions, I've set myself up that a job loss or change resulting in a part cut could theoretically be absorbed by just cutting back on my continued contributions. By maxing 401k and Roth, I essentially have almost a $30k annual buffer that could be absorbed without actually impacting my expenses.","Something about Buffet that is not mentioned is that yes he is smart and hardworking, but he was also born into a rich family.

investing,Nov,1gxd6lm,Nvidia's Jaw-Dropping Earnings Report: Can It Justify Its $3.5 Trillion Valuation?,"Nvidia just delivered another incredible earnings report:   ‚û°Ô∏è **$35.08 billion in revenue** (+94% YoY)   ‚û°Ô∏è **$19.31 billion in net income**   ‚û°Ô∏è **Data center revenue surged 112% YoY to $30.8 billion**  But despite these results, Nvidia‚Äôs stock has barely moved, even dipping 2.51% this morning. This raises a key question: **Can Nvidia justify its $3.5 trillion market cap?**  # Breaking It Down:  To support such a valuation, Nvidia would likely need to achieve **$175‚Äì$200 billion in annual net income** (assuming a P/E ratio of 20, standard for mature tech companies).  Right now, its theoretical annualized net income (based on Q3) is around **$77 billion**, meaning Nvidia would need to **more than double its profits** to justify its valuation.  # Why the Market Is Cautious:  As Howard Marks said: *‚ÄúTrees don‚Äôt grow to the sky, and few things go to zero.‚Äù* Nvidia‚Äôs growth has been extraordinary, but the reality is that sustaining this momentum is a monumental challenge.  Some have even compared the current **AI boom to the dot-com bubble**, but there‚Äôs one critical difference: **Earnings.**  * During the dot-com era, valuations were fueled by hype, often with little to no revenue. * Nvidia, on the other hand, is generating **real, record-breaking profits** driven by demand for its AI and data center solutions.  # Challenges Ahead:  1Ô∏è‚É£ **Valuation Pressure:** Can Nvidia keep up this growth to align with its high P/E ratio?   2Ô∏è‚É£ **Macro Risks:** Geopolitical tensions and rising interest rates could weigh on demand.   3Ô∏è‚É£ **AI‚Äôs Long-Term Curve:** Is this explosive growth sustainable, or will it normalize over time?  # Final Thoughts:  So, is Nvidia‚Äôs valuation a bet on the inevitability of AI, or are we starting to see cracks in the narrative? To justify its $3.5 trillion valuation, Nvidia must achieve **earnings growth that rivals the most transformative companies in history**.  What do you think? Is this the next era of sustained innovation, or is Nvidia‚Äôs valuation pricing in too much optimism?  *Disclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Please do your own research or consult with a professional before making investment decisions.*","I am a shareholder.   My thinking is this is a Boom and Bust industry, so at some point sales will decline. It could be due to the Big Tech reaching the capacity they need for the short-term. And/or Amazon/Google's chips are getting more popular because they are more cost efficient than Nvidia.   Jensen Hwang has been saying there is interest from other governments to build their own AI models and cloud infrastructure rather than only relying on AWS, google, and Microsoft, and if that is true it will also drive demand for Nvidia chips, though I doubt to the same extent.   But even if we hit the Bust stage, where demand is lower than before, I don't see Nvidia going back to where they were before Chatgpt launched, where majority of their revenue is from gaming. I think their revenue will ""normalize"" and their revenue will grow at a more ""reasonable"", double digit rate with majority of their earnings from AI chips.   That's my $0.02.",No. The music eventually stops but no one knows when.,"Nvidia's success is directly proportional to how many people think AI is going to be, not how useful AI actually is.",As much as their dividend,Why do people use Chat GPT to write reddit posts?,"It feels like people are betting on Nvidia being the indispensable company making AI hardware for a new economy that runs on AI in perpetuity.  But in some ways it seems less like anyone is sure this will happen, and more they don't want to be left out in case it does.  They don't want to be that one chump that thought Nvidia was just a fad in the 5 year run up to their decades of permanent dominance.  I'm not sure how much of this is FOMO and how much of it is an earnest belief that the global economy will shift to running on AI.  Probably a bit of both.","I'm a career tech person.   NVIDIA has a strong market position that isn't going to be undermined anytime soon. Beyond the silicon, the CUDA software stack doesn't (yet) have any comparable alternatives. Some are in the works, but the mindshare around CUDA is going to force alternatives to emulate the CUDA interfaces, which gives NVIDIA a lot of steering power over the broader software development landscape.  Also, NVIDIA's commitment earlier this year to open source development of their drivers in the Linux Kernel is a commitment to the Linux kernel and kernel development processes that will enable them to drive value up the software stack for years to come.   A big part of the valuation picture revolves around NVIDIA's ability to manage their position in the broader technology ecosystem. There's plenty of room for them to grow and the demand for GPUs is only going to continue as e.g. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all scramble to light-up nuclear power plants to fuel AI's massive energy demands. If NVIDIA is able to meaningfully contribute to addressing the power consumption of their hardware, they will only continue to increase their valuation.","""*Some have even compared the current AI boom to the dot-com bubble, but there‚Äôs one critical difference: Earnings.*""  That's not really true though. CSCO had lots of very real and growing earnings in the dotcom bubble. It became the most valuable stock in the world just like NVDA is today. And yet despite all the inflation in the last quarter century CSCO has STILL not been able to surpass its old dotcom bubble highs.  Just because things look great today for NVDA and they're growing earnings rapidly today doesn't mean that things won't end badly for people buying into the stock at today's valuation.","Blackrock reported recently that the top 4 (I think Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta) will invest $200B this year in AI centric data centers, expected to grow to $700B annually by the end of this decade. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-17/ai-s-1-trillion-hysteria-offers-fat-payday-for-wall-street-bankers  I don‚Äôt think people realize what‚Äôs going on here if they doubt that at least moderate growth for Nvidia can be sustained for decades, if they execute perfectly, keep innovative edge and so on. But the market is there for sure.","The part of the story we haven't seen work yet is where spending $100B/year on AI chips results in &gt; $100B additional revenue.  Big tech has enough cash flow that so long as they believe the investment will pay off eventually (in 5 or 10 years even) they can building out more capacity and upgrading hardware I guess, but at some point it becomes irresponsible.  As a user I'm skeptical because I like tools to produce reliable answers or at least answers for which I can assess reliability.  In the case of LLMs where a lot of the hype is, they're often just confidently wrong if I know a good bit about what I'm asking."

If I will be living in the Philippines for 70% of the year, this should be a no brainer, correct? My goal: live financially free with little work (USA not possible with that interest income but PH would be easily doable). Your thoughts?","It depends on how old you are. If you‚Äôre 70 yo, I think this is a great idea. If you‚Äôre under 40, you will lose so much of the values of your million by the time you‚Äôre 70 that you will regret not helping your hard earned money keep up with inflation.","On the opposite side of that. Getting to spend your younger years not working has so much value in itself. I was laid off this year and had a few months severance. It was truely the best time I‚Äôve had in a long time.

The possibility of erosion of purchasing power is too likely, happened many times through modern market history.  The 4% number we throw around for retirement means that you withdraw 4%  of the initial nest egg and then inflation adjust that number going forward. Inflation can outstrip bond yields and cause bond selloffs. Since its bonds youll still be getting your coupons, but their effective purchasing power can drop fast in the real world.  You need to be invested in equities to outstrip inflation and maintain portfolio purchasing power.",Yes I see your point.

Government bonds are very low risk but if inflation outpaces the interest rates you‚Äôre left with a loss of purchasing power at maturity.   Meanwhile with blue chips the actual market value will typically keep up with inflation meaning you don‚Äôt have to worry as much about loss of purchasing power and they pay dividends comparable to long term bonds making them a much better option.  The only advantage bonds have over blue chips is during an extended recession and even then it‚Äôs a very minimal advantage because blue chips are typically a lot less effected by economic conditions then growth stocks would be.,Investing isn‚Äôt about getting rich quick that‚Äôs the actual ‚Äúpleb‚Äù mindset.

The asshole financial manager in California my mother trusted with her investment and insurance accounts cleaned out all her investment money and gave it to her husband (not my father)-- also a client of his, but NOT a beneficiary and not named anywhere on the account for any reason.  My mother had advanced dementia at the time, which the financial manager was well aware of because he managed her long-term care insurance and filed the caretaker paperwork.  I was my now-deceased mother's POA, the financial advisor never contacted me for any reason, but he accepted a CA state form from the husband in which the husband named himself POA. That form was notarized the very same day my mother's doctor noted ""advanced dementia"" during an office visit.   I filed a complaint with the SEC, they did jack shit nothing.  Neither did the CA state office that manages the notary program. The financial advisor is still in business and has had at least one previous SEC fine for doing something similar to what he did with my mother's money.   Is there anything I can do? My mother trusted her financial advisor to protect her $ from her husband's greedy daughter and they all betrayed her the minute she became incapacitated.   And if you're still reading this- my mother owned her house long before she met her husband, it was paid for. Two years after her first diagnosis of cognitive decline, the husband took a $200,000 loan out against the house and gave it to his daughter.

He was a trustee on a joint trust. End of discussion. FA did nothing wrong, and OP doesn‚Äôt understand how trusts work.","Although it might seem unfair, most of this doesn't sound illegal.  A spouse has more rights than a child, especially if you're an adult child.  Unless there are specific directions via financial documents (trust, will, beneficiary designation, etc), then all the money defaults to the surviving spouse.  In fact, there are some retirement accounts where your mom's husband would have to sign off to change the beneficiary to someone other than him because he's legally entitled to it.  Regarding the POA for your mom on the day she was diagnosed... if there were estate planning documents, they probably established the POA rights beforehand and her husband was added that day because they already planned for it.  Even if you didn't have the POA approved beforehand, then a doctor's note is what's necessary to establish one.  Unfortunately, a poorly planned estate plan doesn't equal theft or fraud.  And also, not all parents care to leave money to their children... at least not as a primary beneficiary.  You might've been listed as a contingent beneficiary in the event your mother and her husband died at the same time, but that didn't happen so he got it all.  I'm a CFP/financial advisor and I'm privy to these conversations when people are alive.

Did your mother ever re-title her bank accounts, assets, etc. so that the trust was the legal owner? If not, then whatever terms your mother has in her trust aren't relevant.  What's very common is that people will set up trusts, and then forget to title their assets so that the trust is the owner. That means that those assets will then the governed by the will and, more specifically to California, the state's community property laws.  You need to speak to an attorney here because from what you've described it's not clear that the financial adviser has done anything illegal.","Idk about this. Sounds like you are mad about presumed inheritance is gone. She married someone and they became POA. If you were already POA, did you establish that on the accounts with the advisor? The advisor cant even take your instructions if they dont have it on file with their custodian, did he even know you? Why would there be any reason not to accept POA instructions from a spouse? At the end of the day, the advisor can advise against closing out accounts, but its not their job to say no to properly requested withdrawals. They are a fiduciary to act in clients best interest, report suspected abuse and service clients as is. If you didnt establish your relationship before it went down, its an uphill battle to claw anything back, since you are not the spouse."

Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High**   Palantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers.  [GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.    **2. Revenue Growth Isn‚Äôt Scaling as Expected**   While Palantir‚Äôs revenue growth has been solid, it‚Äôs showing signs of deceleration:  * FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth * FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth  This deceleration doesn‚Äôt justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.  **3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**   Despite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.  **4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**   The market has been overly optimistic about Palantir‚Äôs AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It‚Äôs easy to talk AI; it‚Äôs harder to monetize it sustainably.  **5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**   Executives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.

Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**   Palantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir‚Äôs dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.  **TL;DR:**   Palantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels.

Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter.

I mean I can see both sides but Vanguard literally tells you ""Target date funds should not be held in taxable accounts"" but I get not everyone reads the prospectus or the warnings of the funds","Vanguard Reaches $40 Million Settlement in Target-Date Fund Lawsuit  By Andrew Welsch Follow  Nov. 7, 2024 8:20 am ET  Vanguard has agreed to pay $40 million to settle a lawsuit brought by a group of investors over changes Vanguard made to target-date funds that the investors say stuck them with massive tax bills.  The company may pay additional costs, such as attorney‚Äôs fees and administrative expenses. Details of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, were filed in a federal court in Philadelphia on Nov. 6.  Phillip Kim, a lawyer at the Rosen Law firm representing the plaintiffs, declined to comment. A representative of Vanguard said the company ‚Äúis committed to supporting everyday investors and retirement savers and is happy to have reached an agreement that allows us to put this litigation behind us.‚Äù  The settlement comes more than two years after investors in Vanguard‚Äôs target-date funds filed their initial complaint seeking class action status in a federal court in Philadelphia in March 2022. The investors had accused Vanguard of breach of fiduciary duty over changes to target-date funds that resulted in what they say were large unnecessary capital gains distributions.  The investors said in a court filing that settling the case will cut short the time and costs associated with a trial and further litigation. ‚ÄúPlaintiffs have determined, therefore, that the settlement set forth in this stipulation is fair, adequate, reasonable, and in the best interests of the settlement class,‚Äù the filing states.  The settlement represents approximately 15.4% of the maximum damages estimated by an expert hired by the plaintiffs. The actual amount individual wronged investors will get depends on how many investors seek recompense, according to court filings.  The two sides began mediation talks in September and indicated last week that they were nearing an agreement.  Target-date funds are popular with retirement savers seeking a set-it-and-forget approach. The funds contain a mix of stocks and bonds. As the funds near their target-date, typically the year an investor expects to retire, they automatically rebalance the mix.  Vanguard target-date funds had two tiers: an institutional tier for large retirement plans with more than $100 million in assets and a second tier for individual investors and smaller retirement plans, according to the investors‚Äô lawsuit. The institutional tier had lower fees.  In December 2020, Vanguard dropped the threshold for the institutional tier to $5 million. That change prompted a stampede of small retirement plans out of the second tier and into the cheaper institutional tier. The non-institutional funds were thus forced to sell assets and realize capital gains, which they then distributed to the funds‚Äô remaining investors, according to the lawsuit. Investors who held the funds in taxable accounts got stuck with ‚Äúmassive tax bills,‚Äù according to the lawsuit.  The lawsuit said Vanguard had other options that wouldn‚Äôt have resulted in capital gains, such as merging the tiers, which it did in September 2021.  The company has denied the allegations in court filings.",novice nvestors aren't savvy enough to understand the implication &amp; impact of such statement.    it's even worse when the warning is written in small print in the prospectus.,"It wasn't necessary and they could have just merged the funds with no consequences to investors (which is what they ended up doing a year later). Somebody messed up, which is why they are settling a class action lawsuit now. Vanguard messed up.","There's plenty of reasons to go broader than that, into both the US extended and international markets. Real TDFs handle that.   And there's sequence of returns issues around retirement that the TDF glide path can help with.",I'm sure you've read every ToS presented to you,"Quick question here, about this paragraph:  *In December 2020, Vanguard dropped the threshold for the institutional tier to $5 million.

Why didn't the fund managers simply with the stroke of a pen (keyboard?) simply transfer assets from the small investor tier, to the institutional tier? If it is the same fund, they are investing in the same stocks with the same ratios of money in each stock, correct?",The lawyers will split $30M and each investor will get about check for tree-fiddy.,"When I started investing, I had a bunch of mutual funds in my taxable account and Fidelity was nice enough to give me a courtesy call to remind me of the ""tax implications"".

Lastly, I‚Äôm not sure if there is a dictionary definition of ‚Äúblue chip‚Äù, but in my book it just means highly impactful and reliable household names that will not go away any time soon, and by that definition, Nvidia is definitely a blue chip (despite its high multiples), and its forward P/E is honestly ‚Äúnot even that high‚Äù compared to the likes of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.",This comment is entrapment,"I did, doubled my money and sold...  ... in 2018 ü•≤","&gt;Plus you're replacing a $100B company with a $3T company.  doesnt matter since for some reason this index is price weighted, not market cap.","Feels bad.

What I did: 1. I took all Motley Fool Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers picks from February 2022 until February 1, 2024. Two years of stock picks and treated them, on a spreadsheet without DRIP, as a buy and hold asset.  2. On the same dates as the MF picks, I also have the VOO ETF prices and treated them, on a spreadsheet without DRIP, as a buy and hold asset.  3. Waiting until almost 2 years, got impatient, and compared their growth to today‚Äôs date.  What I found:  - If you picked and held every MF pick, you would have a 44.13% gain without dividends. - The gain variation would be -69.09% to 334.22% - 31/96 stock picks lost value.  - If you bought and held VOO, you would have 42.73% gain without dividends.   Overall: The big winners overshadow the losers and make the MF picks close to the VOO ETF However, if you use the picks as a platform to begin your own research and follow MF‚Äôs advice on owning a limited number of stocks, you could end up a big winner if you‚Äôre lucky/good?","Let us know the results after 5, 10, 20, 30 years",2 years is an insignificant amount of time.,"For fun, run the same analysis a few times with random picks.","I wanted to see if their stats were being propped up by their huge older wins (Amazon, Netflix, etc).

Other services like their dividend one and hidden gems I think have lagged the market, but they haven‚Äôt been around longer than 5-10 years I believe","If you could only pick winners and not pick losers is a garbage premise. Even people with infinite resources and investment knowledge fail routinely to do this. That's why the SP500 outperforms something like 98% of fund managers over the course of 30 years. Even if your 2 year sample, a +2% outperformance is not worth the extra effort and risk you take on.","Totally fair, also potentially true. I think around 2018-2020 they started making more recs and by doing so they ran out of really great companies and started adding in some not great ones. They also tend not to factor in current price on recs, so even some decent recs would be way better buying in during a dip than at whatever 3 digit PE they recs at. Like almost every rec in 2020 and 2021 is negative, I think 5/48 are green and 2 beat the market.      I like them for stock ideas, I think it‚Äôs worth a cheap subscription. But I wouldn‚Äôt (and don‚Äôt) buy every rec. I instantly ignore maybe half of their recs and do my own research on the other half, buying maybe 4-6 a year. They also re rec the same companies a lot, like TDOC was rec‚Äôd 4 times, the first 2 were at slightly reasonable prices and pre covid. Then the second 2 were after it 4x‚Äôd in 6 months, ultimately crashing from the 4th rec of $200 to the final sell of $15. Personally I saw the writing on the wall, everyone and their mother had their own telehealth service so why was Tedoc at such a premium? Sorry for the tangent, point was you could immediately ignore 2-3 of their buy recs just by looking at the company and thinking ‚Äúhey why is this trading at 80x sales and has no income?‚Äù. If you do that then you‚Äôll miss the biggest losers and still have the best winners max","All the more proof and reason to just buy VOO/VTI and relax. Far less risk, time involved, and proven over a longer track record.","For what it's worth, I'd did something similar. I tracked my ETFs and Stocks (most were Motley Fool recommendations), then compared the percentage growth between both categories. Even with numerous stocks in the red, the overall growth of that category was better because of the winners that ran vs the ETFs (which had no losses). That said, as I've gotten older, I just invest in a few total market ETFs for simplicity."

investing,Nov,1h0050p,Most big airline stocks are up by 33-166% since August. Any ideas why?,"I recently noticed that United Airlines went through the roof in the last few months, so I looked at a bunch of other airlines and found that most of them are doing really well since the first week of August. Most of them were going downhill until then, but then they collectively went up really fast, even though at the same time we saw the largest plunge in the stock market in two years. Why is that?      Some examples from August until today:   US:   United: 34,61 to 92,40‚Ç¨ (+166%)   Delta: 32,45 to 62,44‚Ç¨ (+92%)   American: 8,37 to 14,22‚Ç¨ (+69%)   Southwest: 21,91 to 31,19‚Ç¨ (+42%)   Also Jetblue and Skywest.

A Forbes article believes that it's because of lower fuel prices, but is that enough for those massive gains? And why are there some major airlines that aren't doing well at all, like Lufthansa, KLM (Air France) and of course Spirit? Fuel Prices should help all of them equally.   I also read, that it's because of Trump's re-election, because he wants to loosen regulations. But that wasn't in August, so that doesn't make much sense either.      Any ideas? Is this an opportunity?",Price of oil went down.

An empty 747 weighs 325,660 pounds(fuel is also quite heavy).

Everyone's traveling now, after the lul of the lock downs. Inter continental and long distance travel is up. Essentially people took few vacations in the past years but now things are fully opened. Yes lock downs were lifted in 2022 but it takes a while for people to fully plan things.  2. Economy is doing good for some people. Yes inflation etc, but those who can afford a trip abroad are earning well. And they're spending.  3. Airlines have discovered nickel and diming costs to consumer, eg checked bag, assigned seating, etc.  4. The good airlines are going up.

Contribute a portion of my monthly income to said account (say $360).  4.  Wait 30 years...  5. Have $650,861.59 (considering an average of 9% yield annually) in value on that investment...then what? Is that money liquid? Is it just sorta....there statically?     My thing is this...if it is NOT that simple...what am I missing? If it IS that simple...then why wouldn't everybody DO something at LEAST that basic (to varying degrees since people vary in how fortunate they are and where they can start) to outpace inflation.  I am obviously very new to this and I want to make sure that I am not getting sold to or dazzled. I have never invested in my life and am just trying to see the angle here. I am not a ""wheeler and dealer"" or anything like that....I don't like risk.

You won't be young forever, your body will start to ache, you WILL get tired of working, you WILL want to slow down. So at the end of it all , you start pushing 60 and look at your savings/investments and you best have saved while you could.  It is a very comforting thought to see that you have a enough money invested to retire on. That you have something to show for the work you have done.  I couldn't imagine having to work well into my 60's because I HAD to.  FWIW, I will be 62 tomorrow, I KNOW what it is like to be young and the future is cloudy and uncertain but it is also so far off that it doesn't really matter, I also KNOW what it is like to age and learn what life has to teach and the take away of all that is you are ultimately responsible for yourself and your own future.   It was worth the sacrifice to delay gratification, to save for the future. I look forward to doing what I want to do, when I want to do it, without someone telling me if I can or can not do it, and most importantly, what tools to use when I do it. No one will have a claim check on me or my time. No one. I am only beholden to my spouse.  The thought of having that level of liberty makes me feel young again. : )  Oh yeah, like someone else mentioned. It really is simple. Start young and save what you can. Spend a little, save a lot.

You never know how you'll react until you actually experience it. Imagine your portfolio going down nearly every day for 3 straight years. That's a long time of losing that breaks a lot of people.",Yes. Human psychology is the reason most people don‚Äôt do this. They either;  - are impatient - got scared because the market went down - think they can do better - don‚Äôt understand the concept of compounding,"My father-in-law lived by this creed. He is 73 now and lives off of a couple grand a month from social security because he can‚Äôt work from an injury. He relies on my brother-in-law for most things.

investing,Nov,1gwlxsq,SEC Chair Gary Gensler to Depart Agency on January 20,"Washington D.C., Nov. 21, 2024 ‚Äî  The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that its 33rd Chair, Gary Gensler, will step down from the Commission effective at 12:00 pm on January 20, 2025. Chair Gensler began his tenure on April 17, 2021, in the immediate aftermath of the GameStop market events. He led the agency through a robust rulemaking agenda to enhance efficiency, resiliency, and integrity in the U.S. capital markets. He also oversaw high-impact enforcement cases to hold wrongdoers accountable and return billions to harmed investors.  ‚ÄúThe Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,‚Äù said Chair Gensler. ‚ÄúThe staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.  ‚ÄúI thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor. I‚Äôve greatly enjoyed working with my fellow Commissioners, Allison Herren Lee, Elad Roisman, Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda, and Jaime Liz√°rraga. I also thank Congress, my colleagues across the U.S. government, and fellow regulators around the world.‚Äù  **Treasury Markets**  During Chair Gensler‚Äôs tenure, the SEC adopted critical enhancements to the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury markets. To lower cost and risk in the Treasury markets, the agency adopted rules to promote central clearing and narrow circumstances in which broker-dealers are exempt from national securities association registration. These reforms will lower risk and enhance efficiency throughout the entirety of the U.S. capital markets.  **Equity Markets**  Under Chair Gensler, the SEC made the first significant updates to the $55 trillion U.S. equity market in nearly 20 years. The agency unanimously made updates to the National Market System so that stocks can be traded more efficiently with narrower spreads and lower fees. Improvements also include shortening the settlement cycle to one day, which is good for investors and lowers risk in the market. Further, the agency unanimously adopted rules to update information regarding brokers‚Äô execution quality. These reforms benefit investors by making equity markets more efficient.  **Resiliency**  The Commission adopted amendments during Chair Gensler‚Äôs tenure regarding Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds. The amended rules require that large hedge fund and private equity fund advisers make current reports on certain events to the Commission. The SEC further amended Form PF jointly with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to improve the quality of the information the agencies receive from all Form PF filers, and those changes will be implemented next year. Finally, the Commission adopted reforms to money market funds to make them more resilient, liquid, and transparent, including in times of stress.  **Corporate Governance**  To better promote trust in the capital markets, the SEC under Chair Gensler adopted a number of changes regarding corporate governance, including updating the rules for when corporate insiders can sell their shares, for when executives have to give back compensation based on erroneously reported financials, and for disclosure of executive pay versus performance. The agency also adopted new rules to allow shareholders to vote their preferred mix of board candidates on universal proxy cards in contested director elections. Additionally, the Commission adopted rules requiring more timely disclosure by those who are seeking control and buy more than a 5 percent stake in a company.  **Disclosure**  Since April 2021, the Commission has adopted several rules to ensure that investors get the disclosure they need from public companies and companies seeking to go public, broker-dealers, and investment advisors.  First, the Commission adopted rules to enhance disclosure around public company issuers‚Äô cyber and climate risks, as well as for those companies seeking to go public via a special purpose acquisition company. The rules are grounded in materiality, as investors need this information to make buying, selling, holding, and voting decisions.  Second, the Commission adopted rules requiring certain broker-dealers and investment advisers to notify customers of data breaches that might put personal information at risk.  Finally, the Commission enhanced transparency to the markets by regularly publishing aggregate, anonymized data regarding registered investment funds, private funds, and investment advisers.  **Accounting and Auditing**  During Chair Gensler‚Äôs tenure, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), overseen by the SEC, successfully negotiated a Statement of Protocol with Chinese market authorities to allow the PCAOB to fully inspect and investigate, for the first time, the auditors of China-related companies listed in the United States. For the last two years, the PCAOB has been able to fulfill its inspection and enforcement-related responsibilities as it relates to audit firms in China and Hong Kong.  Further, in April 2021, the PCAOB had only updated five of the standards it adopted on an interim basis when it was created 20 years ago. The interim standards had been carried over from existing American Institute of Certified Public Accountants standards, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act envisioned that the PCAOB would update them soon after its creation. Since Chair Gensler was sworn in, the PCAOB has updated 18 interim standards and two other standards to reflect the current oversight needs in accounting and auditing.  **Examinations and Enforcement**  The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations, which make up about half of the agency, have been steadfast cops on the beat during Chair Gensler‚Äôs tenure. The agency received more than 145,000 tips, complaints, and referrals and awarded approximately $1.5 billion to whistleblowers. The Commission filed more than 2,700 enforcement actions and obtained approximately $21 billion in penalties and disgorgement orders. Between fiscal years 2021 and 2024, the agency returned more than $2.7 billion to harmed investors as a result of enforcement actions.  Further, the SEC recovered more than $250 million for harmed investors through examination of investment advisors, investment companies, and broker dealers, among others. The Division of Examinations also enhanced communication with registrants by sharing more timely information about its annual priorities and observations and proactively engaging with industry and other regulators.  Under Chair Gensler, the Commission continued the work Chair Jay Clayton began to protect investors in the crypto markets. During Chair Gensler‚Äôs tenure, the agency brought actions against crypto intermediaries for fraud, wash trading, registration violations, and other misconduct.  In the last full fiscal year, according to the SEC‚Äôs Office of the Inspector General, 18 percent of the SEC‚Äôs tips, complaints, and referrals were crypto-related, despite the crypto markets comprising less than 1 percent of the U.S. capital markets. Court after court¬†[agreed](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424#_ftn37)¬†with the Commission‚Äôs actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered‚Äîwhatever their form.  **About Chair Gensler**  Chair Gensler was formerly Chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, leading the Obama Administration‚Äôs reform of the $400 trillion swaps market. He also was senior advisor to U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes in writing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) and was undersecretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance and assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1997-2001.  In recognition for his service, Chair Gensler was awarded the Alexander Hamilton Award, the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs highest honor. He is a recipient of the 2014 Frankel Fiduciary Prize.  Before joining the SEC, Chair Gensler was professor of the Practice of Global Economics and Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, co-director of MIT‚Äôs Fintech@CSAIL, and senior advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. From 2017-2019, he served as chair of the Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission.  Earlier in his career, Chair Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner in the Mergers &amp; Acquisition department, headed the firm‚Äôs Media Group, led fixed income &amp; currency trading in Asia, and was co-head of Finance, responsible for the firm's worldwide Controllers and Treasury efforts.  A native of Baltimore, Md., Chair Gensler earned his undergraduate degree in economics in 1978 and his MBA from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, in 1979. He has three daughters.  [https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-182](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-182)","Gensler's relentless legal enforcement against digital assets is probably the leading driver in him being so controversial. Not unique to him, of course, people often forget that the SEC under Clayton's tenure (appointed by Trump during his first term) was also fairly anti-digital assets.  Rumors of the top candidates being considered by Trump to replace Gensler are supposedly much more friendly to the digital asset sector. Regardless of personal opinions on the validity of crypto, this news is overall positive if you're speculating on the continued growth/valuation of digital assets.","It never seemed to me that the actions of the SEC under Gensler was anti-crypto. If anything, many of the actions by the SEC paved the way to legitimize certain crypto assets. And the SEC set guidelines and rules so that crypto assets like Bitcoin could be securitized and made more easily accessible to retail investors within the existing regulatory framework.  Gensler even taught a course on Bitcoin on potential blockchain applications in the financial sector when he was a professor at MIT.  The course has been released by MIT as part of their OpenCourseware initiative if anyone wants to watch the lectures - [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/)","The problem was he put most of the industry into a passive aggressive limbo.   Even Coinbase, which is as blue chip as it gets in digital assets and lawyered up, spent years in legal purgatory over staking yield while other less scrupulous companies had products.","given the stench of criminality trump needs to nominate someone and his crypto obssession, i guess he will be pardoning sam bankman-fried and nominating him","Honestly it's probably just time to say ""ok, go ahead, learn why we had these laws in the first place"".",As long as the rest of us don't have to bail the crypto bros out.,"&gt;continue to fight the good fight  What good fight? This entire new admin is pro-crypto, Gensler is hated in the crypto community. He had to go.","Trump is pro whatever he‚Äôs paid to like. Like a year ago he hated crypto, then suddenly he was all for it lol",Didn‚Äôt trump say a few weeks ago that he was going to fire Gensler right away? It wasn‚Äôt long after that when GG said he was going to resign. He was originally going to resign this month.,"The SEC has instituted some controversial rules/guidances under his tenure, and the lawsuits against Coinbase, Kraken, and Ripple Labs in particular have all been viewed negatively. Their continued position that secondary sales of digital assets constitute securities under Howey is especially contentious (a position they were ruled against in SEC v Ripple Labs in a NY federal court but have since appealed).   There certainly have been some legitimate enforcement actions, however, so not discounting that."

Anyway, I went home that night, watched a few videos on some cool stuff in quantum computing and said screw it, I‚Äôm long on quantum computing. It seriously will change our world dramatically when we inevitably figure it out. So I thought it was a deal and dumped a few grand into it.   Since then there been some pretty exciting stuff happen in the quantum computing world. Researchers have figured out how to control qubits and Amazon decided to invest $4B into their own quantum computer. D-Wave Quantum cracked a standardized binary encryption a few days ago too.  Anyway, they‚Äôre all up almost 100% since then and I decided I‚Äôm gonna stick around for the ride and go long on quantum. Quantum will expand our computing capabilities exponentially. And it‚Äôs probably sooner than we think.  Positions: QUBT - 200 shares RGTI - 500 shares QBTS - 425 shares IONQ - 25 shares",You‚Äôre supposed to post this two weeks ago.,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but legit, production quantum computers are still at least 1-2 decades away. There are a lot of business people making very broad claims, but the actual scientific state of things shows that we're far away from legit industry implementations. Limiting factor right now is error correction, it's something like for every 1 qubit, you need 100+ qubuts to do error correcting. Which means large scale and viable quantum computers will need to have 1000s of qubits.  I'd love to be wrong, but this is something I've been keeping track of and also chatting with a couple of my friends who are deep in academic research on QC quantum algos.","You‚Äôre right, but you may also watch people getting rich around you because:  stock prices and earnings are no longer related, apparently.","When we see things like these running, it's usually not a good sign for the market and especially those stocks for the next few months","RGTI, and QUBT are legit hardware makers. One more consumer based, the other more industrial. IONQ is more developer friendly, like AWS but quantum (they use aws).  Those three companies I find interesting, but I haven‚Äôt dived into all of them. For space I like SIDU value versus risk right now. I like RKLB and RDW better but not the value. Quantum names have more room to move up. QUBT is now the #1 ranked stock on seeking alpha, which says something. It‚Äôs not perfect, but usually the #1 has a good run up.",I first bought D-Wave earlier in the year when it‚Äôs $1,"It‚Äôs frustrating to see in a way. I personally bought QUBT back at 0.70 and 1$, I expected to see some slow but consistent growth over a couple decades. After the big spike I sold at 500% (400% profit) expecting it to drop back down, but it continues to climb.   There‚Äôs been no ‚Äúreal‚Äù development or change worth anywhere near this amount. Just a big jump due to speculation and hype, mainly people worried about missing out on the next big thing, the ‚Äúcrypto killer‚Äù  I‚Äôm personally hoping we see a large sell off, so that we can see some real permanent and healthy growth, rather than a pump like this",Agreed. Quantum computing getting this kind of hype and speculation for tech decades away is mind boggling. Seeing similar with nuclear and SMRs.,Charles Payne did a segment on quantum computing and went over the various players today if you want to look it up online,"That, and it's also a massive national security issue.¬† Whoever gets it first will read everyone else's encrypted data. That's why I believe it's inevitable it will happen."

Some companies true up at the end of the year so you still get the full match, but that's not super common.

One of the things he mentions, is that we should consider our social security retirement as a bond asset, a bond that is inflation protected, that pays us monthly payments. ¬†So, the cash equivalent of that is pretty high.

investing,Nov,1gy2mfa,Isn't rebalancing selling your winners and keeping your losers?,"I've been thinking about the philosophy of rebalancing. The purpose of rebalancing your portfolio (just buy all stocks bro, excluded) is to maintain a risk profile that's consistent with your goals.   So say if NVDA went up by 300% and INTC got halved and now NVDA is 80% of your portfolio. The philosophy of rebalancing would demand you to sell a large portion of NVDA and invest in INTC.   That strategy if we look at the chart, doesn't work so well for your wallet.   So here's me wondering if rebalancing on the surface is ""buy low sell high"" when in reality it's just ""sell your winners and buy more losers"".","Rebalancing individual stocks isn't a great idea for the reasons you outlined.  Rebalancing among **uncorrelated** asset classes is what the pros are talking about.  Like say you have an equity portion you might also hold gold/bitcoin, US treasury bonds, or real estate.

If my main position moved by 10%, I could not rebalance without selling something.","&gt; on the surface is ""buy low sell high"" when in reality it's just ""sell your winners and buy more losers"".  Those are synonyms.  It comes down the problem of serial correlation often called momentum.  After a stock ticks up what information have you gained:  * **Classic view:** you have gained no information.  A previous tick has no impact on future returns.  The market is efficient and what just happened is new information of some sort was priced in.   * **Momentum view:** It takes time for stocks to adjust.  A tick up makes future ticks up more likely.   * **Mean reversion view:** Markets tend to overreact and mean reverse.  A tick up makes anticipated future return lower.   Now here is the problem.  All 3 though they contradict each other are somewhat true.    Mostly while not perfectly efficient in all cases in broad strokes they are.   It is possible to make gains by either following trend / momentum or running contrary to it.  But it is not easy.  The whole idea behind cap weighted indexing is to not even bother.   However, all that being said momentum effects are very strong the shorter the time period.  A tick up does make the next tick more likely to be up than down.  Markets do have very strong short term serial correlations.  They do take time to adjust.  While after trading costs it is hard to make money exploiting momentum, simply not trading against momentum creates positive alpha.  All that being said the mean reversion view is also true.  While in the short term momentum effects, serial correlation, is positive over long time frames it turns negative.  3 months is generally where the 0 point is, though this can adjust based on the number of momentum traders and when it adjusts it adjust ferociously in favor of value strategies.  Even though value strategies, anti-momentum strategies, do worse than neutral or positive momentum strategies over most 3 year time frames they crush them over most 20 year time frames.  The market does mean revert.  Total returns over a 15 year period have an almost -1 correlation with total returns over the last 15 year period in the USA for example.

investing,Nov,1gv4bhw,Cars are a universal money pit,"I had been talking about this recently, depending on where you live, cars are necessary expense.  But they‚Äôve become truly outrageous in terms of cost, maintenance, insurance, etc. I recently had to replace the battery in my car and I was informed by AAA that if I didn‚Äôt go to the dealer, the car would recognize it and would disable itself after a certain period of time.  I tend to buy a used, low and luxury car, put very few miles on it, and get a good value when I go to trade it in or sell. The only issue with this strategy is the large upfront cost that you don‚Äôt get back until you trade it in.  I‚Äôve probably owned eight cars in my life. I‚Äôve never owned a new car even once. Even a used car of decent utility is going to cost tens of thousands of dollars.  Public transportation is often garbage in many areas and simply out of the question and huge swaths of the country such as rural areas.  I‚Äôve had many times in my life I felt ahead of the curve financially and then my car takes a dive and I either have to spend tens of thousands on one of the worst depreciating assets in existence or start shoveling cash for repairs.  Cars aren‚Äôt exactly an investment but they‚Äôre such a massive, omnipresent expense they deserve to be discussed.","&gt; I tend to buy a used, low and luxury car, put very few miles on it, and get a good value when I go to trade it in or sell.  Why?  Why not drive them till they are dead?  Sounds like you're causing some of the expense you are complaining about.","Exactly. My prefered approach is to buy new (at least back when 0% interest was a thing) and then keep the cars running forever. I know you could perhaps remove the initial depreciation hit by buying used, but between the 0% interest and the knowledge that I'll do the break in period and maintaince properly it gives piece of mind for the long game. I currently drive a 15 year old chevy (and own my home), whenever a part wears out I replace it with something better than OEM if possible (shocks, etc.). Just down the street are a bunch of section 8 apartments and \_all\_ of the cars there are newer, often used luxury cars like BMWs, Mercedes, etc. that are riddiculously expensive to do continued maintance on. I guess it's just about priorities.","I drive a 2007 toyota yaris I bought for 3,500. It needed 1k in repairs, hilariously, even with the miles I put on it, it is valued at 3,500.

It has remained excessively high for a very long time and has basically only gone up after 2009 with very brief periods of correction.

As for inflation, I'm not sure if you noticed a few years back but we had a global pandemic, which impacted ALL countries, and ALL countries experienced inflation. The US has managed the inflation reasonably well, AND has managed to land a soft landing for the economy, which is impressive to me at least.  At the core, again, I feel like you'd view things very differently if Trump was in charge.

investing,Nov,1gjk6yg,What expectations regarding the Presidential election is ‚Äúbaked in‚Äù to the current stock market pricing?,"NOT trying to make a political post, but one of objective facts and what the market is expecting.   Looking ahead at this week, do you think the market is including a win for either candidate?  In the last election, one candidate contested the outcome of the election and created a lot of uncertainty around American politics. Do you think the anticipation of that happening again is baked in?","&gt;‚ÄúWhile elections may introduce temporary market shifts, it‚Äôs key for investors to maintain a long-term perspective,‚Äù says Alex Michalka, vice president of investment research at Wealthfront. ‚ÄúWe analyzed US stock market data from 1927 to 2023 and found that election years typically don‚Äôt significantly impact investment performance, and neither does a particular party winning.‚Äù  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-24/us-election-how-to-prepare-financially-if-donald-trump-or-kamala-harris-win",From a purely statistical and historical data standpoint. The market is slightly pricing in a Trump win. Historically when polling is this close the GOP has won the electoral.   What matters more is which party takes control of the House and the Senate. Right now appears it will be a split. Which means we are going to have 4 more years of a fairly gridlocked Federal government.,Tariffs are definitely not priced in.  CEOs must think they can talk some sense to Trump about not implementing tariffs.,"This.  People who think they have a good answer to the question, don't know shit.",I'd agree typically. But it doesn't seem like the big tariff talk is priced in and that can be unilaterally implemented. I would suggest we have a Kamala win factored in because of the grid lock you reference.

Home builder has to jack up costs as he chases cheaper domestic supply, constraints abound. You see the cost of plywood during the Pandemic? That was supply chain issues at just one point. A tariff can target those points. The cascading effects will ripple fast and consumers pay more.   Mercantilism is a race to the bottom and begets revenge legislation. Globalization left behind many, I get that. Mercantilism is not the answer to that problem however.","I wouldn't bet on Cruz losing. I'm not sure how a man who nobody likes keeps winning elections, but he finds a way.","For what it's worth, I think the markets will take off after a Democratic win. Don't ask meow. It's a gut feel.","&gt; Do you think the anticipation of that happening again is baked in?  Not a black-and-white answer.    Much depends on the magnitude of victory/loss.  If it's as close as ""the polls"" suggest, then the uncertainty continues for days, weeks, whatever.  If it's closer to a blowout for one side or the other, then the uncertainty resolves fairly quickly.  And **everything** in between."

Mortgage rates are high, so real estate might not be an option (though I suppose REITs could be).    While the US equities market has pretty consistently been the best investment vehicle worldwide for 85 years, I am concerned the incoming US administration will screw something up badly and irrevocably - Japan tanked their economy in the 90s and never really recovered before they started falling off the demographic cliff, the UK Brexited themselves, and something on that scale or larger totally could happen here.   What's cheap right now?

I‚Äôm in my 40s now and I‚Äôve started adding in some bonds but it‚Äôs less than 5% of assets currently.,"I mean, last time VOO would lose to a TDF would be the lost decade, so well within my lifetime so far.  I think going full equity is perfectly fine, as long as volatility and a potential second GFC 55% drawdown doesnt make you act irrationally. For all of market history, if you just kept a cool head and kept investing rather than sell when the markets down, youll be perfectly fine holding pure diversified equities. Especially if you throw in some international, since international diversification is a free lunch.","If you won't retire for another 10-15 years why would you want 20% bonds?

investing,Nov,1gstkhv,Buying a home vs. Stocks for appreciation.,"So we currently own and live in a townhomr with roughly $100k equity.  We loved apartment style living and would love to go back to it.  We have roughly 100k also saved up for another down-payment.  One option is to look for an apt and rent out the townhome with property management  company.  We likely make a few hundred per month taking into account PM fees, repairs, unoccupied months etc.  I will mention the home is in a high demand area.  We invest the 100k or so amount that would have been used in a down-payment in some type of index fund.    Other option is to keep the townhome and purchase another home that is more to our liking.   Make the 20% down-payment and live in the new home while continuing to rent out old townhome.  Purely from a financial perspective,  does it boil down to the stocks outperforming the 2nd home appreciation over 10 or 15 years? Assuming, home costs with taxes etc month to month same as apt.  I am missing some major variables here, what are they?","Bought a house in the Seattle area for $362K cash in 2007. That house has a Zillow value of $650,000 now which seems great, but using a calculator for 17 years of returns (at a relatively conservative 7%) yields $1.07M. I think actual returns of the SP 500 have been even better, VTI was about $76 in 2007 and $290 now, so that‚Äôs over $1.3M + dividends.  Strictly as an investment, it‚Äôs clear that an index fund was a better choice, but many other things would have to come into play such as intangible benefits to owning your home, how much your rent would have been, and what geographical area you live in and did it appreciate.",Not exactly a fair comparison.  You would have also paid ~$400k in rent in those 17 years not having owned the home.,"You also need to take into account how much was paid in property taxes, home owners insurance, mortgage interest, maintenance etc.  Even when homes appreciate a lot in value its is not as great of an investment as people think",A bad tenant is the most infuriating thing in the world is what drives my aversion to RE investing.,"Food for thought OP.   My family moved from a midwestern suburb to a PNW suburb in the early 80's. We sold the midwestern home for $100k and bought the PNW home for $135k. Flash forward 40 years and the midwestern home is presently valued at $350k, so it hasn't even kept up with inflation. Meanwhile, the PNW home is presently valued at ~$2 million.   All other issues like maintenance, insurance, taxes, etc. aside, you also want to be pretty conscious of location if you're hoping to see a ROI","Buying a home isn't a strictly financial decision to live in isn't an investment from my point of view. Unless you are one of those individuals that like to buy fixer uppers, live a couple years, then flip or something along those lines. When you live in a home, you are consuming the thing it can potentially produce (rent). If you are going to buy a bigger home for investment, do you actually value the thing it 'produces'?  Even with price appreciation, there's no way to liquidate your second bathroom to pay for your kid's college for instance. (Not getting into HELOCs and stuff, which is another topic).","You‚Äôre right but missing tax benefits. The mortgage interest deduction, depreciation and most costs associated with owning a rental property are tax sinks which can offset some of the downsides you‚Äôve mentioned.   I‚Äôm basically in favor of buying up leveraged RE if you can get/have great interest rates or ROI.   People often forget that even in big market crashes rentals tend to still rent. So your stock portfolio could nose dive but rentals can be steady. Bad tenants are quite bad and vacancies can hurt but there‚Äôs definitely a place for real property in the mix.","I‚Äôve asked this very question. Stocks provides diversification, liquidity, and as passive as it gets. A rental property, even with using a property still isn‚Äôt as passive. You may need to approve major repairs, appreciation is totally concentrated in the local market dynamics. I even asked about tax write offs. It‚Äôs essentially deferred until you sell the rental and then it‚Äôs recaptured unless you do a 1031 exchange to another property. After a year of being a landlord, I‚Äôve decided to sell next year and invest the proceeds. In looking at appreciation of a property and how much equity you have, be sure to take into account the taxes and fees you‚Äôd pay when selling, that‚Äôs the real amount you‚Äôll actually see and the profit that really matters.","For sure, that‚Äôs why I put rent in the second paragraph as one of a few caveats.","Yes but by buying the property cash you missed out on one of the biggest benefits of real estate: leverage. With a 20% down payement you would have spent $72,000 of your own money. Then when you sell you get $650,000.    The $72,000 plus about $200,000 in interest over the 17 years leaves you with a gain of $378,000 vs $380,000 that investing in the SP500 would have done over the same period. But you get the benefit of paying no taxes on the sale because it's your primary residence."

investing,Nov,1gvzdm2,Can someone explain to me Microstrategy?,"The price goes up so fast and I believe it is mainly institutional buyers.... why they buy MSTR instead of just Bitcoin? I am not here to debate whether Bitcoin is good investment, I am just curious why people are willing to pay a super premium to buy a Bitcoin holding company? Please explain to me, an amateur.","There are two components feeding into this MSTR flywheel. The stock price premium and convertible bonds.  ---  **Stock Price Premium**  MicroStrategy leverages its stock price premium (200%+ above its Bitcoin holdings) to grow its Bitcoin per share efficiently:  -     Example: Raising $1 billion at a 216% premium results in just $316 million in dilution but adds $1 billion in Bitcoin. Each raise increases Bitcoin per share, further fueling the premium in a self-reinforcing cycle.  -     The strategy combines:    1. Bitcoin price appreciation     2. Bitcoin Yield - efficiently raising capital at a premium    3. Leverage - low-interest debt adds further returns.    -   This could potentially grow $15 billion into $87 billion over five years, but it hinges on sustaining the premium. If it collapses, the strategy breaks.  -     Owning 252,000 BTC (more than all public companies combined) positions MicroStrategy as a unique bridge between traditional finance and Bitcoin, with future potential in lending or derivatives.  ---  **Convertible Bonds**  MicroStrategy‚Äôs convertible bonds attract investors by combining bond safety with Bitcoin upside:  - Investors lend money via bonds (e.g., 0.75% interest) with the option to convert to $MSTR shares. This gives exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs growth without directly holding it.  - Investor Benefits:      - Downside Protection: Fixed interest payments and principal repayment safeguard against Bitcoin volatility.      - Upside Potential: If $MSTR stock rises with Bitcoin, bondholders can convert and profit.      - Premium Boost: Since $MSTR trades at a premium, conversion offers amplified returns compared to Bitcoin alone.  -      An investor buying $1,000 in bonds earns annual interest but can convert to shares if Bitcoin rallies, gaining equity upside with limited risk.  ---  In other words, suddenly there are these spicy bonds that have the upside of Bitcoin and bond investors are gorging.   I've long said my bull case for BTC isn't hyperbitcoinization. It's merely that a few percent of the bond market (which is notionally much larger than the equity market) will be shaved off and go into Bitcoin.   Saylor essentially made himself that conduit.   Note: This isn‚Äôt investment advice or a recommendation in any direction and just descriptive. The NAV hovering way up here is honestly pretty scary, but I could see it persisting through the bull cycle. Personally I think miners might be the better catchup trade.","As a long time holder of Microstrategy, this is the best explanation I‚Äôve seen yet of their business strategy. Have an upvote and then some.","Its a ponzi scheme, nothing much to explain about it. Ponzi schemes are wildly profitable if you are in early","Bill huang had primes , Michael sailor has retail   One of them is in prison, the other will soon end up there   Yes in salty i missed the run","Microstrategy is a perfect example of how stupid investors make stupid investing decisions a great way to print free money, until suddenly it isn't and then you're screwed because you're stuck with a bunch of unproductive assets.  There was a time when investors didn't put a discount on conglomerates. So it would be possible for a high PE tech company to buy up say a low PE grocery store company bringing in the same amount of revenue &amp; profits as them, only for stupid investors to reward them by doubling their market cap even though groceries have nothing to do with their tech business, simply because ""hey it's still a tech business, so the entire earnings should get the same high PE ratio!"".   This created some companies that were ""serial acquirerers"" that would just constantly grow their earnings only through acquisitions of low PE companies in hopes of stupid investors continuing to raise their market cap. But then when stupid investors finally wised up to how stupid their business model is, and how it was just a bunch of completely unrelated businesses (most of which were being mismanaged by the new management) they were no longer able to print money, and suddenly had a lot of problems with taking on way too much debt for all those acquisitions that weren't very good deals.  IMO Microstrategy is going to be another company talked about in investing books at some point of stupid investors enabling that kind of stupidity, only for the stock to fall off a cliff once investors realize how stupid it is.","I don't get the upside for the people buying the bonds. The interest is 0.75% which is not that high, and converting the bond to MSTR whose NAV is 1/3 of the stock price. So basically someone's borrowing $10k to MSTR, getting $75 a year for it, and they can convert that to MSTR eventually which holds an equivalent of $3.3k of Bitcoin. Without the assumption the price of MSTR will pump, sounds like a pretty bad deal.","Yea, I understand that people want to buy leveraged btc, but the premium is crazy","Saylor isn‚Äôt breaking any laws.

I see this 10 percent number all the time.  But then I recently also learned that dividend yields for S&amp;P500 are about 3 percent annually. But I rarely see this ever discussed in the context of S&amp;P500 price.  So does that 10 percent number already incorporate the 3 percent in dividends?

Didn‚Äôt sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.  The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI‚Äôs issues and Nvidia‚Äôs Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.   Thoughts? Should I continue to hold?

investing,Nov,1gpmq17,How to strategically think about tax-loss harvesting,"Hey all,   I just wanted to share an article I wrote about tax-loss harvesting, as I see these topics come up quite frequently in different ways. As we're nearing both tax season and year-end, I thought this might be useful for consideration as you all look at and evaluate your portfolios. Nothing to promote, just helpful info. I'll be around today to answer any questions you might have!   **Capital Gains and Strategically Harvesting Losses**  Managing investments effectively involves more than choosing the right assets; it also requires a smart approach to tax planning. Understanding *capital gains* and the strategy of *tax-loss harvesting* can help you optimize your investment returns by reducing tax liability. In this article, we‚Äôll explore the basics of capital gains, how they‚Äôre taxed, and how you can strategically harvest losses to reduce your tax bill.  **What Are Capital Gains?**  A **capital gain** occurs when you sell an asset‚Äîsuch as stocks, real estate, or other investments‚Äîfor more than you paid for it. The difference between your purchase price (also called *basis*) and the selling price represents your gain. There are two types of capital gains, each with distinct tax implications:  1. **Short-Term Capital Gains**: Gains from assets held for one year or less are classified as short-term and are taxed as ordinary income, which means they are subject to your regular income tax rate. 2. **Long-Term Capital Gains**: Gains from assets held for more than one year are classified as long-term and are taxed at a lower, preferential rate. As of 2023, long-term capital gains tax rates in the U.S. range from 0% to 20%, depending on your taxable income.  Because of these preferential rates, holding assets for longer than a year can significantly reduce the taxes you‚Äôll owe upon sale.  **What Is Tax-Loss Harvesting?**  **Tax-loss harvesting** is a strategy used to offset capital gains by selling assets that have declined in value. By realizing (or ‚Äúharvesting‚Äù) these losses, you can reduce your taxable gains and potentially lower your overall tax liability. The strategy works best when you have investments that are performing well and some that are underperforming.  **How Does Tax-Loss Harvesting Work?**  Here‚Äôs a step-by-step example to illustrate tax-loss harvesting in action:  1. **Identify Underperforming Investments**: Review your portfolio and identify investments that have decreased in value since purchase. 2. **Sell to Realize a Loss**: Sell these underperforming investments, locking in a loss. For example, if you bought shares in Company A for $5,000, and they‚Äôre now worth $3,000, selling them would realize a $2,000 capital loss. 3. **Offset Gains**: Apply the capital loss to offset capital gains. If you have $10,000 in long-term capital gains, applying the $2,000 loss reduces your taxable gain to $8,000, lowering your tax liability. 4. **Deduct Up to $3,000 in Losses Against Ordinary Income**: If your losses exceed your gains, you can apply up to $3,000 of the excess loss against other income, such as wages or salary. If losses still remain, they can be carried forward to future years.  **Tax-Loss Harvesting Rules to Know**  While tax-loss harvesting can be a valuable strategy, there are several rules you need to follow:  1. **The Wash-Sale Rule**: The IRS wash-sale rule prevents taxpayers from selling an investment at a loss and immediately repurchasing a ‚Äúsubstantially identical‚Äù asset within 30 days before or after the sale. This rule applies to the sale of stocks, mutual funds, and other securities. If you repurchase the same or similar asset within that window, the loss won‚Äôt be allowed for tax purposes, so it‚Äôs essential to plan carefully to avoid triggering the wash-sale rule. 2. **Offsetting Gains by Type**: Short-term losses are first applied to short-term gains, and long-term losses to long-term gains. If you have net losses in either category, they can be used to offset gains in the other category. 3. **Carrying Forward Losses**: If you have more capital losses than gains in a tax year, the IRS allows you to carry forward excess losses indefinitely. This means you can use these losses to offset gains in future years.  **When Is Tax-Loss Harvesting Most Effective?**  Tax-loss harvesting is particularly useful in several scenarios:  * **During Market Downturns**: In years where markets have declined, investors are more likely to have unrealized losses in their portfolios. Harvesting losses in a down market allows you to lock in tax savings now while potentially reinvesting in similar, more promising assets. * **Near Year-End**: Tax-loss harvesting is commonly done at the end of the tax year. This allows investors to offset gains they‚Äôve realized throughout the year and maximize potential deductions. * **High-Income Years**: If you‚Äôre in a higher tax bracket in a particular year, harvesting losses to offset gains can help mitigate a potentially higher tax burden.",I actually wrote this :(,Do you only get to harvest the loss if you sell your well performing stocks? So you can strategically sell something that has $3000 worth of of capital gains and pay no tax on those gains. Then wait 30 days and buy both the underperforming asset as well as the well performing one?,"This is my philosophy. In the long run it‚Äôs likely a wash. If I buy something at $100 then sell it at $90 to tax loss harvest. I‚Äôve essentially added $10 to my gain in the future.   Tax loss harvesting has a few places where it makes obvious sense like in a year where you have exceptionally high income and you‚Äôre trying to wipe out some gains.   But tax loss harvesting for the sake of it to me doesn‚Äôt make much sense. And the $3,000 deduction is not a strong argument.","I appreciate this write up, thank you!","Losses on your investments are first used to offset capital¬†gains¬†of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain. Were the 10k of losses carried forward ST or LT?","You don‚Äôt have to sell well-performing stocks to harvest a loss. You can harvest a loss without having any capital gains, in which case you‚Äôd have a capital loss to report. You can also sell well-performing and underperforming stocks to strategically harvest a loss to pay no tax on the capital gains, then wait 30 days and buy both assets again.","You can begin by reviewing your portfolio for underperforming assets, focusing on those trading below your purchase price. These may include stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds that haven‚Äôt met performance expectations or have recently dropped in value. Also, consider current market trends and recent volatility, as market downturns can present valuable tax-loss harvesting opportunities. Even quality assets can experience short-term dips, making this an ideal time to capture a loss while retaining the flexibility to repurchase after the 30-day wash-sale window. You may also identify investments that no longer align with your strategy or have limited recovery potential‚Äîlike companies with structural issues‚Äîwhich can be good candidates for tax-loss harvesting.","Goodness I wish they would raise that $3,000 cap on losses. It feels way too low considering that gains can be taxed up to any amount.   Thanks for post, OP. Lots of good helpful information and it was good to refresh/review as we are nearing the end of the year.","&gt; pushes capital gains and thus taxes toward future years  Better to pay tax later vs now (time value of money). For most people, taxes in retirement is lower than working years. Better yet, never sell those stocks with a high unrealized gain, pass it on to your heirs in which are the cost basis resets.","Important note: The Wash rule is actually+/- 30 days. I read ""don't rebuy within 30 days of selling"" in a few places. I wanted to sell some company stock to loss harvest and waited until I had a company stock purchase plan period. I then sold a few days later and got hit with wash rule on the number of stocks purchased."

He eventually quit brokering, got lucky and ended up with an extremely high-paying job that gave him enough money to throw away at the stock market.

investing,Nov,1gpb270,Why has the performance of ex-US equity been so abysmal post financial crisis?,"Since October of 2007, VEA (vanguard developed ex-US ETF) has a price return of -1.76%, and VWO (vanguard emerging markets ETF) has a price return of -19.19%. EM has a worse total return than cash.   So, can anyone explain why this has been the case? It‚Äôs one thing if it was a bear market to bear market situation (2000-2010 for example, the start of one bear market to the end of another).   But 17 year stretch of abysmal performance tells me that something is fundamentally broken. Do the companies not have any earnings growth? Is it just that the multiple has contracted while the earnings have grown? What‚Äôs the reason?","**1) The world has become more connected.**  The Fama French papers that initially identified international as diversification was written in the 1993. You know where the internet was back then and how globally connected the world was back then? No where near it is now.   You got a phone? Android or iPhone. Computer OS? Windows, or Mac. Business cloud? AWS, Azure, GCP.  In 1993, the Fama French papers likely didn't have the assumption that the world would become so increasingly interconnected with these megacaps  As a result the world and its equity indices are all becoming increasingly correlated. This leads to less value premium on international.  **2) Mega cap monsters, and the rise of VOO and Chill**   We are seeing the emergence of monster mega caps, and a winner take all system (or rather one that has high barriers to entry to oust the top --- no one's making a competitor to Youtube because it's prohibitively difficult).  In 2006, the Pension Protection Act, ironic for the name, but it made 401Ks opt-out rather than opt-in. They also specified QDIAs (qualified default investment plans) and most plans auto set at Target Retirement Date Funds.  These naturally skew toward equities for young investors. Prior to this institutional investors made up some 70+% of the markets. Now retail investors via VOO and Chill, the rise of passive over management ETFs and mutual funds, and 401k developments from the pension protection act you are seeing value and international diversification not being valued much.  The 401k has basically became Americas pension system at this point. And as a result of market weighting on VOO, QQQ, etc these skew toward mega cap monsters continuing to dominate   **3) US Monetary Dominance**  As mentioned in a prior comment, international diversification adds a currency overlay. US dollar strengthens versus other currencies devalues equities whose holdings are in weaker currencies.","You should always look at total returns. Otherwise you're just looking at skewed data based on how much dividends are paid. That said, they still unperformed. Developed markets haven't had as much growth as the US. Emerging not as much growth as was expected before 2008. US stocks are also in higher demand right now so they have higher valuations.",Written like a true ChatGpt but this is the correct answer but with a higher weighting going to 401k investing. If you look at Europe or any other emerging markets retail investors are on the sidelines and most investing is done by institutional investors. Retail is scared in Europe they prefer traditional saving accounts rather than take risks I guess it‚Äôs inherent to the culture as well,Just a guess (and I‚Äôm no expert at all) but maybe the strong dollar is hurting businesses that have experienced a weakening of their currency?,"\&gt;U.S. stocks‚Äô outperformance on average over the past half-century or so has simply been due to increasing price multiples, not an improvement in business fundamentals. That is, U.S. companies did not generate more profit than international companies; their stocks just got more expensive.     driven by tech companies continuing to meet absurd projections around growth though. the better part of the last decade has been this on repeat. tech companies are special in that they scale better than companies that have 'real physical products'",It‚Äôs not just tech though. It‚Äôs US having a large amount of the global multinational mega caps.,"The key factor has been productivity. Economic output is a function of labour, capital &amp; productivity (how efficiently the other two factors are utilised). If an economy can produce more with similar amount of labour &amp; capital, gains can be divided between workers and investors.   So, the question is why US productivity has been so much better vs. rest? Cause US did very well with 'digital'. Their payment networks: Visa, Mastercard. Their hotels: Hilton, Marriott (which now are essentially digital platforms). The internet/digital ads: Google, Meta. Etc. Etc.   If you look at manufacturing, US productivity is weak. So, to sum up, US has better mix of companies that are more productive/efficient.",It seems highly unlikely that the only thing driving the US outperformance is multiple expansion. The US hasn‚Äôt had a higher rate of earnings growth versus developed? EM is another thing because virtually all US capital views China as uninvestable.,"This is why I ignored all the people saying to diversify into ex-US. Nah, all the best tech is being developed right here and driving increased productivity.",Not sure what this is supposed to add to the discussion if my counterpoint is 'an average for shiller P/E is not a very good metric'  go break it down by sector. Tech is leading this HARD @ 60 shiller PE and US tech has been growing massively to take up a huge part of its indices. Yet 'tech' has been expensive for a very long time and had no issues growing into aggressive forward valuations. The most expensive sector (tech) is 3x the shiller PE of the least expensive one (financials) and around double most other sectors (in the 30 range)
investing,Nov,1gh7456,Selling a profitable stock to offset a loss and buying it back immediately ,"I can‚Äôt seem to find the answer to this question and was hoping someone here would know. I have a stock that is doing terribly and I‚Äôm going to sell it for a rather large loss. I have another stock that is doing fantastically. If I sell the stock that is doing great, I will realize a gain that is just about equal to the loss that I will experience in the stock that is terrible. Can I sell the stock that is doing well just to realize the profit so that I can write it off against the loss, and then buy the great stock  back just about immediately? I have no intention of buying the losing stock back so it won‚Äôt trigger a wash sale.","Yes you can repurchase the stock with a gain immediately, provided you have the settled funds to do so.  It's called tax gain harvesting.","wash is only for stocks you are losing on, IRS wants their money for gains immediately, but losses you can take decades to earn back they don't care.","Why not just sell to lock in the loss and carryover the excess?  $3,000 next year and hold back the $27,000 for when you actually need it?",Wash sale is for losses,"Yes you can do this.  It might not be the best use of the losses, though, especially if the stock that won is a long term hold","OP might care, if he wants to reduce taxes.  The optimal use of losses is usually *not* to offset other gains but rather to offset ordinary income. If you have a position - particularly short-term - that you want to get out of, then it probably makes sense to match gains &amp; losses like OP is doing.  But if you have some long-term holdings here and some losses there, the best idea is usually to harvest the losses and let them reduce ordinary income, while leaving the long-term holdings alone.","There‚Äôs no need for this.  Generally, this is of concern for opposite scenario.  If you were WANTING to sell a winner and avoid taxes, then you‚Äôd want to sell a loser to offset GAINS.

investing,Nov,1gy3cxf,How much now‚Ä¶ to retire later?,"How much should a 45 year old have in investments to be able to retire comfortably at 65? Right now my investment is averaging 8% over a 4 year period. I don‚Äôt plan on withdrawing until retirement. I realize comfort is subjective, but I‚Äôm new to savings/investing so a ball park would be so appreciated!!",The fact you are only averaging 8% over what has been one of the best four years of stock performance has me a bit worried. What are your investments?,Why do you have an investor? Are you having to pay any fee or commission percentage? You would have done much better just putting into something like VOO or SPY or any of the many that just track the overall market.,"I would approach this a little differently by focusing on inflation. You first need to determine what ""retire comfortably"" means, basically determining what you need for income to be comfortable; really just what you want to do in retirement, what you will have for debt, etc. Do that in today's dollars. Then apply the rate of inflation to that number. While inflation has ""averaged"" 2.5% per annum over the last 20 years, that average can be misleading and you really need to determine a personal inflation rate. Then apply that rate to your comfortable income and figure on 25 times that amount at retirement.  For example, say your ""comfortable retirement"" amount is 100K in todays dollars. At 2.5% inflation per annum that annual income requirement would be roughly 164K in 20 years and 25 times that in savings would be 4.1M. At 5% inflation per annum, a number that is more in line with my personal inflation rate, that annual income retirement would be roughly 265K in 20 years and 25 times that in savings would be 6.625M.  Those numbers may seem ridiculous today but inflation is insidious and it creeps up on you. Consider prices from 20 years ago for things like cars, movie tickets, restaurants, food, concert tickets etc. Looking at the things that I purchase, cars have increased about 3% per annum, movie tickets, restaurants and food about 5% per annum, and concert tickets more like 10% per annum. Even something like property taxes. The state I live in allows a 3% upward adjustment in taxable basis per year - and they always adjust the 3%. Even if the tax rate stays the same your inflation in property taxes is 3% a year and it's usually higher as the rate continually creeps up. That inflation rate goes dramatically higher if you sell your house and buy a new house as not only do you deal with inflation in housing prices but many if not most states reassess your taxable basis for property taxes to the new selling price.  Here is another, perhaps simpler way to look at the effect of inflation. If you figure your personal inflation rate is 3.5%, your income needs to double every 20 years to maintain the same purchasing power.  I wish it wasn't that way. I retired this year at 70. 30 years ago my brother in law and I calculated how much savings we would need in retirement to live the lifestyle we wanted to live. We tried to factor in the effect of inflation but we had a very poor grasp of what our actual inflation rate was - and no internet to use for research. For us, 30 years later, that required savings number had tripled. Part of that was changes in what was a ""comfortable retirement,"" but the overwhelming majority of it was inflation.","Fidelity guideline for US retirement:  Fidelity's guideline: Aim to save at least 1x your salary by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67.  https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire#:\~:text=Fidelity's%20guideline%3A%20Aim%20to%20save,are%20ways%20to%20catch%20up.  Another guideline is to invest at least 15% of gross, before tax, income for retirement. 8% isn't going to provide a very comfortable retirement. 15% of gross income is for starting that at an age of early 20s. You would need to invest more than 15% to catch up.  The US guidelines assume that you will get some of your retirement income from Social Security to be comfortable in retirement.

Worried I could lose my job in the next year or 2. What would my future likely look like if I used about 30k a year out of my index fund for the next 10 years before my pension kicks in? I was hoping to have money left in the index fund to supplement about 10k to the pretty small pension of 28k per year in the near future but worried using the index fund for 10 years might deplete it. I've played around with some ficalc apps and it seems possible?,A pension - you already won the game.,"Statistically yes, the math supports it.

The study showed that all-cause emergency department visits decreased by 55%, while diabetic gastroparesis-related emergency department visits reduced by 28% in patients with a prior GLP-1 history, the company said.  It added that all-cause and diabetic gastroparesis-related emergency departments were 91% and 89% lower, respectively, in patients taking GLP-1.","I think it's more likely that GLP-1 agonists spur research into new mechanisms of action that work better with fewer side effects.

Instead of mimicking hormones that make people want to eat less (which also causes them to lose muscle mass = bad for long-term immune health), we're likely to explore other ways to tackle obesity.  In the last five years, researchers have discovered half a dozen genes linked to obesity, courtesy hundreds of thousands of genomes in the UK Biobank. Humans with loss of function mutations in these genes can be protected from obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Because these are natural genotypes, recreating the effect with a genetic medicine shouldn't have very many side effects or cause loss of muscle mass.  Almost all of these genes are expressed in multiple tissue types in the body, including adipose tissue (fat cells). There aren't any therapeutic modalities that can deliver into adipose tissues in clinical trials right now, although RNA interference will start in 2025.  However, one of the genes with the most profound effect on obesity is INHBE -- and ~98% of expression occurs in the liver. If you could design the perfect obesity target for existing RNAi platforms, then it might be INHBE.  Arrowhead Pharma is about to begin a phase 1 study in obesity targeting INHBE this month (November 2024). Novo Nordisk (via its 2021 acquisition of Dicerna) will be close behind. Eli Lilly is also heavily invested in RNAi.  Short-term weight loss won't be as significant with INHBE inhibition, so comparisons to GLP-1 should be made with caution. But imagine an obesity drug that only needed to be taken 2-4x per year, didn't make you lose muscle mass, and had potentially no side effects. That's where the industry is likely to focus.",8 people on GLP-1 will split a happy meal.,Knee and hip replacement manufacturers,Weight loss drugs are appetite suppressants.

""This rapid growth name isn't trading at a 20 p/e or below, so no"" sort of mentality, which is not realistic and then people wind up avoiding growth during fantastic periods for it.

investing,Nov,1gs5g5p,Accidentally did a lump sump on former employees pension,"So I filed out the wrong box for my former employers pension pay out. I originally wanted a rollover to fidelity (my new 401k plan) but selected the lump sum box. Now I have a check for 18k wondering is it better to put it in Roth IRA or invest into my new 401k if that‚Äôs possible, or just keep the cash in my bank account",If I‚Äôm not wrong don‚Äôt you have to putt that into another account in a certain amount of time before they tax u on it ?,Cocaine‚Äôs a lot of fun,You have 60 days to put it in a IRA or 401k. You can contribute the amount withheld for taxes out of cash you have. If you don‚Äôt replace the tax amount that would still be considered a taxable withdrawal.   If you do what I said below it‚Äôs an indirect rollover and you will get a refund.,"No, they **withheld** from it already -- there's a difference.  You got three options.  * If you can make up the amount withheld, AND put the whole thing back into a traditional IRA within the time limit, it's an ""indirect non-taxable rollover"".  YOu want to put it in a Roth account, do that as a separate step and LATER. * If you keep the whole thing, the **entire amount** distributed, including the amount already withheld, will be considered taxable income. * If you deposit only the face amount on the check, the **amount withheld** will be considered taxable income.","If you keep it as a withdrawal: you‚Äôll owe income tax +% penalty if you‚Äôre under 59.5.   To avoid all/most taxes, do an ‚Äúindirect rollover‚Äù to an IRA within 60 days: - Cash the check - send the proceeds to your IRA, taking care to code it as a ‚Äúrollover‚Äù and not a ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù - since your 401k distribution has 20% withholding up front, you‚Äôll need to replace the withholding with your own funds. If you don‚Äôt have the savings to do that, whatever you don‚Äôt replace will be subject to tax/penalty.   Your 401k may or may not accept an indirect rollover; check your plan document. If not, the IRA will do.","RELAX.   And no he didn‚Äôt pay taxes, he had tax withholding. To avoid a taxable event, roll it to a Trad IRA.","Well what you could do is take it to your advisor or whoever, put it in a rollover Ira within the 60 day timeframe, tap the savings / emergency fund for the taxes they took out, and deal with it come tax time to get the tax withholding money back. This will make it non-taxable rollover for the gross and not just the net, and a little extra work on the return when you get the 1099R next year to tell the irs it was rolled over. If you roll just the net amount then it‚Äôs partially distributed and you will have tax and penalty to deal with.  If it‚Äôs pre tax money, it will need to go to a traditional ira. From there if you want it in Roth, you could convert. Seeing as to how you have withholding on it, you could work up a tax estimate on how much Roth conversion that covers since you have tax money paid in already, but just being aware of the impact on your emergency fund depletion in doing so.","It‚Äôs not interchangeable dude. Don‚Äôt lead off with ‚Äúread more‚Äù when you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.   If he has savings elsewhere he can fully fund the indirect Trad IRA rollover, and then he‚Äôll get the *withholding* back when he files.   Your scenario: taxable event. My scenario: nontaxable event.",&gt; He always paid taxes dude.  Dude there‚Äôs a difference between tax withholding and paying taxes   &gt;Coding it as Roth prevents it being income  No‚Ä¶ are you for real? Converting a pension (pretax) to Roth makes it taxable income.    &gt; If he does a traditional IRA he also has to pay the amount taken out for taxes.  No shit. But the indirect rollover will then make this completely nontaxable and OP will get the withholding back when they file.,"What are you talking about? I just acknowledged that he had tax withholding.   I‚Äôm saying to avoid the taxable event, do an indirect rollover to a Trad IRA if it‚Äôs been less than 60 days"

From 2019-2023 we averaged 1.1-1.2 million with 90k annual profit.  I‚Äôm 2024 we did 1.2 million revenue but only 35k profit. This business is not profitable this year due to increase costs. He‚Äôs only offering 150k vs the 210k I paid for it. Although we do more in sales compared to when we bought it, 2024 was less profitable.

This would give you a value and help maintain relationships with partner.,"A someone that has built and sold 3 businesses (actually just signed contracts today to sell the 3rd), there is not even close to enough info to value the business.   But, 6-12 months profit, plus your wage for the same time period would be a starting point.   If the business has lost profit, and doesn‚Äôt have more assets, it‚Äôs worth less most likely.",You can go to your nearest Small Business Development Center (there‚Äôs at one in every state) to get a valuation.,Not nearly enough information to answer that. Some small businesses aren't even profitable right away and you were profitable year 1.,"Ok, but why are you yelling?",# The answer above (Delicious_You_2370) is the correct answer.,"Impossible question to answer from the data. Looks like the partner could be tanking the business to get a lower multiple and when the deal is done will raise prices to a normal level. But if that isn‚Äôt clear to you, take whatever you think is fair and move on.","Hard to say without looking at income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows.",This spend the money on an appraisal.  A lot of it will come down to how much competition there is in the industry and if you can raise prices and still make money - or if you are taking it all out in salary etc. and that's causing the break even on the books.  If it's a store of some type how much inventory is on hand and what's the value?  If it's already been paid for and expensed off how much money is in it just to not buy any more inventory?  Sell off what's there and both of you walk away if you can't agree on a valid exit strategy?,"A good independent appraiser should be able to give a decent starting point. Financials are financials, and an appraiser should be able to consider their current market segment well enough to project something into the future. They probably can't know as much as the people actually running it... but then again, ""better than the people running it"" is not quite relevant here. It's very clear that they both disagree on the value of the business.  Without seeing the books and finding out why the drop in profitability this year happened, it's very hard to say either way. At the very least, an appraiser will give a cold ""a business with these prospects is worth x"", and that should give a good point for a better faith negotiation."

We need to disclose all of our accounts and they have to be at the approved brokerages or through my own company.      There are other restrictions too based off of what level you are at the company and what information you have access to. It ranges from having minimal access to insider info and not having to get approval for trades, but the brokerage reports every trade to your company. Then up to having access to a lot of inside info and able to influence it, which can lead to no trading allowed at all and only being allowed to invest in specific ETFs or mutual funds, could even be forced into like a blind trust where you have almost no influence over what it‚Äôs invested in.

investing,Nov,1gp74it,Ok so tariffs. What will be the impact?,"Trump ran on the tariff angle. Without getting TOO close to politics, this is largely viewed as a bad idea. Example: t-shirt company A imports from China. They buy the shirts at 10$ per shirt, the tariff has them pay 20. Obviously the company does not eat this, so they raise their sale price to counter the tariff, and the price of shirts goes up Duh. Other companies, who maybe DON'T import from China (and here is where my question is) are now given freedom to up their prices because their competitors just had to. They see the market price for shirts rise, and follow suit but without the tariff cost to them.   The question here is who benefits? What companies will be able to raise prices because their competitors were forced to...without incurring the tariff cost? I know the price of manufacture in the US is higher than it would be when outsourced to China, but there will clearly be winners here, and they wont be the tariff payers. It'll be the ones allowed to raise prices without being affected by tariffs. What business/sector will benefit from this here in the US? Again, not trolling for politically motivated responses, this is a genuine A to B question.","The tariffs themselves are only the tip of the iceberg here, just wait until the trade wars start.","Biden‚Äôs economy is doing awesome now that the pandemic inflation has ended.  He‚Äôll probably ride it for 4 years and say ‚ÄúI had the best economy,‚Äù just like he did with Obama‚Äôs.","Did people forget how we couldn't get facemasks and medical PPE during the early days of COVID?  Even though the general public might not need masks anymore, you wanna see what happens to our hospitals and medical system if China decides to not sell us PPE anymore?",I bet you companies not affected by tariffs raise prices anyway.,"And people don‚Äôt even realize that the Trump administration was literally seizing PPE from states (particularly liberal states like Washington and California) and giving it to the conservative states he liked. They also sold PPE they bought from China, as well as seized PPE, to brand new private conservative corporations for very cheap who auctioned it off to the highest bidders, maximizing profit. And they gave hospital grade covid testing to Russia when there wasn‚Äôt enough testing to go around in the US. They were profiting off of Covid; treason if you ask me.¬†  That‚Äôs a huge reason why PPE was so hard to get.","everything has at least some components made in china. There's no way the US can decouple from China, or else inflation and supply chain disruption is gonna remind us of COVID days again.",[removed],We've had this conversation so many times in the last week.  Go read the other threads.  TLDR tarrifs bad.  Trump bad.  Trump voters stupid.,Actually most clothing is imported from SE Asian and Central America these days. But I suspect people going to Walmart will be shocked at future prices soon.,"If you're looking for a silver lining, then I guess the big hope is that because the audience for this kind of thing is pretty detached from reality, the tariffs will be mostly performative, but people will go ""wow what a difference they made!"" as they give themselves permission to finally acknowledge how good the economy has been for them lately."
investing,Nov,1gv93zh,"friend just invested in spaceX via an SPV, i'm not sure i see the upside?","So my buddy calls me up telling me he just invested 35k in spaceX and asked if i was interested.  Of course I am, tell me more.  He puts me in contact with the private investment firm he used.  Now, even though i qualify as an accredited investor, I know zero of the PE space, so i did as much research as i could, but sometimes as an outsider you don't know the right questions to ask.     So far what i can tell is they purchase blocks of spacex from hedges, place them in an spv and look for accredited investors.  The SPV is holding actual shares of spaceX.  25k minimum buy in.  5% up front management fee.  No maintenance fees, or other SPV fees.  There is a premium on the spaceX shares of $175/share  (effectively sold at a $328B valuation) as opposed to the $135 ($250B Valuation) tender offer that was just announced.  They take cut of profits via a 20% carrier interest.  A provision that if starlink is spun off, they'd give 1 starlink share for every 3 shares of the spacex spv you hold.   Finally an offer of money back (minus the 5% management fee) in 5 years if spacex doesn't so public.  If i'm doing my math right, if spaceX (and starlink combined) went public and 3x'ed from an aggregate value of $250B val to a $750B val, i'd roughly double my initial investment.

investing,Nov,1h2uidc,Is there any point investing in anything other than US equities?,"US equities has always been the largest part of my portfolio (about 50-60%). I'm looking at the bizarre market though and wondering why the hell I would invest in anything else for the foreseeable? I can't remember my exact distributions, but the rest of my portfolio is more or less equally split between equities in UK, Emerging Markets, EU, Japan, Asia (excluding Japan), and I think a small portion for Africa. My thinking is that I'm investing with a 40+ year time horizon (I'm 28), and if any one of those areas sees outsized returns it could mean a lot. Likewise there's also a case of not wanting to put all my eggs in one basket.  When looking at returns the US alone is either double or triple the rest of them though, so even if the returns halved overnight they'd still be on top. Meanwhile a small downturn in the other markets could practically wipe out all their gains.  Looking at my returns in total for the last 3 years I believe I've averaged something like 13% yearly.  So should I just stay the course and ignore any potential 'lost' growth, or go all in on the US?   I'm in the UK, so currency fluctuations will be relevant here, although I'm of the opinion that GBP will continue its relative decline whilst the dollar remains strong, which further supports US equities.","Whenever ""insert stock/fund/sector"" is booming, there are always people asking why they should bother diversifying.

And past performance does not predict the future.   https://www.hartfordfunds.com/practice-management/client-conversations/investing-for-growth/us-and-international-markets-have-moved-in-cycles.html   There have been significant periods of time where international markets outperformed the US. If you aren't diversified, then when the switch happens you take 100% of the damage, and get 0% of benefits.   And then people will be asking why bother investing in US markets at all? Why not put it all in Europe, or  Asia, or whatever the hot market is at the time.   US market is a great investment. You should definitely have significant holdings in the US market. But diversity matters.","&gt; The US wasn‚Äôt as strong in the 70s and 90s as now. US is absolutely dominating right now. Why invest in 2nd or 3rd tier countries?  You could've said that in the early 70's, the US was quite the superpower back then.  &gt;Why invest in 2nd or 3rd tier countries?  There is good reason to believe that the US will underperform long term. Most of the US outperformance can be attributed to deficit spending, corporate tax cuts, and increased valuations. The US cannot continue this path of extreme deficit spending forever, and when the US ends up needing to hike corporate taxes/cut spending to cover interest on its debt, it will hurt US equities a lot.  With the exception of Japan, Italy, Greece, and Venezuela, foreign countries are a lot better in terms of debt to GDP.  &gt;Besides mega US corporations have business all around the world. You are basically investing internationally if you invest in US companies  The difference is by buying US equities, you are paying twice as much relative to earnings as international equities.",Yes. Because Bitcoin has close to zero intrinsic value. It is pure speculation. Stocks are ownership of companies. They actually have real assets and real cash that they can return as dividends. They have intellectual property and cash flows. Bitcoin has none of that.,That comment won't age well.   Maximizing expected returns is only half the battle.   It's just as important to minimize unexpected losses.,World-wide lost decade. August 2008 to present ‚Äî- VT $46 to $122. VT dropped 50% August 2008 to March 2009.

Ive put aside $500 and im thinking of putting at least $400 into VOO. Can i get any advice on what you would do if you were investing your first $500? thank you,"VOO is a good place to start. Don‚Äôt get emotional and sell if the S&amp;P goes down.  You should hold this for decades. You can consider small cap stock ETF and / or an International ETF to compliment this.  Congrats on starting early, it will give you a huge advantage.","Yeah chuck it in VOO and let it grow.  Unless you plan on making the stock market your career, there is no net benefit in sinking time into trying to pick stocks and beat the market",Dumb question but I'm kinda starting off too. How do I invest in VOO?,Spend 'em all on tacos!,"ELI5 answer: Open an account on a site like Schwab.  Transfer money into it from your bank account.  Search for VOO, it's an index fund/ETF.  Purchase shares.","You need to open either a taxable brokerage account or a retirement brokerage account like an IRA/Roth IRA/Employer Spnsored 401k. Brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Robinhood allow the purchase of VOO shares.",VOO is a fine choice.  QQQM would be a good choice.  You could even do some split between the two.,"&gt; Unless you plan on making the stock market your career, there is no net benefit in sinking time into trying to pick stocks  because it's kinda fun  $450 in VOO and $50 in individual company picks that OP likes.",Good advice üíØ - especially the part about not panic selling. Being able to stomach the downs is just as important as picking good investments.,"$400 on $VOO, $100 on $TACOS"
investing,Nov,1gwdofi,Best ETF to diversify against a decline in US equities?,"My entire portfolio is US equities (s&amp;p 500, QQQ, similar ETFs). With valuations stretched right now, I‚Äôm not saying a big drop is imminent or even likely, I just feel that investors are feeling jumpy any bad economic news (jobs, return of inflation, whatever) will have an outsized effect.   Blah blah, can‚Äôt predict the market of course, but the point of this is to figure out good options for diversifying. My top 3 ideas right now are:  - TIPS  - Corporate bonds - A consumer staples ETF (yes, still equities but theoretically should provide some resilience)  Where else should I be looking?","I put some money in CDs.   4.5% right now.  I put the interest payments into equities, but the balance is safe.  When someone says they‚Äôre going to take blowtorch to the US government, I don‚Äôt know why, that makes me nervous","If the US market crashes, the rest of the world is coming with us.","You arent diversifying, you are sucuumbing to the anxiety of investing. Essentially trying to time the market.   The correct answer is keep investing and this is why you dollar cost average into these type of funds forever.   Even if SPY crash/correct from 600 to 493, that brings us back to only Aprils level. And the last correction to 510 was so quick and out of left field that everyone who ‚Äúwent cash or hedged like you want to‚Äù just missed this entire run",In the instance that the US goes to a tariff based economy.,VXUS,"Imagine you timed the peak wrong by one week and lost 90% of your initial principal. I'll take an 8% average annualized return over educated gambling.  The smartest people in the world with the best resources available to them get paid millions of dollars a year to try and beat the market. In the long run, every single one of them fails. I'm not going to try.",Those three are good.  I‚Äôd also recommend utilities and healthcare.  Gold and high yield savings account are also good.,The incoming US administration has me a bit apprehensive in investing in healthcare as it is somewhat of an unknown as to what will happen and how it will impact the companies.,The US trades at a 27.5x multiple and international markets trade at a 13.3x multiple.  If the global economy crashes then the US has further to fall.,VT
investing,Nov,1gzmqs5,Should I open a Roth IRA?,50 y/o.  Vested in a state retirement system that will pay out 2/3 for life.  Have 40k in a stock investment account.  Wife has about 60k in a Roth IRA.  I put about $350 a month into the standard stock account.  Should I just sit on that and open a Roth for myself? Probably will retire in the next 5 years then keep working a new job (maybe part time) while collecting my retirement pension.,"Move the monthly stock money to the ROTH instead. Literally no reason not to. No capital gains tax in the ROTH. Only real downside being the $7000 annual contribution limit, which $350/month won't hit.","at 50, you're now eligible for roth ira catch-up contributions for your account. Wife's account too if she's of age.  That's an extra $1k per year per account.","That‚Äôs what I was thinking thanks. Probably just discontinue contributions to my existing account and open a new Roth. I‚Äôm told I can‚Äôt roll my current account into a Roth. Was thinking just  buying vtv, vti, or voo for the Roth.","I would open the Roth account NOW, so you can start the 5 year clock.  Assuming the ‚Äústock investment account‚Äù is a taxable brokerage account, you could sell $8k (maybe a little more to cover taxable gains) and use those proceeds to start your account.",R eally  O bvious  T roll  H acronym,"Closer you get to 59.5 the more that retirement account just looks like an account.     I'd say pre-tax contributions are better than post-tax most often for most folks,  like make some money on those differed taxes.    That calculation is about how much you have and expect to make in retirement vs. how much you are making now, and if you're already maxing the  pre-tax.  You get that limit bumped up $7k to $30k for being 50.     So the question is really one for a calculator.   Like this one:  https://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/roth_vs_traditional_401k_calculator.html?cmp=KNC-DSO-COR-Core-Retirement-NonBrand-Exact-35114-GOOG-RETIREMENT-Rothvs.Traditional401(K)Calculator-Exact-NonBrand  When you drop down to part time, or your income drops, then it might pay to slide a little into the Roth, but that depends on your overall picture for that year vs. the dreaded RMD at 72.    Personally, if I do well enough that I pay a little more in taxes when I'm 72 than I do now, that is not a bad problem to have.  Slightly sub-optimal, but patriotic.",This calculator aint it. The big trad tax savings comes from withdrawals or roth conversion up to the peak of the 12% bracket (44k) so you can defer 22+% taxes and realize them lower.,Backdoor Roth?,I am with you.  Bugs me too lol,I already know. I'm trying to get people like you to realize why you're wrong.
investing,Nov,1grkc16,Simplest logic to never pull out of the market during dips,[deleted],Scenario 5: market dips and you pull all your investments out. The market keeps going down and you buy at the low. Market recovers and hits all new time highs. You retire early because of the extra gains you made.  I don't disagree with your overall stance but like ignoring possible outcomes isn't sound logic lol.,"Scenario 5 market dips and you increase contributions and enjoy recovery, which is what I did during dip in pandemic","Scenario 6, market dips, you pull out all your investments, the market keeps dipping, market syaus in a 20 year bear market. You have loads of cash while everyone else is struggling.",Time in the market &gt; timing the market,"Scenario 6: You're never going to have enough to retire, no matter what happens.",zoom out,"I didn't say I recommend it. But you said it isn't possible, and it is.","Yeah, you left out the scenario where it keeps dropping further after you pull out, and later you buy back in cheaper, get more shares and come out ahead.","See 1929, 1974, 2000.","scenario 8: atomic war strips the land. money is valueless. the few survivors live in outposts along the equator, the only region warm enough to still grow crops. deep well water is the only irradiated source, and wars over aquifers have become your existence"
investing,Nov,1gxl07z,Can someone please explain the reason for the weakness of SEMIs right now when they're hitting record revenues?,"AMD, AVGO, QCOM, ARM, ASML all lost 7-10% in the past month. Even TSM is down 4-5%. Can't seem to find good answer online. ""Global chip sales in Q3 totaled $166B, rising 23.2% YoY and 10.4% QoQ, with the Americas leading growth once again with a 16.7% QoQ increase."" Is this because they ran up a lot earlier in the year and people just taking profits? Do we expect a strong recovery in 2025?",Nobody can ever point at something in the news and claim it explains all the behavior of the market.  2 things move the market.  Fear and greed.    The balance between them is always shifting.  Optimism is a mover. Anxiety is also a mover.,Nvidia earnings wait and see was a big factor. Now that they‚Äôre out‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt especially understand the response. I think they want Nvidia to say their next chip converts air and electricity to palladium and gold is a byproduct. Then stock price might be flat.,Maybe a reaction to imminent tariffs,"No one going to mention that semis are historically a cyclical industry?   Cyclicals tend to trade around their mid-cycle multiples. So when things are hitting records it usually means a turn in the cycle and earnings will decrease further out. Transports are a great example of this. Stocks do well at the bottom of the cycle (forward outlook is what matters at the end of the day).  So when earnings and revenues are increasing less then expected it indicates a top of the cycle and things trade down a bit.  There is a common sentiment in the market that this cycle is different and AI will enable a super cycle. This could happen and could be happening, but more evidence is needed in light of potential tariffs, returning inflation, etc.",But this should affect all companies. We have a lot of companies hitting ATH that should be affected as well.,I work with AI and I disagree. AI progress is slowing down (more computation != more capabilities/performance) but adoption will grow insanely in the next few years as pretty much all applications will start employing AI at scale. You simply can no longer compete in a business without resorting to some form of AI.,"White noise. TSM for instance is down about 7.5% from its local peak. Previously this year TSM has already been down 23+% from a local peak in the summer and has had other drops of more than 7.5% this year. These are volatile stocks. If this level of motion is outside your risk profile, then there are plenty of other alternatives.",Source of funds during a ‚Äúmarket rotation‚Äù,"Short answer (IMO) - there is some growing pessimism regarding the rate of AI expansion by researchers/analysts due to potential limitations in energy availability and the theoretical maximum capability/usefulness of current gen AI systems, causing devaluation of the near term theoretical TAM for the industry.¬†   Much of the justification for the extremely high revenue/earnings multiples in semis was driven by not just anticipated growth of AI systems and the hardware they run on, but anticipated acceleration of that growth. There's now a percolating sentiment (whether you agree with it or not) that AI may not (yet) be quite capable enough to justify the accelerating ramp up in data center capacity that was anticipated ~9 months ago.¬†   Major players in the space have been insisting for a while now that there is no foreseeable future bottleneck in AI intelligence capability, and that energy and computing infrastructure were the only bottlenecks to arbitrarily large improvements in the actual intelligence of the AI systems (almost all CEOs are still sticking to this theory). Some researchers however are now second guessing that assertion, and future energy demands have still not been resolved at the planning level, which may limit build out of AI focused data centers even if the research/results justify doing so.¬†   All that is to say that the near future (1-3 year) growth of semis may be less dramatic than expected ~ a year ago. So, while the current results show us staying on that growth curve, folks are now less optimistic about where the actual top of that curve will be, resulting in diminished enthusiasm for the correlated stocks.¬†   The next upward catalyst I'll be looking in the AI space will be release of a feature/product by openAI or other provider that demonstrates a clear and compelling value proposition for businesses to reinvigorate fervor about the potential value of AI technology. That, or if we start seeing more stories about entrepreneurs using existing AI to disrupt existing business models/industries then it may reinforce the competitive necessity of the systems, thus potentially allowing more aggressive pricing by the semi providers and higher earnings margins.","And that‚Äôs YOURE risk and comfort level. Which is totally fine. I get annoyed at ppl on this forum saying their risk tolerance, and associated strategies, are the only ones.   I can point out I‚Äôve made X dollars. Point out I‚Äôve got Y holdings. Got crypto currency water fountain on my patio.   Whatever.  But I went with MY risk profile. Is it the same as anyone else‚Äôs? No.  But damn, let‚Äôs get over the coulda woulda shoulda. You could a made a fortune. You mighta faced a huge market downturn‚Äîor will.  These are just manifestations of your own risk profile. Ppl need to stop pretending it‚Äôs gospel. That‚Äôs too many contradictory bibles."
investing,Nov,1h04w6q,"WSJ: Canada and Mexico tarrifs day 1, China tbd","There‚Äôs been a lot of threads with speculation based on campaign promises of tariffs, whether there would be follow through on these policies, and to what extent.  Today the wsj reports on announcement with additional details.  Interested in any strategies folks are planning to employ with this new information. I‚Äôm planning a shift to cash for a portion of my portfolio, but still mulling over various alternate paths.   From the article:  Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that on the first day of his presidency he will charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all products coming into the U.S. He added in a separate social-media post that he would impose an additional 10% tariff on all products that come into the U.S. from China, though he didn‚Äôt specify whether that levy would come on his first day in office.   https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-pledges-tariffs-on-mexico-canada-and-china-3c62b1f7","There is a difference between timing the market and tilting a portfolio.  The former is universally seen as a fool‚Äôs errand, the latter is what serious money does as the world stage shifts around.  I see risks that have increased in the past year, both in Europe and now in an unpredictable US administration.  If I were 30 I would ignore them.  But I am recently retired and living off the portfolio, so things that increase sequence risk have my full attention.   All that said, I am tilting the portfolio to be more conservative, and will be making my already existing bond tent steeper.  I will probably use traditional Treasuries out to 2028, then TIPS (the actual bonds, not funds) for 2029-2033.  I hold my bonds to maturity.  My cash allocation will remain stable at 5%.  For what it is worth.","You have to decide whether you want to speculate on macro or not.   If you do, then you should be much more ambitious than ‚Äùmoving partially to cash because of tariffs‚Äù. If you are not speculating on macro, which should be most people, then you shouldn‚Äôt change your portfolio because of tariffs.","No need to speculate‚Ä¶ timing the market has never been an effective long-term strategy. If you have a well diversified portfolio, these tariffs (if they do happen) shouldn‚Äôt cause you to veer from your current strategy",Wallstreetbets in shambles on their new trump tweets,"Which is interesting, because this same thing happened last time during Trump's presidency. Mexico agreed to beef up security and Trump dropped the tariffs a week later.  I assume this is the same tactic.","VOO has always been sufficiently diversified against idiosyncratic risks, but never diversified past that. Inclusion of all caps, international stocks, and (possibly) bonds is essential to having a fully diversified portfolio regardless of current market conditions",&gt;  timing the market has never been an effective long-term strategy.  Joe Kennedy famously got out of the market during the summer of 1929 after a shoeshine boy offered him stock tips.,"I don't go full VT, but I do 80% VOO and 20% VXUS so I'm well diversified against pretty much anything.",Index funds: currently not planning to sell unless tariffs are massive or as widespread as he‚Äôs saying  Individual stocks:  - trimmed shares of stocks with heavy China exposure  - decreased ‚Äúunprofitable‚Äù stock bets  Other: - increased exposure to hard assets and alternatives,"What if I only buy VOO? Under these new conditions will this still be considered diversified , as its 100% focused on US market?"
investing,Nov,1gxdhv9,What do you guys think of target stock? (TGT),"They had a bad quarter and they just dropped 20%, but there's that old saying about buying when others are fearful, or buying good companies when theyre down. I believe they'll bounce back from the bad quarter.   Anyways, theyre currently trading around $124.40, their average price target is $143. Their P/E (according to google) is 13.17 whereas the Consumer descretionary sector P/E average is ~28 according to this: https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/sector/consumer-discretionary/  They just seem like a good company that had a bad quarter.  Anyways the numbers look good to me but I'm a novice at best when it comes to stock investing.  So am i missing something? Do you all think it's a good time to get in for the medium to long term?","More bad quarters to come. Prices too high, consumers are switching to walmart and aldi. If inflation appears again (likely), no TGT gains.",It will probably bounce back eventually. The upper middle class is growing long term and Target seems primed to keep that demographic and grow it. Right now I think people are taking a deep breath after the pandemic boom and inflation. No one knows how long this will last and if it will get worse.,Wait since when is Target the prime shopping location for upper middle class?,"Dunno that i would lump aldi in as a competitor, but i understand the walmart concern","Aldi opened underneath a Target in my neighborhood in D.C. Their food is substantially cheaper. Not to mention, I have much more faith in perishables purchased at Aldi versus the ones sitting in Target.",Target fumbled the shipt acquisition. Should‚Äôve cornered the market with that buy. Customers leaving in droves and management is trash. No one knows what‚Äôs next but it doesn‚Äôt look good. Just got buy a retailer like COST which is executing quarter after quarter despite looking expensive price wise.,"Aldi focuses on food while Target has a much wider variety of goods - clothes, housewares, office supplies, tools, electronics, etc etc - I wouldn't compare Aldi to Target at all.",I didn't say it was their prime shopping location. I just think Target is positioned to grow with the demos who are moving up into higher income situations. I obviously could be wrong.,"So revenues increased slightly after they cut prices, but profit margin fell quite a bit. More tickets but less profit. Consumer bit on price cuts but didn‚Äôt purchase many of their higher margin products. CEO said it himself, and analysts agree - their consumer is stretched. They also forecasted a weak period during what should be their highest rev/profit quarter. With the added risk of inflation rising due to new government, I think this company has another leg down before it recovers.    Though it will recover. Fundamentally a good business + their app and rewards program isn‚Äôt half bad. People on here saying Aldi is a direct competitor are just wrong. Nobody just goes to target for groceries alone. They go for all the reasons folks go to Walmart, only they have more to spend. Just not at the moment.","I don't know that I've ever met anyone who goes to target specifically for groceries, i see their groceries as more of a convenience.    Someone goes there for apparel and grabs groceries because they're convenient while they're there. I don't see aldi as a competitor nor do i believe aldi is even in all the markets that target is."
investing,Nov,1gyjrb7,Renting vs Buying a house ,"I live in a super HCOL area where I won't be buying anything even average with my income.  If I have enough money make a down payment of 150k and that's my entire stock portfolio, would it be a smarter move to just rent an apartment and let my stocks grow? Long term even?","NYT has a rent vs buy calc  even in MCOL areas the unrecoverables of owning (ie, amortized repairs, interest on loan, taxes) right now often exceed renting by a significant margin to where owning only makes sense (strictly financially speaking) in the medium term. VHCOL it is pretty much pushing 'never.' It is insane how little equity on your mortgage payment you get with a 7.5% loan compared to a 3% loan.","You can‚Äôt forget the benefit of leverage when you buy. 100k in the stock market would be similar to 500k in the housing market assuming 20% down. Where will that 100k and 500k be, respectively, in 10 years. You can back test scenarios, of course. But rent vs. own discussions usually don‚Äôt properly factor in leverage. Of course, if you own you then deduct interest, repairs, property taxes, and transfer taxes. Finally, never forget the difference in capital gains treatment between the stock market and your particular portfolio and selling your primary residence. Capital gains treatment and leverage are the biggest financial benefits of owning, which may offset the lower appreciation of real estate compared to the stock market.","Buy a house because you want a house and you can afford it.   I bought 10 years ago at a dirt cheap rate in a hot PNW market. Renting + investing the delta would have had me come out 100k+ ahead of the current value of my house, which has more than doubled. Maintenance costs are a bitch.   Buying a house is a lifestyle choice more than anything, IMO.","I see this argument a lot, rent vs buying and the interest rates are always the main reason people buy or don't buy.  Imo the problem is people think they're going to pay the same interest rates for the life of the loan, this is incorrect, many mortgage owners refinance which is never calculated.   Also rents *ALWAYS* go up, mortgages stay the same price or get cheaper when refinancing","Betting on interest rates going down can be a risky proposition. People were buying in 2022 expecting interest rates to come down significantly in 2 years, but mortgage interest rates are still quite high and haven‚Äôt moved significantly even with the fed cutting  federal funds rates.   There‚Äôs two problems with relying on refinancing:  1) Refinancing itself has fees and costs associated  2) The first few years of a mortgage are primarily interest payments. If rates take longer to drop than you expect, you may have been paying primarily interest rather than towards principle. Using an [amortization calculator](https://www.calculator.net/amortization-calculator.html?cloanamount=600%2C000&amp;cloanterm=30&amp;cloantermmonth=0&amp;cinterestrate=7&amp;cstartmonth=11&amp;cstartyear=2024&amp;cexma=0&amp;cexmsm=11&amp;cexmsy=2024&amp;cexya=0&amp;cexysm=11&amp;cexysy=2024&amp;cexoa=0&amp;cexosm=11&amp;cexosy=2024&amp;caot=0&amp;xa1=0&amp;xm1=11&amp;xy1=2024&amp;xa2=0&amp;xm2=11&amp;xy2=2024&amp;xa3=0&amp;xm3=11&amp;xy3=2024&amp;xa4=0&amp;xm4=11&amp;xy4=2024&amp;xa5=0&amp;xm5=11&amp;xy5=2024&amp;xa6=0&amp;xm6=11&amp;xy6=2024&amp;xa7=0&amp;xm7=11&amp;xy7=2024&amp;xa8=0&amp;xm8=11&amp;xy8=2024&amp;xa9=0&amp;xm9=11&amp;xy9=2024&amp;xa10=0&amp;xm10=11&amp;xy10=2024&amp;printit=0&amp;x=Calculate#calresult), if it takes 10 years for interest rates to drop and you have a $600k/30Y/7% mortgage, you‚Äôll have paid $400k in interest and less than $70k towards your principle.  So, now you‚Äôre betting on price appreciation *and* interest rates dropping in a short enough time frame. It can work if we experience historically low interest rates again, but it‚Äôs definitely a gamble.","Everyone I know that bought 10+ years ago is happy, even if it was a bad deal back then with low downpayment and mortgage insurance.  They are paying WAY LESS for that mortgage then current rent, because rent always goes up.  Up up up up up.   Getting out of the rent inflation cycle is worth a lot.","Tldr; you can calculate the difference of renting vs buying, but have to consider all associated variables to end up with a realistic comparative results.","Generally?  Yeah, renting better.  Markets tend to outperform property BY A LOT in terms of returns.  You do get the benefit of leverage with property, but you also get mortgage interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and maintenance too.    Plus it's not always an apples-to-apples comparison.  I can sign a lease for some run-down one bedroom apartment for a year, but that doesn't mean I'd be okay with buying it.    It also depends on whether you've got the discipline to save...  One of the benefits of buying a house for normies is it functionally forces them to save.  And since saving is very important, it works out.  But if you're really good at saving money without being forced to by a mortgage, you'll probably come out ahead. by renting.  All that said, real estate is extremely location dependent, so there's not much for it but to crunch the numbers, make some guesses, make some good/bad/middle estimates.    TL;DR:  Rent a relative shithole, save money like a madman.  Probably.","This is a vast oversimplification and why the rent vs buy calculator exists. The alternative to buying is renting *and putting the money you don‚Äôt spend on buying a house into alternative investments.*   While rents rise, so do the investments. At a certain point, your investments and their increasing value will can pay for rent.   You‚Äôre borrowing money to bet on red (mortgage) when black is playing slots instead of roulette.","&gt;Also rents ALWAYS go up  That isn't true though. Rent is driven by supply and demand, and if supply increases or demand decreases then rents will drop as vacancy rises.  I am currently in a hcol market where home prices have continued to rise, but rental prices have been falling."
investing,Nov,1gh73tb,ASML: An unbeatable monopoly?,"After ASML‚Äôs Q3 results publication, the stock declined by a stunning 20%. This market reaction was mainly due to the revised outlook and shrinking order book. The semiconductor market can be very cyclical in the short term, but is driven by many long-term growth trends. In this article, we‚Äôll explain why ASML is likely to stay on top in its league and why it‚Äôs so difficult to replicate ASML.  [ASML engineers working on one part of a machine](https://preview.redd.it/zbnjr6u2yayd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7585c012e7baf4111a23a9d0345fb34574023d8b)  Let‚Äôs explain ASML first, in case you don‚Äôt know the company. ASML is the worldwide leader in lithography systems, capturing more than 90% of the market. Simply put, lithography is the process of projecting patterns on silicon wafers; a crucial and complex step in making advanced semiconductors. ASML‚Äôs customers are chip manufacturing companies like TSMC, Samsung, Intel and SK Hynix.  You can distinguish two types of lithography machines. The first one is DUV (Deep Ultra Violet), used for making less advanced chips. The second one is EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet). This last technology has been fully operational since 2020 and can be used for making the world‚Äôs most advanced chips. This enables customers to produce chips with transistors of only 2-3 nanometer (one-billionth of a meter).  **1. ASML‚Äôs long-term vision and development pipeline are unmatched**. ASML started researching EUV technology in 1990, which means it took around 30 years to develop this technology to its maximum potential. You might think: *‚ÄúWell, aren‚Äôt competitors working on the same thing?‚Äù* They tried, but they failed. Companies like Nikon and Canon halted substantial investments in EUV technology because of the large gap with ASML and the struggles they experienced. What about DUV, the less complex technology? In that area, ASML has a market share of around 80%. The yield that ASML‚Äôs lithography machines realize for its clients is unparalleled. China bought a DUV system, installed it at a main university and tried to rebuild it. Unfortunately, even with all the parts there and reverse-engineering it, they couldn‚Äôt make it work again.  We hope we made ASML‚Äôs lead clear with these statements. What‚Äôs even more impressive, is that ASML already installed its first High-NA EUV machine at Intel. This system is capable of printing 1.7x smaller transistors and achieve a 2.7x higher density compared to the NXE (first EUV) machines. And to really show ASML‚Äôs long-term perspective; they are already working on the next generation (Hyper-NA).  [ASML roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/ti1s6bx4yayd1.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9c4524acc1cfe72edb9f71708d6ea98cc73b007)  **2. ASML holds more than 16.000 patents for its machines, not even counting those held by ASML's exclusive suppliers.** These must be respected internationally. Additionally, there is a significant knowledge advantage over competitors that cannot be easily overcome. Switching from ASML requires a total change in operation, as their machines are precisely tailored to customer needs, including personalized on-site support. ASML continuously offers maintenance and adjustments to their machines to prevent downtime, which is essential given the high costs of failure. Therefore, a switch to another supplier would be gradual and complex due to the deep integration and customization that ASML provides.  [ASML patents](https://preview.redd.it/6z6x69dbyayd1.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f993999fe98bf9ab85db0c16446dd899388df47)  **3. ASML‚Äôs supplier network is inimitable.** The biggest competitive advantage following former CEO Peter Wennink is the central role ASML plays within the ecosystem. Cooperation, transparency, and trust are critical factors, especially because of the high dependency upon one another. ASML has a supplier base of over 5.100, mainly from The Netherlands and Germany. The parts of these suppliers must be seamlessly integrated with each other to create a lithography machine. Without any of these parts, the machine wouldn‚Äôt be able to operate. Some of these critical suppliers, like Cymer, Trumpf and Carl Zeiss SMT, are already (partly) owned by ASML.

investing,Dec,1hk2shm,To all the youngsters: I (57M) was once where you are. Slow and steady wins the race. ,"Forget crypto, options, stock picking and other exotic strategies. Dollar-cost averaging into low cost mutual funds for 31 years has resulted in a nest egg I never imagined.  I had saved about $10,000 a couple years after I graduated college. My first job paid $16/hour (both in 2024 dollars). I read the Wall Street Journal Guide to Personal Finance and began saving and a small portion of my paycheck (10%) in mutual funds.  The formula has remained the same. From that initial $10K we're now sitting on a $3.3M nest egg. All 4 kids had their education paid for (state schools) and are adulting with no debt.  I remember thinking years ago, when I was their age, my account was $60K, that ""I hope these 8-10% annual growth projections come true"" and they have in spades. The market was roaring in the 1990s and like today plenty predicted future doom and gloom.  As I've gotten older, my salary has increased as well as my savings rate (about 40% over the last 7-8 years). Of course none of this would have been possible with the giant market gains of the last few years.  But that's why you DCA and don't get swept up in the news of the day. There's simply no substitute for time in the market, and lost time can't be recouped.

Man, those first few years were brutal - watching $50 contributions barely move the needle. Was tempted to give up so many times, especially since I was only making $35k at my first real job.  Started at age 28 with just the minimum to get company match (3%). Parents never taught me about investing, so I had to learn everything myself. Now at 40, just hit $300k and it's growing way faster than before. Still not where I should be, but the compound interest is finally kicking in.  Just wanted to share for anyone feeling discouraged early on. Keep putting money in, even if it feels pointless.

investing,Dec,1hl3xhl,My father's wisdom literally saved me and made huge profit.,"I‚Äôm a foreigner investing in U.S. stocks. Three years ago, I wanted to inherit some money from my father to help with my wedding and buying a house. I thought I could grow the money by investing it in U.S. stocks if I inherited it in advance. So, I asked my father if he could give me $50,000. After some thought, he agreed. My plan was to invest the entire $50,000 all at once in EV companies like Lucid, Tesla, and Rivian because I made some profit through Lucid stock at that time. This was back in November 2021, when the market was ATH.  However, my father had doubts and worries. Instead of giving me 50k, he decided to send the money in installments over 10 months. Every month, he transferred $5,000 to my account, but perhaps because he was still anxious, he split each transfer into $2,500 on the 1st and another $2,500 on the 15th of the month. I was frustrated because I wanted to invest all the money at once, but I had no choice but to follow his decision.  Then, in early 2022, when my father began sending the money, the market suddenly started to decline. The Ukraine war broke out in February, and a series of negative factors caused the downturn to continue throughout the year. I ended up buying big tech stocks on the 1st and 15th of every month. In a way, I was forced to do dollar-cost averaging (DCA). The stocks I invested in during that time were big techs such as Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.  Two years later, those investments have grown significantly, reaching $150,000 in value. Nvidia, in particular, delivered an astonishing return of over 700% (from $10,000 to $80,000). On the other hand, the Lucid stock I had bought with my own money before November 2021 is now down 90%, leaving me with a $20,000 loss. If my father had given me the $50,000 all at once and I had invested it in EV stocks, I‚Äôd probably still be in a deep loss.  Honestly, I think I was more fortunate than skillful. This experience taught me firsthand how powerful DCA can be and importance of diversification. I really wanted to share this story with you all. Thanks.",That‚Äôs the wrong takeaway.   If you had lump summed 50k into NVDA it would be worth about $250k today.  Lucid would be worth about $5k today.  The lesson you learned was diversification.,"""I decided to inherit some money from my father""  Poor people hate this one simple trick.","Dude talks about diversification but simply threw his money at the biggest names in tech.

They looked like they had tons of money - think sailboat, nice car every few years, etc.  Now they have just barely enough to survive.  Another relative has always looked lower middle class.

It started down the path of understanding how low price debt (like my 2.25% mortgage for instance) can be utilized to increase your wealth. As long as you can get a return for more than you borrow, you're making money. So why would you pay off a 2.75% loan when you could make 10% per year on that money?

We occasionally get someone on reddit investment subs that asks about taking out a 10 or 20k loan to invest (maybe with a low promo rate). More than likely they don't already have that money. So, if something goes wrong, they're not likely able to pay off their debt.   The reason the calculation works on a 2.25% mortgage is because the individual has more than enough money to pay the mortgage, living expenses, maintenance, and have leftover money to invest.   When you have way more money than you need to live, it starts making sense to borrow money and use that money to make money.

There's more context in my previous updates linked below.  **Previous updates:**  * [1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) * [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) * [2 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)  # Progress updates  Below are the returns for this portfolio (opened in 2022) as of December 2024.  # Realized (sold) in 2023  * **Affirm (AFRM):**¬†\+18.09% * **Allbirds (BIRD):**¬†\+6.89% * **Coinbase (COIN):**¬†\+6.42% * **Carvana (CVNA):**¬†\+845.57% * **Meta (META):**¬†\+256.36% * **Cloudflare (NET):**¬†\+50.67% * **Netflix (NFLX):**¬†\+122.39% * **Peloton (PTON):**¬†\-71.51% * **Roblox (RBLX):**¬†\+25.57% * **Shopify (SHOP):**¬†\+51.27% * **Snapchat (SNAP):**¬†\-1.99% * **Unity (U):**¬†\+27.57%  See the¬†[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)¬†for comments.  # Realized (sold) in 2024  * **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):**¬†\-18.69%¬†(\*) * **Amazon (AMZN):**¬†\+97.41% * **Alphabet/Google (GOOGL):**¬†\+75.05% * **Apple (AAPL):**¬†\+8.77%¬†(\*) * **ARM (ARM):**¬†\+10.52%¬†(\*) * **ASML (ASML):**¬†\-7.40%¬†(\*) * **Intel (INTC):**¬†\-20.12%¬†(\*) * **Microsoft (MSFT):**¬†\+4.53%¬†(\*) * **Netflix (NFLX):**¬†\+361.74% * **Palantir (PLTR):**¬†\+65.72%¬†(\*) * **Roblox (RBLX):**¬†\+42.66% * **Shopify (SHOP):**¬†\+86.96% * **Snowflake (SNOW):**¬†\+51.57% * **Super Micro Computer (SMCI):**¬†\+14.48%¬†(\*) * **Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM):**¬†\+103.19% * **Tesla (TSLA):**¬†\+92.16%¬†(\*) * **Unity (U):**¬†\-8.73%  (*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for &lt;1yr*  I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).  So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.  In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.  To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.  Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.  # Unrealized (current investments)  * **Meta (META):**¬†\+367.97% * **Nvidia (NVDA):**¬†\+117.05%  Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after¬†dithering for months.  These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.  # Rate of return (IRR)  My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is¬†**73.6%**.  # Investment thesis  See a summary of my investment thesis in a¬†[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).¬†**TL;DR:**  &gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.      The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn‚Äôt make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it‚Äôs the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what‚Äôs coming thanks to NVIDIA‚Äôs CUDA (moat), among¬†[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).‚Äù      \- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023    # Nvidia's dominance  I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:  * Nvidia is¬†[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)¬†and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies. * It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage. * This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy. * AI will consistently make software¬†easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now). * Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.  # We still underestimate the AI opportunity  Most importantly, we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of AI‚Äôs opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.  We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.  # Final thoughts  I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)¬†I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I‚Äôm still benefiting from.  I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.",My total rate of return for 2022 to 2024 is 96% doing nothing but buying QQQ,For reference the S&amp;P was up 52% in the same period (w/dividends reinvested).,This. Bro is out here with a manifesto during/after a crazy bull run where you can pretty much buy anything and isn't even outperforming the index.,"Yes, indexes like S&amp;P 500 had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024), but IRR is different. For apples to apples, the IRR (annualized) of the S&amp;P 500 during this period was \~16%.","Mag7 have done super well over that time period, so yeah.   But OP had 73 percent annual return for each of the 2.5 years, which is a lot higher than 96 percent.","Yes, indexes like QQQ and S&amp;P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). But for an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&amp;P 500 respectively during this period were \~16% and \~24% compared to \~73% for mine.  I believe the error is u/rcbjfdhjjhfd states 'total rate of return' but confuses total return with rate of return (IRR).",For whatever reason i decided to put everything into Peloton around that time.  Needless to say I dont buy stocks anymore,Yeah people are confusing your 73% rate of return with total return,What data points make you think AI has more to offer than incremental improvements over where we are at today?,"I work at the #1 cloud provider in the AI industry with leading AI research firms and I think we are hitting the limits of the transformer architecture. New model benchmarks (e.g., Amazon Nova) are providing marginal improvements at best while pre-training and fine tuning costs remain very high (multiple millions for just fine-tuning). The underlying technical limitation of the architecture will limit the apps built on top (video gen, autonomous agents, etc.). If all the economy gets for this investment are copilots and customer service chatbots, then that is valuable but not a game-changer."
investing,Dec,1hdrpfa,All QQQ holders now have BTC exposure via MSTR,"‚ÄúOn Nov. 29, the day when the Nasdaq took a market snapshot in preparation for the index's annual rebalancing, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $92 billion. That would rank the Michael Saylor-led company as the 40th largest in the Nasdaq 100 and a likely weighting in the index of 0.47%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.‚Äù",ETF normies are going to profit off of bitcoin whether they like it or not,"That's the point of being an ETF normie. If something proves value, it'll end up in the index. If it doesn't, it won't.",You pissed a lot of people offü§£ü§£,"This is not a good thing.  This is like when CDOs are being held by the big banks across Wall Street.  Crypto infecting the Nasdaq, QQQ etc is setting us up for the crypto crash to take the markets down with it.",[deleted],"We've gone from ""Institutions will *never* buy Bitcoin"" FUD to ""Institutions will buy too *much* Bitcoin"" FUD. lol",QQQ(M) holders already had bitcoin exposure through other companies like Tesla which has ~1 billion in Bitcoin holding albeit MSTR increases that some.,"Shit, I need to buy MSTR after these comments.",You don't think people are investing in Tesla because of what's on their balance sheet? No idea why you're in an investing sub if you don't think a company's holdings (that literally increase the company's value when it goes up and decreases the company's value when it goes down) are important. Maybe not the average investor but idk how you think the stock market works if you don't think algos and hedge funds aren't factoring that into their equations to buy or sell,I was all anti crypto until 2020.  Now I read this threads exactly how I used to think.  Feels good reading all this cope.
investing,Dec,1hbu2gt,What is stopping me from becoming a financial advisor and only investing in VOO or VTI?,"Not too serious of a question, but like people say 99% of people don't out perform the market. Then what would stop me from financially advising people to invest in VOO or VTI and charge them for my ""service"".     I understand that people at different stages of live have different risk tolerances, but I think up until retirement you're probably safe to only have one of these ETFs.      I know of some financial advisors that are lagging behind the market this year, plus they charging a fee for their ""investment knowledge"". I think its ridiculous, let me know what you think.","My dad passed away 3 years ago, he had a financial advisor with an office at a local shopping center (I know). He always told me that Marlon knows the market, Marlon has my back, Marlon never leads me wrong.  Then he died. I saw the paperwork. 100% VTI. God knows how much Marlon made in service fees all those years.",See Marlon is a smart man.,He knew the market. He had his back.¬† There is some truth to that.¬† He wasn't effing around with a client's money.,"I‚Äôve done well enough in the market this year that several people close to me asked if they could give me money for me to invest and I‚Äôd make a fee. They‚Äôre people I‚Äôd trust with my life, so that isn‚Äôt the issue.   My response was always fuck no, because it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs your mother, they‚Äôll sue you if you lose their money lol.","The reason is that financial advisers do a lot more than just manage a  portfolio. People that use a financial adviser are seeking services on tax optimization,  reduced volatility if they are drawing down, estate planning, UMH asset  management services,  etc.  etc. etc.   There's a ton of common misunderstanding on Reddit about what financial advisers actually do for their clients.   For anyone that just wants to be in an  all equity fund - there's zero reason to  use a financial adviser.","Marlon protected your dad from himself.  I had the 3 bucket portfolio conversation with my inlaws, I explained how advisors don't beat the market.  Didn't matter.  They still went with their buddy at Edward jones.  At the end of the day I let it lay.  They'll get worse returns and lose money to fees, but the more I spoke to them the more I realized they'd probably panic sell at the bottom.","This. There are lots of ""bros"", grifters, and unscrupulous types in finance. The advisor space is no exception.   I'd say Marlon is better than most? 100% VTI certainly is better than underperforming mix of random etfs/funds/bonds, inflexible mutual funds with high fees PLUS underperformance, or whatever other shit the lower half of FAs use. Not even talking about the fraud or outright scammers.   Being a FA isn't just management of the funds but also management of the client. It doesn't sound good on paper, but honestly a big part of being a good financial advisor or fiduciary is how well you work with your client? Knowing their goals, personality, risk tolerance, current &amp; future income/expenses, timeline, and estate plans. Sometimes being an FA/F is about making sure your clients have no worries or talking your clients out of bad decisions (investing in bubbles, selling at bottoms, pulling everything out to put it into pregnantbutt crypto coin, etcetc) rather than fundamental analysis, technical charts, and maximizing returns while targeting a specific Sharpe ratio.  If the dad didn't understand finance/investing, but felt Marlon was a trustworthy guy who not only managed his money well AND made him feel just right? Then it was a good choice for the dad. Not sure what Marlon did, but he probably also advised the dad more than once. Just in case folks think I'm talking the FA/F book, I don't work in finance (I'm in physical goods wholesale) nor do I feel a need for an FA myself as I'm trained in economics, enjoy following economics/finance/markest, and LIKE managing my own finances. The average r/investing or r/boglehead redditor isn't the same as the average person. Most folks would just like to not worry about their money, not have to manage their finances, and enjoy more time with their family.","Financial planner here.  Never once have I promised any client that I can beat the market.  If someone tells me that‚Äôs their goal and the standard they‚Äôll hold me to, I decline the business.  My efforts focus on accumulation/distribution strategy, tax &amp; estate planning, and helping people keep things in perspective whether the markets are good or bad.",Just more evidence that Marlon knew.,Same. I couldn‚Äôt sleep at night if I lost someone else‚Äôs money
investing,Dec,1h71ibh,Does this time remind you of the dot-com era?,"Man, I have to say living through that time in the late 90's where everyone and their grandmother were giving you tech stock advice was a surreal time. I was new to the industry, but it was hitting this fever pitch where hard working everyday folks were moving all of their hard earned life savings into 100% dot com stocks - just dreaming to strike it rich like all their friends. I could only imagine the conversations that followed with their loved ones, when the entire market dropped out from under them. I wanted so much to say ""I told you so"" ... but was honestly too heartbroken for them.  Fast forward to today. Even with Bitcoin/Crypto's use case being very compelling ... I can't help but to get flash backs of the dot-com era. This euphoria has occurred before, and I hate to think that history will repeat itself again (which it more than likely would, as I'm hearing people talk and act the same way).  There's no question these are exciting times, but can't help but to have PTSD ... with visions of people losing the shirt off their backs. Anyone else lived through that time and feel the same way?","I don't think anything in my lifetime will ever again capture the ambient euphoria of that era. Turn of the century, pre-9/11, people really sincerely believed the sky was the limit.  It's far more cynical this time around. People now believe the idiocy of the Greater Fool is unlimited.","No, not even close. NVDA would have to 4x in price to be the same PE valuation as CSCO. We are way below the dot com bubble territory",Buy more NVDA? Got it!,Not even remotely.   The dot com era was a bunch of companies that weren‚Äôt making any money. Companies today are making a lot of money to back up their prices.,I heard it could 4x from here,"I wouldn't say this is as euphoric as 2021.   I wasn't quite old enough to be of age to be investing during dotcom, but I wouldn't say this or 2021 is the mania that dotcom seemed, from my understanding.   Dotcom was absolutely bonkers, many companies reached all time highs that they still haven't beaten to this day, maybe even adjusting for inflation as well. As others have said, companies making absolutely nothing and simply having a website exist were going public and their stock was skyrocketing. Many of the massive tech giants we know today took nearly a decade to recover to their dotcom peak.   However, dotcom was largely concentrated to a specific new, emerging industry. It impacted the broader markets when I looked at it historically but it wasn't like in 08' when everything crashed hard across the board. Again, from what it recall.   2021 I did live through, that was market wide euphoria. The IPO/SPAC market was insane and everyone and everything was trying to go public. I bet you would struggle to buy a single stock that wasn't trending upward with some stocks or industries just going parabolic. We were basically at zero interest rates, the government was printing money, consumer bank accounts were flush from the pandemic, everyone was off work or working from home (bored and ""investing"" or day trading) and things like GME or Bitcoin were drawing in retail investors that otherwise, probably would never touch the stock market.   This current bubble is largely more justified (although still expensive) because companies are still making tons of money and driving their market cap up. The AI sector is similarish to a Dotcom type situation due to the condensation and potential to ""change society"" like the internet did. My guess is that it will¬†likely burn out the same way IE AI will change some aspects of our society in crazy and unexpected ways and only a few winners will actually be winners and end up surviving and thriving - the rest will be bankrupt or acquired for pennies on the dollar and burn out. I think the rest of the market will feel minor pain in comparison, maybe a little 5-10% dip if the AI bubble pops.   We're in a situation of recovery from the pandemic still IMO. The 2020 drop and pain and the 2021 ""recovery"" and bubble bursted. We've had 3 years of fairly poor IPO markets in a row. The wheat has gotten separated and the profitable viable companies have survived and those that depended on zero interest rates to continue their¬† existence or inflate their valuation have burned out, gone bankrupt, been acquired for pennies on the dollar, or majorly downsized.   Retail investors, as always IMO, are way too early and calling something we may not see for years. We're going to see a lot of action, IPO's and market movement upwards before we see a major turnaround. Inflation is almost tamed, unemployment is fairly low, the US economy is fairly strong, and the Fed has seemingly successfully navigated and delivered on a ""soft landing"".   Lastly, years of high inflation need to be factored into the all time highs for comparison.¬†Years of inflation rates need to be compounded and compared to the historical highs for an inflation-adjusted perspective into where we are at. Are we really in bubble territory from all time highs years ago?",This feels like 2021.  Everything parabolic in the last month especially. Shitcos with near vertical lines up.  I'm invrsted but with a lot of cash on the sidelines. Not going to chase euphoria.  I've seen it before and it always ends the same.,"I loved the concept of a private and decentralized currency. Unfortunately it's not really either of those things. Transactions take forever and are expensive. It's not private if the government really wants to trace it. It's a mainstream investment vehicle now, and nothing else. It consumes massive amounts of electricity, contributes greatly to environmental pollution, and serves no purpose outside of speculative investing. We've all known for a very long time that BTC is a good investment, but I don't invest in things I disagree with.   Anyways, yes people will get burnt. People have already been burnt. There are always people who will invest too much when the price is too high, and then sell when it craters. BTC has cratered multiple times. There are also lots of people who have made vast fortunes with BTC. Good for them. I wish I had. But again, I don't invest in things I disagree with, which puts me at a significant disadvantage, because I disagree with a lot of things.","Nividia is not the entire market though. The stock market is now valued two standard deviations above the trend line, which has only happened twice before in the last 100 years. We‚Äôre due for a major price correction.",If there were a legitimate use for Bitcoin it would have been figured out over the past 15 years

Al has similarities to the internet of the late 1990s, and the bubble's burst is only a matter of time. If Trump fulfills his campaign promises, it may bring a brief prosperity to the U.S. stock market, but it will also fuel the bubble, leading to a major depression.

investing,Dec,1hpte8o,How to ‚Äúlive off interest‚Äù ,"I often hear about people who sell a company or get an inheritance who live off of the interest of their money without touching the principal amount. Obviously this sounds simple but what does it really look like.   Say you get 10 million post tax. I understand that you would invest it and live off of a number below the return. If the market is giving average 8% you live off of 3%. (Yes I know this year the return has been much higher, just giving numbers as an example) But what does this really look like. Is it as simple as giving your money to a firm like Schwab they handle it all, take a percent, and you get monthly deposits.    On the flip side how would you do this without a 3rd party?   Obviously I‚Äôm not loaded but this has always intrigued me, thank you in advance for the answers!",There is no need to have a third party.  You can do it yourself.  Own a diversified portolio of stocks (likely index funds) and bonds.  Collect the interest.  If you need more then sell a portion of the shares.  Note that if the shares go up 7% and you sell 2% you are still coming out ahead.,it helps to have a couple mil,"Since no one actually gave actual examples, i'll give you one. I recently FIREd 3 years ago so what i've been doing is the following. I have all my investments in ETFs, mainly VTI/VOO. I need about $60k per year.

I pay pre-pay all my taxes, put the money into cash-quivalent (MMF) and every few months I transfer a few thousands from my brokerage to my checking account.",This is the best answer but the goal FIRE planning is to not run out of money before you die rather than preserving principle.

Also important to point out for FI/RE that they have to factor in healthcare costs before retirement.

My partner has no dependents and wasn't a FI/RE person but was laid off earlier than 60yo in the pandemic and decided to just ""ring the bell."" Healthcare costs are a challenge as he bridges his own coverage upto Medicare age.   Healthcare insurance is often what keeps people working longer than they'd prefer, even when otherwise ready to call it quits.

I've taken control of her retirement accounts and re-allocated them to VTSAX/VXUS/BND, but I did not do so with her brokerage accounts because it would require liquidating the accounts. this would have created a ton in capital gains tax that I wanted to avoid, so I let Chase continue to manage it.  I spoke with our advisor earlier this year, at which point there was roughly 30k in realized gains. I let him know that I was unhappy with this, and he stated that they would use some tax loss harvesting strategies to mitigate this.

I ended up getting a rate that was about 3% lower so decided to go ahead.  When it was all said and done, I saved myself $500. And the process was a bit of a headache because it ended up being through a credit union that I had to join, create a checking account for, and fund. And once it was all set up I found out that I could only set up automatic payments to be pulled from the credit union checking account, not my main banking checking account. So I've had to set up an automatic transfer from my main account to the credit union account, then set up an automatic payment from that account to the loan account.  At least twice a year something goes wrong and a payment doesn't get applied. So I have to call and troubleshoot it. Fortunately they're usually pretty helpful and address it quickly, but it's still \~15 minutes.

investing,Dec,1hbfejl,Compound Investing is amazing!,"I \[35M\] live in HCOL and have always invested very small amounts since my teenage years making minimum wage.  I really took investing seriously when I turned 32 and landed a job that matches 50% of my 401k contribution, offers mega backdoor ROTH, HSA, ESPP, awarded me RSU's, and my wife started a new career.  I've watched my net worth (including home) increase from $250K in 2019 to $1.25M in 2024.  The $1M growth in 5 years is a huge accomplishment, but I'm even more proud of seeing my investment portfolio alone grow from $580K on Jan 1, 2024 to over $900K before the year ends.  I honestly can't believe I surpassed 4 $100K milestones in one fiscal year alone and so excited to see my portfolio exceed $1M in hopefully a few short months.","Sounds more like your recent massive increase in income, especially during the past two years, after the lows of 2022, contributed most to your gains.","That's what I was thinking too.  while compound interest helps, jumping from 250k to 1.25M in 5 years screams big income boost.

And ""compound interest"" would be demonstrated by the exact opposite of this, wherein you would contribute a little bit over many years - hence lots of time to COMPOUND."

investing,Dec,1h5ldip,The surprisingly negative sentiment in Europe towards S&amp;P500 compared to FTSE All-World ,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here and I look forward to broaden my perspective.   I am a non-EU citizen working in Europe and prefer a passive investing strategy with the S&amp;P500. I find it surprising that the folks in European subreddit like r/eupersonalfinance and r/ETFs_Europe strictly prefer an All-World index to S&amp;P500. I recently posted there pointing out several reasons why it should not be such a definitive preference, such as the positive correlation, the political risks of emerging markets, US' strong stock market and entrepreneurship, and most importantly the lack of innovation, overregulation &amp; non-competitiveness of Europe.   Since the responses I get there are inherently limited by one perspective, I'm eager to discuss with a broader audience. What is your take on this topic?","If I were to ask you why you're investing specifically in the USA and not the rest of the world, you'd likely list reasons that are already widely known and baked into the price.  Currently, companies in the S&amp;P 500 index trade at prices over 30 times their earnings, which is historically very expensive. In comparison, the Stoxx 600 trades at around 15 times earnings. In other words, the market *already agrees* with you that American companies will dominate globally in the future. That belief doesn‚Äôt make you exceptionally insightful, and you won‚Äôt get rich by betting on what everyone else already bets on.  Stocks outperform not when they do well, but when they exceed expectations (which may or may not be high themselves). For the S&amp;P 500 to outperform, American companies must dominate even more than the market already expects. Meanwhile, for the Stoxx 600, it's enough for European companies to be less shitty than the low expectations currently priced in.","Everything you said was also true ten years ago, and then for the next 10 years the US would have gone on absolutely historic bull run. And it‚Äôs entirely possible that we wake up a few years from now and the trend continues. So obviously there‚Äôs something more going on, and angle that your model doesn‚Äôt address.",GAAP reporting is important to me as well..  I tend to stay away from Chinese and South American companies because you can't trust the books,"&gt;My problem is with the weight of the US in All-World indices (60-70%) compared to Europe.  That's a standard, no-bets approach with cap weighted ETF. If you want to make a bet by tilting to a sector/region, you can do that easily with an extra purchase.  &gt;Europe needs to do exceptionally well to offset all the underperformance of previous periods, for the diversification to be worth it.  I think if you're saying this then you're *not* getting the priced-in argument. It does not need to do exceptionally well; it's the S&amp;P500 companies that need to do very exceptionally well to justify their sky-high valuations. Reread my last comment, in particular the last paragraph.","Honestly I'm French and I much prefer invest in the S&amp;P rather than the cac40 (French market) and even EU. Germany and France are both in crisis. Germany on a structural basis and France we have no government and no vision for the future, with a gigantic debt.","I'm not vouching for ex-US, I'm saying that the tailwinds for US businesses are priced in, making the decision between US and ex-US from today's perspective effectively a coinflip.",But politics influences stock prices‚Ä¶,"If you live in a EUR country, you remove some currency risk by having a larger part of your money in EUR stocks. When it comes to predicting US vs EU, I‚Äôm an index guy myself. Hope that strategy continues to work.","Tbf, preferring S&amp;P 500 to the All World Index is an inherent bet on US political policy","Salut, I work in Germany and we are witnessing the collapse in real time. Extreme aversion to anything innovative, bottleneck level of bureaucracy to even remotely start a business, and a decade-long debt brake that prevents any investment in the depreciated infrastructure. It is very depressing.  One can argue that all of those are priced in, but the return on investment happens only when Europe recovers better than expected. I highly doubt that is the case."

Am I misunderstanding this?  EDIT: I think I worded this in a confusing way. To be clear, I like a progressive tax üòÇ. My question is that why would someone with total income of 50k have the same capital gain tax rate as someone with a total income of 450k. As opposed to some linear scale where 50k earners would have close to 0% and 500k earners would have closer to 15%","If I'm reading your post correctly, the short but slightly inaccurate answer is yes. The thresholds refer to taxable income, so bear in mind that the first $15,000 for singles and $30,000 for couples is typically not taxable. Let's look at a few simplified single filers:   * Isaac earned $30,000 from work and has $10,000 of long-term capital gains (LTCG). His taxable income is $25,000 (30K +10K - 15K standard deduction). He pays 0-12% on his working income no tax on his LTCG. * Jane earns $65,000 from work and has $10,000 of LTCG. Her taxable income is $60,000 (65K + 10K - 15K). She pays 0-22% on her working income and 15% or $1,500 on her LTCG. * Harry earns $165,000 from work and has $10,000 of LTCG. His taxable income is $160,000 (165K + 10K - 15K). He pays 0-24% on his working income and 15% or $1,500 on his LTCG.   I chose those numbers to neatly fit into each category and to avoid NIIT. But yes, Jane and Harry each pay 15% on their capital gains.  ""Seems crazy"" is a matter of opinion, all I can say is that's basically [what we've always done](https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/fed_capgains_taxrates-20100830.pdf). Low earners get taxed more lightly, but from roughly the median and up it's a mostly flat rate. If anything NIIT makes it more progressive now.

I don‚Äôt need the money so I would just reinvest into a non-tax advantaged account. Is this reasonable to do every year so there aren‚Äôt big 22% hits years later?",It would be a good idea to do Roth conversions.,"Accountant here, first let me clarify something in case I'm not reading your post correctly, the 12% and 22% you mention is a marginal rate, so not all of your income would be taxed at 22%. Additionally, this rate is only applied to \*taxable\* income, which is determined \*after\* you take your deductions.  In the circumstance you gave of $60,000 in income, you could actually withdraw an additional $63,500 before you hit the next marginal rate of 24%, this is of course assuming you take the standard deduction of $29,200 for 2024.  This would mean your tax liability, all else being equal, would be $10,852.  Admittedly, however, I don't understand the purpose of withdrawing beyond your required minimum distribution (if you're over 73) if you are only going to reinvest it into another account, this would just trigger another taxable event.  Regardless, I would advise consulting with a licensed CPA and have them give advice. You could find a CPA who also holds a CFP, but it doesn't sound like it's necessary here.","DIY only. It‚Äôs a transfer of shares or cash from a traditional account to a Roth account. It‚Äôs taxed exactly as if you had withdrawn, only the money ends up permanently tax-sheltered at the end.",Instead of pulling more than you need convert the excess to Roth.  Now it is tax free for life and it only cost you 12%.,"Ok, sounds like this is the way and I‚Äôve heard the term before. Is it something I can do myself through vanguard or do I hire a professional?","My Vanguard 401k allows in-plan Roth conversions, and yes I typically try to fill the 12% bracket via either Roth IRA or 401k conversions each year.   I think it may vary from employer to employer if in-plan Roth conversions are allowed. It can be a little frustrating to find where to do the conversion on the website (goddam I hate the new website).  Act quick, the deadline is Dec 31.   If your plan does not have in-plan conversions you might still be able to do Roth conversions but I‚Äôm not clear on those details.","&gt;the 12% and 22% you mention is a marginal rate, so not all of your income would be taxed at 22%  I came to say the same. I'm not an accountant, but I don't know of many taxes in the US that aren't progressive. You're not going to suddenly flip that 22% to apply to everything you've withdrawn.","It is usually best to fill out your 12% bracket with roth conversions.  I don't do this, because I am saving 13K a year by getting subsidized health insurance, but will be doing it when I turn 65 years old.","I got the sense OP is not working if they are talking about withdrawing from a workplace plan.

I grew up somewhat poor, so living on a tight budget is easy for me.

Is this 120k enough for retirement? it is 40 years away. Historically, the s&amp;p 500 has returned about 11.8% (7.8 after inflation) over the past 50 years.

investing,Dec,1h4wos2,Barrons: Intel CEO Gelsinger Retires. The Stock Is Gaining.,"[Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/intel-stock-price-ceo-gelsinger-retires-0fed48c5)  Intel _ CEO Pat Gelsinger retired from the chip maker and stepped down from the board, effective Dec. 1, the company announced Monday.  Intel has named two senior leaders, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, as interim co-chief executive officers while the board begins a search for a new CEO. Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Holthaus has been appointed to CEO of Intel Products.  Frank Yeary, independent chair of the board, will become interim executive chair during the period of transition.  ‚ÄúWhile we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,‚Äù Yeary said in a statement.  Intel stock gained 4% to $25.03 in premarket trading Monday. This year, shares have tumbled 52%.","At the very least, they won‚Äôt have their CEO constantly tweeting prayers of deliverance to the almighty‚Ä¶","It's hard to see Pat leaving being good for the business overall. I suppose short term it increases the odds of a sale or something, so perhaps that is why the market is happy.","Market doesn't always make sense or always make sense immediately. The dip from the few days before this news today could have been Pat or insiders selling early, it going up today could be because those who won out the c-suite battle are increasing stakes, could be traders/algos closing short positions due to news, or it could just be the market just reacting to change (INTC shares also went up when Bob Swan was fired and when Pat was named as CEO).  I personally still believe what I believed when Pat got the job: dude's not the perfect guy for the job but he's a guy that fits what they need and is available. An old shoe that fits is better than no shoes or clown shoes without soles.   Bob Swan, his c-suite, and the c-suite before him where the ones that lead to INTC's downfall from dominance. It happened because they allowed a business management type to get to the head of the company so OFC they do ""business"" type shit: spend less on R&amp;D, more sales staff less engineering, looking for clever accounting rather than clever tech innovations, M&amp;A to secure contracts/sales/barriers rather than acquiring talent, etcetcetc.   INTC realized they were wrong so they brought in Pat as a ""tech"" guy to bring INTC back into the tech front, turn the ship around, and reclaim market share. Problem is INTC had way too many issues to fix rather than JUST tech and Pat himself while a bit aged for a CEO, is very aged for a CEO trying to right a leaking ship, and a fucking dino on the tech front (where fucking PHD college grads 4-6 years graduation are considered ""washed"" and might need re-education or updating of their skills).  TL;DR Pat was the right direction but too many issues with INTC for him to fix. I think it's market vol and looking at thing short term rather than real upside since INTC hasn't given a real better alternative as a replacement since they have 2 interm-CEOs.","my ass, intel is at best three years away from a turnaround and Pat departing changes nothing, betcha this will drive up AMD more than INTC","wait, this isn't a joke?",So what Messiah are they going to hire to save this company from bankruptcy?,"Because he was a terrible hire.  Intel's issues stem from deep cultural problems that come from being top dog of decades.  Pat IS the embodiment of that culture.  He may be a talented engineer, but Intel needs a culture shock the same way AMD needed a dynamic change.    One can know something very well and still not be a good leader.  Pat wasn't the right guy.  Intel STILL is getting high on their own supply with blunder after blunder that should have been caught and would have been by someone more skeptical.  Intel being saved needs an outsider with no deep ties to Intel's culture or glory days.  Someone who can objectively look at the issues and address them.",Grandma is smiling,"It's easy to blame Bob Swan, but he did not want the job in the first place when Brian Krzanich got fired. Only after a year of fruitless searching did the Intel board ""settle"" for Bob Swan.  &gt; Bob Swan, his c-suite, and the c-suite before him where the ones that lead to INTC's downfall from dominance.  This is wrong.  Not totally defending Bob Swan, but the biggest problem was Brian Krzanich and the failure of 10nm, so earlier. Couple that with some of the worst bureaucracy in the tech world, bleeding of engineering talent for years, and arrogance, you have the Intel of today.","If this was supposedly the technical guy, I dont want to know whom they have as non technical"
investing,Dec,1ha3j08,The interesting increase in Quantum Computing Stocks,"I have noticed that many Quantum Stocks have risen an abnormal amount of 3,5,10 times their value in recent months. I cannot fully wrap my head around this amount of increase. Is this because they have found a more efficent way to run Quantum Computers or Is it because they got offered a huge offer to continue their research.  I would really aprrieate getting some explanation from people that are already looking into this.",Quantum stocks are a superposition of greatly overvalued and undervalued.,"Quantum Computing still hasn‚Äôt reached the stage of widespread practical application. They are still largely in the developmental stage. Like all investments, future expectations is what drives the price changes in the quantum computing sector. As new information comes out about the application of quantum computing or the timeline of its full development prices will adjust, but much quicker than most retail investors can react. For now, these changes are still speculative.   I‚Äôd be weary to invest in any particular sector including quantum computing, not because I don‚Äôt believe in it, but because much of the information we base our investment decisions on are already priced in.","It‚Äôs a pump along with crypto. Quantum computing is seen as the crypto killer, so anytime crypto gets a pump, so does quantum.   It‚Äôs going to crash just like crypto. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason quantum should be 10x the price it was 6 months ago.   I was in for a lot at very low levels, sold at 5x profit, and while I‚Äôm regretting the sell a bit, I know it‚Äôs just emotion and fomo. It hurts to see it keep jumping, but I truly don‚Äôt believe that it should have this valuation yet. Once they develop more and become mainstream, I believe it should hold this value, but that‚Äôs likely a facade away at best","üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ A very dignified and undginified comment, and every state between the two.","Eh, doubt it. That line is like the one basic fact that nearly every lay-person knows about quantum mechanics.",Lol quantum computing isn‚Äôt ready for use in commercial settings.¬†  Braket is a testing and research product. Everything outside of their ‚ÄúRun‚Äù piece is just simulation anyways.,Quantum computing is a solution to AI's main problem which is processing and power. Quantum can decrease the power constraints needed with AI significantly.

No probably not. I literally work in this industry and sit through hours of mandatory training each month to make sure I am as up to date with things like this in the industry as possible. Again, this just shows you don't understand what this is really talking about , it doesn't matter what specific applications they are talking about, whoever achieves quantum computing first holds the key to unlocking the entire worlds encryption standards. If you don't understand what that means or how dangerously life changing that will be for every industry on the planet, I don't know what to tell you.",All of the markets have been popping. It‚Äôs just that.
investing,Dec,1hhfzxl,Why are 10 year US bonds selling off amid Fed rate cuts?,"Pretty much the title. I'm old and classically taught that bond yields and prices have an inverse relationship.  Shouldn't the price of existing bonds be increasing as newly issued bonds will pay a lower interest rate? Instead, bonds are selling off sharply.  So why is the yield on 10yr US bonds climbing steeply while the Fed is cutting interest rates? In fact, this behavior began in the immediate aftermath of the 50bps Fed rate cut in September.  Thank you to anyone who helps me understand.","The yield curve is un-inverting, longer rates were lower only because investors anticipated a return of fed rate back down close to zero, so buying a slightly lower long term rate would have locked in a comparatively good deal relative to expected short term notes and bills, now it appears 3.5 may be the base, if you can get 3.5 in cash, you need more than that the get people to take on the risk and buy a longer term note or bond, hence people are dumping there lower yielding bonds while they can.","The market expected 4 rate cuts for 2025, but that expectation was amended to 2 rate cuts with todays‚Äôs fed meeting. This caused a correction to bond prices and to the market. The rate cut today was highly anticipated so it was already priced in anyways.","That‚Äôs too generic of a response. What people in this thread aren‚Äôt explaining to OP is that longer dated bonds are a reflection of investor expectations around the economy and inflation. With Powell changing his tune on the pace of rate cuts next year and uncertainty around Trump‚Äôs upcoming presidency, investors are rightfully spooked.","The Fed only controls the short end of curve. Treasuries up to 2 years. Longer dated bonds 10, 20, 30 yr treasuries trade with the market. 20-25% of our $37T national debt (roughly 9T) plus the $2T deficit we run each year, half of which is due to interest on the $37T needs to be sold every year. That's $11T give or take 1T. Half of that is rolled into the longer dated bonds. So, we need to move around $5-$6T every year in these bonds. Who wants to buy all that paper, and at what price? You're investing in the US government. How's their credit? Who's running it? Do you want to give them your money for 10 years or more for a measly 4.4%?",The change from 4 cuts to 2 cuts is basically the fed saying they expect Trump‚Äôs policies to be more inflationary.,"That's a really good explanation of what's happening. The market priced in super low rates for longer, but now that 3.5% looks more like the floor, those older lower-yielding bonds aren't as attractive.       Why lock up money for years at a lower rate when you can get 3.5% in cash? Makes total sense that people are selling off while they can.","A quick answer is the Fed does not set bond rates, investors/market does.  A bit longer is investors are demanding a certain return on bonds to buy them and they will mostly ignore the Fed rate for a longer term bond (Fed rate is for overnight loans). Investors are not willing to buy a 10 year for under 4.5% (aprox) return today. Investors are anticipating continued inflation (or inflation rate moving sideways) as well as issues around the government having to sell more bonds in the future to fund it's operations (especially if taxes are cut reducing revenue). If the U.S. government issues too many bonds, they have to offer higher rates to sell them. So part of this is the bond market saying they expect long bond rates to stay high as the government issues more bonds to fund more deficit spending (via future bond sales).  As an investor, what would you be willing to take, in terms of the yield, to tie-up tour money for 10 years? Market is saying 4.5% (today) is what it takes.","To be clear , the rate cut today was priced in  What changed that was not priced in were the future rate cuts in 2025",Bonds were priced with 3 cuts expectations and the Fed announced 2.,"It's actually a much more specific response than yours. You are saying there will be generally fewer rate cuts in the future, and you responded to a comment saying that there will be specifically be only 2, adjusted down from 4 previously expected in 2025..."
investing,Dec,1hiyr8s,I finally set up automatic investments after a year of mental gymnastics.,"***TL;DR:***  ***I got tired of the stress of manual investments into our VOO brokerage. I set up automatic weekly contributions of $50 to dollar-cost average and grow our holdings. I‚Äôm letting go of the mental battle of trying to time the market and trusting the long-term benefits of staying invested. Historically, those in the market come out ahead.***  I‚Äôm fully expecting this post to be downvoted to oblivion, but I‚Äôm writing it in hopes that it‚Äôll reach others who have struggled like I have. I‚Äôll keep it brief to spare you a wall of text.    I‚Äôm in my early 40s and have built up what I consider a big emergency fund in a high-yield savings account (HYSA). For the last year, I‚Äôve been manually investing in VOO. My wife and I also have a solid 401(k) from her career that should take care of us pretty well in the future.    Our VOO holdings aren‚Äôt huge compared to some of you, but it currently accounts for about 18% of our savings. Managing this has been a mental rollercoaster. I‚Äôm not an investing expert. In fact, a lot of this stuff confuses me. I get nervous when the market moves, and like many, I‚Äôve been worried about what the incoming administration might do with the economy. Recently, I‚Äôve had intrusive thoughts like, ‚ÄúI should just sell everything in VOO and put it back in the HYSA where it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù    I‚Äôve been watching investing YouTube (not always helpful) and reading posts in this subreddit. The recurring advice I see is simple: automate your investments, stop trying to time the market, and let your money work for you.    So today, I finally acted on that advice. I logged into Vanguard and set up automatic weekly investments of $50 into VOO. It‚Äôs not a huge amount, but it‚Äôs a start. I‚Äôm tired of the mental gymnastics and the anxiety of trying to manage it manually. I want to be one of those people who let their money work hard for them instead of just working hard to save it.    We don‚Äôt have specific plans for this money right now‚Äîmaybe one day we‚Äôll pull some out for something meaningful‚Äîbut for now, I just want it to grow. I‚Äôll check in on its progress occasionally, but otherwise, I‚Äôm choosing to trust the long-term growth of the market.     Thanks for reading. I hope this resonates with someone out there. If not, best of luck to all of us. We‚Äôll need it.","Now you just need a mechanism to motivate you to increase that weekly amount.

They‚Äôll give you some solid advice about diversification. They can be a bit dogmatic at times about international holdings, but solid information nonetheless.

Either way, good on you dude. Good luck üëçüèª",I‚Äôve been auto investing into VTSAX (previously VTSMX) for almost 2 decades now.  It‚Äôs silly how much that has worked.,No go join your new sub /r/Bogleheads,Great work!,"In my opinion, the financial markets are 90% psychological and 10% quantitative when it comes to the involvement of living humans rather than algorithms.   For what it's worth i think setting up auto-invest is an excellent decision if it helps you remove the psychological factor from your investment. Part of why I got away from day trading was the psychological factor - the stress was very hard on me. We all face unique challenges and have unique adaptations to handle them.   Best of luck to you.",Congratulations! Now your job is to allocate your now freed mental resources towards increasing your take home pay and using that take home pay to save more. Target $100/w next.,"Funny you mention the HYSA interest. That figure was what sort of pushed me to do it. I thought, at the very least, most of what I was auto investing would come from that and it sort of helped tip the mental scale for me. My $50/week is what I was comfortable starting with given my hesitations of the world ahead, but I hope I increase it a bit in 2025.","I have my emergency sitting in HYSA and down payment for a house sitting in CDs.

investing,Dec,1haoskc,Bank advisor getting passively aggressive after I moved most of my funds to a different brokerage? ,"Has anyone experienced this?   For some background, my family had a good relationship with the bank A and this advisor who has in the past got us mortgages/loans at very competitive rates. However the bank A itself offers literally nothing despite us having a significant amount asset under their management.   Meanwhile Bank B is offering a 1% bonus for transfers and a tons of perks for the amount of asset we have at Bank A. As a result I‚Äôm in the process of moving most of our investments from Band A to B. However recently the advisor has really very passively aggressive with me, and asked to book a meeting with me to assess my portfolio and risk tolerance or they would close my account by Dec 31st lmao.   Before I react, I just wanted to know if I‚Äôm in the wrong? Or if there is anything I did that would be considered unethical? I thought we are in a free market‚Ä¶  Thanks","You are trying to optimize your assets and gains for your future. Banker A is not. End of story. You owe him nothing. Just in fairness ask if he is ready to match the offer from bank B, which he likely cannot. Then you know what to do. You‚Äôve gotten his attention (bank A) because it looks like he hasn‚Äôt done much for you and now you‚Äôre simply taking the consequences.","You were fair, and they still failed.   Maximising returns is completely logical and reasonable.   And if you new bank ever pulls the same shit, or if you find somewhere with a better offer move again.   Corporations sold off customer loyalty about the same time they sold all their staff loyalty.  It‚Äôs all about profits for them, why should it be different for you?

Over the next year or so I learned a bit more about investing, and decided to calculate how the returns from that advisor compared to an S&amp;P500 index.  I found the advisor underperformed by about $12K. So I transferred all my money out to Vanguard without saying anything.  Few days later he called, kinda upset, asking why I didn't talk to him at first. I told him he cost me X amount by not doing an average job. He kinda stammered that he had access to the same funds, and then the conversation ended.  You are the customer. It's your money. If they are not doing something to earn your business, go elsewhere.

A lot of these companies hire the dumbest people.,"&gt; He kinda stammered that he had access to the same funds, and then the conversation ended.  ""So did you underperform deliberately, or unintentionally? Which is worse?""","The advisor is unprofessionally aggressive. Also he did not do a good job since the bank obviously invested your significant assets, earn money, but did not give you competitive rates to keep thw money with the bank.  However, on a separate note, in my area there are banks that if you fall below a certain threshold, they will stop servicing you because they have better net worth clients. So not surprising if they want to remove you.",Just pull the rest of the investments. He clearly doesn‚Äôt want what remains of your business and you clearly aren‚Äôt happy with his service.,Nah it's probably to tell op about how risky it is to move to bank B! Not like how safe bank A is! He's just looking out for op!,"More likely, his cut would have been smaller than whatever he had your money in.

investing,Dec,1hdd5yr,"Why keep money out of the market that you plan to use in the next 5 years, if you have enough to cover a 30% market crash?","The common advice, which has a lot of merit to it, says to keep cash you plan to use within 5 years in a high yield savings account (or bonds, etc).   I can think of three major upsides to this. First, you ensure that you can actually afford to make the purchase. Second, you ensure you don't have to sell stocks at a loss to fund your payment. Third, this all gives you peace of mind.  But what if factors 1 and 3 don't apply? What if you have enough money in your accounts such that there's no doubt that you can afford to make the payment even in a 30% market crash, and moreover that this is something you can EASILY afford (e.g. it's like no more than 10% of your money).   The downside to keeping money in a money market or bond, instead of say an index fund like VOO or VTI, is slightly (over the short run) or great (over the long run) risk-adjusted returns. Over time VOO outperforms a money market ... after a few years the percentage gets up in the 80% ... so it does seem like a profit maximizing choice.  Why not do this? The downside seems minimal and the upside is important. Most people have a 20k+ purchase every 5 or so year (home renovation, car, etc), and 20k compounded over 30 years minus what you'd get from a money market is probably about 100k in profit.",Because if you‚Äôre forced to sell in a crash your losses are compounded in the future.,"You are correct, presuming there is little market volatility and sequencing risk.  Having a buffer in cash and defensive assets such as high grade short duration government bonds are a form of downside protection.   *If* the market underperforms, especially for a significant period of time, then a portfolio with these sorts of assets will do better and recover quicker than one which does not.  The counterpoint being if the market performs well, you are sacrificing potential future returns.  It is one of the reasons that if you are already rich it is easier to become even richer, than it is to become rich in the first place, because you can take on risky investments without them wiping you out when they go wrong. Which is, essentially the venture capital model.","Same goes for the gains you might make if you stay invested. In fact, the market tends to go up, especially over periods like 2+ years, so that math is not really in favor of your point.","I think you missed that it's about money you will need. If you have 30% more, that 30% is not money you need, but money you can afford to lose.",Because the crash might be 40 or 50%.,"Keeping all your money in cash, or all in risky investments, whatever you like, is just one of the many luxuries of being rich.   The less money you have, the more important it is to follow the recommendations.","I haven't heard of this advice...5 years is a lot of cash to keep on the sideline.  If you can afford it, I would stay invested in VOO as much as possible and consider a portfolio / securities line of credit where you can access cash when needed",Very good point. Cheers,Do what you want  It‚Äôs trying to avoid a downside you‚Äôre not particularly concerned with. You may be fine. You may come out with a significant loss. You‚Äôll survive it either way.,Compound interest works in both directions. If the market goes up 50% then up 50% again it's much more than a 100% return.

investing,Dec,1he3s5k,"Is the idea that MicroStrategy (MSTR) provides value to shareholders by issuing debt and equity to buy Bitcoin valid, or is it absurd ?","After adopting the Bitcoin strategy, to their credit, and thanks to the company‚Äôs cult-like following, MSTR stock delivered impressive returns (\~600% return over the last year).  However, Michael Saylor (the company‚Äôs chairman and former CEO) continues to champion this Bitcoin strategy while dismissing the clear risks that could lead to a catastrophic crash potentially hurting uninformed investors in the process.Here‚Äôs how I believe a crash for MSTR could unfold:  1. Bitcoin (eventually) faces a significant or prolonged drop in value.  2. Debt conversion fails: MicroStrategy would be forced to sell Bitcoin at a loss to meet convertible debt obligations, exacerbated by buying Bitcoin at all-time-high prices.  3. Debt holders exercise put options: Other debt holders would demand repayment in cash, creating additional liquidity stress.  4. The cycle accelerates. More Bitcoin sold at a loss ‚Üí increased pressure on debt repayments ‚Üí even more selling.Ultimately, this could cause MSTR stock to trade at a significant discount to its net asset value (NAV), further eroding shareholder confidence.  The most obvious trade here is to short the stock while buying Bitcoin as a hedge, effectively betting on MSTR‚Äôs Bitcoin NAV premium shrinking from \~3x to 1x or lower.   However, this strategy comes with challenges: heightened volatility, high short interest (driven by convertible arbitrage strategies from debtors), and the elevated cost of shorting either via stock or options.What is clear.   however, is that MSTR currently trades at a significant premium to its intrinsic value. While this overvaluation may persist or even widen in the short term, a significant correction seems [inevitable.Open](http://inevitable.Open) to thoughts and pushback!

investing,Dec,1hgfji2,The big boys getting bigger?,"I‚Äôve been really reviewing and tweaking my overall portfolio recently and it has gotten me reading lots of threads and articles about diversification(small/mid cap, international, sp500) etc. With that rotating some QQQM/VGT/VOO into assets like VTI/VXUS/VT  as I previously had little to no exposure to things outside the USA large caps.   However, I can‚Äôt help but help but feel like buying anything but the biggest companies is just going to weigh down the portfolio.  Hear me out, we see the biggest tech companies gobbling up more and more market share as Mag7 with hands in everything along with the other top companies. They wield so much market influence and power over any competition. Just saw an article about Walmart/amazon/costco picking up something like 60% of every incremental dollar on retail this year. It‚Äôs happening within every industry. Hospitals being gobbled up, grocery chains, cell phone providers, airlines, etc.   In addition everything in the US is designed with extracting more and more money from people and funneling to these mega corporations. With hardly anything protecting everyday Americans from rampant greed, Whether it‚Äôs for profit healthcare, no mandated sick/PTO time, taxes/fees increasing at every level(sales tax, income tax, city taxes, car registration, insurance premiums, etc.), among many other things that other countries at least somewhat still protect. Congress is clearly bought by corporations and benefits by trading in these companies with legal inside trading and thus have negative incentive to change this status quo of the bigger getting bigger.   At no point in history have so few companies wielded such vast global control and had such little regulation to stop them from continuing to bully their way over anyone smaller.   TLDR: My conviction was and is that in this late stage capitalism world we live in. Especially in America.. there is no competing with the big boys. As money gets funneled to the ultra wealthy at an exponentially increasing pace people have less money and then end up spending with the biggest companies who have pricing and volume power over not just mom and pop shops but anyone not already dominating their respective market. So any diversification into non top companies is really a losing proposal. VOO, QQQM, and SCHG or similar tickers will only continue to accelerate and provide outsized returns vs most other categories.   Not financial advise. Just my thoughts. Curious as to the communities thoughts.

For the rest of us who are willing to put some skin in the game, best we can do is follow their moves as closely as possible, unless we're one of the lucky few who comes up with the new innovation that turns into a goldmine, or we make a lucky guess on an option call like a small percentage of the members of /r/wallstreetbets","Mega caps are already priced at a much higher P/E and P/B than small caps.

Plus the US refineries are designed to process the ""sour"" crude which contains more sulfur and sulfates than Saudi or Texas ""Sweet"" oil that we have. So most of the stuff we produce we have to export, and then we import the shitty stuff from Canada and other places.  Oil companies don't work for free, they need to make a profit... and CEOs of Exxon, BP, Shell, and few other oil companies have said Drill Baby Drill is not going to work... and they are not interested in deregulation.

But 2025 seems particularly risky IMO because of the valuations, on well, everything. Stocks, real estate, crypto, gov't debt.

There's an article in the Economics forum about commercial real estate woes. By itself it's not the end of the world, but with the gov't debt where it's at, dropping fed rates back to 0 with bank failures won't have the same effect cause bond vigilantes will ramp up the 10 year. If stocks fall, what happens to home prices when they are both at all time highs? In 2008 they both went down. What if stocks fall then crypto freaks then stocks fall more?

investing,Dec,1h7rxix,Is there any reason to be invested in a Target-Date fund vs a total stock market index (401k)? ,"Is there any reason to be invested in a Target-Date fund vs a total stock market index (401k)? I‚Äôve done great over the last 12 years investing my 401k in a target date fund, however I feel like I‚Äôve left $100k on the table by doing so‚Ä¶ thoughts?        $250k balance as of today. When I look at the target date fund vs the Dow or S&amp;P over that same period it‚Äôs a huge percentage behind. With that said, I understand that the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of the target date fund is also to somewhat protect you from large losses especially as you get older. So two sides this I suppose.","Target Date funds are conservative ways to invest for people who really have no idea what they're doing, and/or for 401ks to offer a ""safe"" option as a default. They won't perform that well compared to funds that are more focused on stocks, but they'll also keep a good % in bonds so they won't get hit in a downturn as much, and of course the whole point is they get more conservative as you get closer to the target date to protect people who aren't watching their investments.","A lot of people have claimed that TDFs are too conservative for a young investor. I disagree, though it does depend on the fund &amp; the investor. Bonds account for very little of the difference in performance between an all-US-stock portfolio &amp; many TDFs designed for young investors.    Bonds have had little impact on the performance of these performance TDFs; it's mostly been the international stocks.  Adding international stocks doesn't make a fund more conservative.  Historically, US stocks &amp; international stocks have taken turns outperforming each other. US stocks have dominated recently, but that tide could turn at any time.    I'm most familiar with Vanguard's TDFs, so I'll use them as an example. I've never invested in one, but they're a great choice for a lot of investors who value convenience &amp; are willing to pay a little bit for it.    Vanguard TDFs start out with a 90/10 stock/bond allocation &amp; stick with that for many years before starting to gradually shift more towards bonds twenty-five years before the target date.    The difference in performance between a 90/10 portfolio &amp; a 100/0 portfolio is usually pretty small, but the difference in risk is usually much larger. This makes it much easier for an investor to hold onto the TDF through a bear market instead of selling in a panic, a move that would cost much more than the performance difference.    For a US-only portfolio, over the last 30+ years, the performance difference has been less than 0.4% CAGR. However, the risk (standard deviation) difference has been about 1.5%. (I expect longer time periods would show similar results.) 22 years into this comparison, the 90/10 portfolio was slightly ahead. Only the longest bull market in US history created much of a gap.    Why then, you may ask, have funds like Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund (VTSAX &amp; VTI) beaten Vanguard's TDFs by such a large margin recently? The answer is not bonds; it's international stocks.     So, pick an all-US-stock portfolio (total market or S&amp;P 500) over a TDF if you like. But please understand that the TDF is only slightly more conservative &amp; has its own advantages. Of course, past performance is not an indicator of future results.   https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&amp;mode=1&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=1972&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2023&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;asset1=TotalStockMarket&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;allocation1_2=90&amp;allocation1_3=54&amp;asset2=TotalBond&amp;allocation2_2=10&amp;allocation2_3=10&amp;asset3=IntlStockMarket&amp;allocation3_3=36&amp;asset4=GlobalBond    I didn't include international bonds in my analysis because their impact on the portfolio is small.  Also, the comparison period would have been much shorter because some years of data are not available for international bonds.","Related to ‚Äúno idea what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù, another benefit of target date funds is that they‚Äôre *very* hands-off. You pick your target date and set up your deposits, and that‚Äôs pretty much it. The fund managers rebalance each year, and about every five years they shift a bit from stocks to bonds to cash.","Reason: Nobody can predict the future, if they can they surely aren't posting on Reddit about it. Past results don't predict future performance.","Most investors here are young enough to not be painfully be reminded of S&amp;P500 in the 2000-2009 era.  If you had all your money in a 500 index fund, you severely underperformed anybody that was even moderately diversified in international and bonds.  Target date funds are typically more diversified so they have some protections against an extended market downturn.  Of course they give up on gains when US large caps do well.    IMO if you have a 20-30 year timeline where you can afford a 10 year recovery, invest in low fee index tracking funds.  Once you get within 10 years, get a a low fee target date fund with the correct annuity/bonds mix, and use that to protect against a severe downturn that could result in you working extra years.    It all depends on your risk tolerance.  Rocking a 100% SP500 index fund until your retirement date is risky.  It might work out.

I'd recommend index funds but honestly just opening a Roth with whichever investment you'd prefer puts you ahead of 99% of your peers.,Damnit Grandma,6-12% a year  Unless it‚Äôs this year. Then 40%. You‚Äôre a little late tho.,"get a reputable brokerage, put it all into VOO, then put all your extra money in there for the next 20 years and you'll have more money than you know what to do with by the end of it.",S&amp;P 500,"Here are your priorities:  If you have any debt with an interest rate greater than about 9%, apply it towards that. Everything I'm about to demonstrate for compounding interest works against you when we're talking about debt, so eliminate that first!     After debt, if you don't have an emergency fund, determine what three months of living expenses looks like for you. Put that much of the money aside in a savings account or short term (3 months or under) US Treasuries. At 23, you've already started to realize that life happens. It's good to have money in the bank when it does. I don't know what price you'd put on peace of mind, but I think it's more than $10,000 plus interest.     Whatever is leftover is where the choice really begins: if you want to do something fun to honor your loved one, do it. If you want to invest it - and that's an excellent idea! - put as much of it as you can in a tax-advantaged account and invest in a broad index fund. Don't look at, think about, or touch that investment other than periodically adding to it until you've reached at least the age where the money can be withdrawn without being taxed (assuming a Roth IRA in the US, that means 55 if you're retiring, or 59.5 in all cases).  The S&amp;P 500 is standard advice. I recommend FXAIX for its very low expense ratio. You can put up to $7000 into a Roth IRA per year if you're under the income threshold, so do that. The S&amp;P doubles approximately every 7 years accounting for inflation (and every 4-5 years if we don't account for inflation), so assuming that you retire at 65, you have about 6 doubling periods (after inflation) left. That means that if invested intelligently, the value of this inheritance is about $10k -&gt; 1. $20k in seven years -&gt; 2. $40k in fourteen years -&gt; 3. $80k in twenty-one years -&gt; 4. $160k in twenty-eight years -&gt; 5. $320k in thirty-five years -&gt; 6. **$640k in forty-two years** if you hold and don't sell, even when there are steep downturns.   According to the 4% rule (which is really about 4.2%, but I'll round down to play it safe), that means that you can withdraw the equivalent of $25,600 in today's dollars every year after you retire with $640k *without ever touching the principle*. If you live to be 95, that makes the money worth an additional $768k in real spending power *as long as you trust the power of compound interest and do not sell it until you are at least 65 years old*.  That's a very nice head start at your age. Congratulations and condolences.  By the way, please open up a Roth IRA and take advantage of any 401k/403b/457b/TSP/etc. that you may have access to as early as possible regardless of how much of this inheritance gets invested. Even $15 a week is so, so, so much better than $0 and ""meh, I'll worry about retirement when I earn enough for it to make a difference"" (it probably makes a difference to the tune of about $400k if you do it consistently until you retire!)",7k for 2024*,This is still better than intel grandma just sayin,"1) pay off any debt 2) build an emergency fund in a HYSA 3) open a Roth IRA and invest in a low cost index fund as long as you are earning income.

investing,Dec,1hbw55s,What‚Äôs the bullish case for AMD at this point?,"Long-time investor in AMD who‚Äôs beginning to seriously question the company‚Äôs relevancy at this point. In a year where tech has been dominating, it‚Äôs eye opening that AMD is down nearly 14% on the year. What gives? What, if anything, are investors missing? Is there a strong bullish case for the company or is this becoming an Intel story?","AMD wiped Intel in the lucrative data center space and will continue to gain from Intel's remaining market share. In this space, AMD is the undisputed champion.  AMD ramped their first AI product (MI300X) from $0 to $5 billion in the first year. The hardware capability of the AI accelerator (most difficult challenge imo) is comparable or better than that of NVDA's H100. The main obstacles are matching the network and software stacks, both in which AMD has made significant strides. In my opinion, AMD is the closest to NVDA among all AI hardware companies",AMD is the only competitor to Intel's CPUs. Look at market share of the global CPU industry. Hint: its a joke.   78% is Intel  13% is AMD  8% is Apple.  1% is other.  With Intel fumbling and failing at every corner for the past 20 years its a matter of time before they lose market share. Apple exclusively produces and uses CPUs for their own tech so they're out. So either some &lt;1% of market share company comes from absolutely nowhere or AMD takes over.  In my mind with Intel failing AMD is purposely spending tons on capital to build up for a coming demand for CPUs that don't overheat and fail as often as all of Intel's newest CPUs. So their P/E might be crazy high but that's not necessarily a bad thing imo.   AMD has been greatly improving all of their CPUs and Price to Performance beat Nvidia on a large section of GPUs. Nvidia might still be stronger so the industrial use of GPUs will remain dominated by Nvidia but the individual and potentially consumer products uses of GPUs have a lot of opportunity for AMD.,Not in new sales,&gt; AMD wiped Intel in the lucrative data center space  Despite all the intel hate -- Intel still holds the majority of the market share in this space,The PC upgrade cycle is another good reason. AMD looks to me to be a good long term investment.,"PE is high because of amortization of the XLNX acquisition, not because the profit is low. If you look at the non-GAAP earnings, it's a day and night difference.","Investing is forward looking, and clearly investors aren't expecting intel to continue to hold onto their market share, much less expand it","Dude, no it's not. You need to look at non-GAAP here, because the amortization from XLNX distorts the GAAP p/e. It's not really an indicator of how the business is doing. Forward P/E is like 25.   This is why it's important to understand how these numbers are calculated and read earnings reports and not just read google.",Up 213% the last 5 years. Surely it will perform well for another 5.,"&gt; With Intel fumbling and failing at every corner for the past 20 years its a matter of time before they lose market share.   This is my argument against AMD, as a matter of fact. They've had a decade to take over against a company that does more things wrong than right, and haven't. I don't think it's a matter of time, I think that time has passed and unless AMD does something dramatically different (like convince smug CIOs that they make better chips than Intel so all these companies who have Intel-only purchasing rules will buy AMD), it's just not going to happen.   The only thing that's going to have AMD taking over the desktop and server CPU market at this point is Intel literally not making chips."

investing,Dec,1hnxzwl,Sell rentals and invest in stocks?,I have a rental portfolio that generates about $50k after all income taxes and debt payments.  If I sold the portfolio I'd walk away with about $1 million to invest after all capital gains taxes are paid.   Does it make sense to sell the rentals and invest the proceeds? Seems like it wouldn't be hard to beat a 5% return in the market.,"The rates of return aren't exactly directly comparable.  Rentals are more of a blend of growth and income, where stocks are generally more growth-oriented.  Whether or not the cash flow is useful will depend on the specifics of the rentals, and your personal tax situation.    Housing appreciation is also magnified by the cheap leverage that a mortgage provides - leveraged ETFs and similar products are significantly less safe than mortgages.  Considering housing appreciation at 3% or so, but only requiring 20% LTV is 5 to 1 leverage, which is more like a 15% return on the actual money you have invested.  Its important to consider that leverage in the math as well.",Very realistic to beat 5% in the market and you don't have the risk of destructive tenants or other such problems.,"That‚Äôs exactly what I plan on doing once all my current tenant‚Äôs leases are up. They‚Äôve doubled in value, I can very likely make a better rate of return in the market, I don‚Äôt have to worry about the rentals, and I‚Äôm trying to simplify my life. Time to cash out.","On the flip side you do have the risk of sudden capital and income loss across your entire stock portfolio.      There are risks with every approach though, so that is why I prefer a reasonably diversified strategy including stocks (index trackers and some hand picked stocks), property and land.","Yeah as this comment and one above references, you can definitely get higher nominal returns via equities, but it‚Äôs a different risk profile. Yes, less execution risk in terms of a tenant causing problems, but also, equities could go through 20-30-40% drawdowns fairly frequently‚Ä¶something that probably won‚Äôt happen with housing. So higher return but also higher volatility","True. But there is nothing wrong with a dual channel approach. I think the two complement each other a great deal. Real estate properly done gives you a lot of right offs to offset your gains in the market. Yes you can get 10% in the market. But unless it is tax sheltered you must deal with capital gains taxes., or dividend taxation. You might want to run the numbers before you bail. But you‚Äôre right your returns on your current property are not good. But you could either pull equity out and get into some better investment property, do a 1031, or sell and redeploy to better yielding property. You may have gotten a bad taste in your mouth for real estate because you got into some bad deals.",You already have more than anyone needs; I don‚Äôt see why you would want to task risks. If you already have a stock portfolio then don‚Äôt do anything otherwise you could sell some property and start one but I would say diversify.,"What is your cost basis on the rental property? What do you think you can sell for? There are ways you can mitigate tax liability while investing. If your net worth outside of your primary residence is in excess of $1million, then you are considered an accredited investor. Assuming you do qualify, this will enable you to invest in a way that will significantly reduce your tax burden.   You can also 1031 out of your current rental into other real estate investments to diversify out of just one asset. When you do a 1031 it is a common misconception that you have to turn around and buy a single piece of property. You could roll your gains into multiple properties or even mineral rights (oil/natural gas).   There are also Qualified Opportunity Zones created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that give you the ability to invest capital gains, defer taxes, meanwhile any gains that you accrue are free of taxes if you hold that investment for 10 years.   Honestly there are some questions that need to be addressed and many different ways to implement these and other strategies to mitigate taxes selling your rental.   For more info: https://www.thetaxefficientadvisor.com/tax-efficient-tools",I would not. Real estate is about as solid as it gets. You can very easily get by on that rental income assuming you own the place you live in. Not only are you getting the $50k income every year but the property should also go up in value over time.  If you really want to invest then I would start an account using your income. Or maybe just sell like 100k-200k of your real estate.  But If the rentals are your only source of income then selling them would be incredibly risky since you‚Äôd be giving up guaranteed money for the hope of at least matching the returns,That is massive that you are even considering what your cap rate is. I‚Äôve had several discussions with real estate investors that had no idea what their cap rates even were. When we crunched the numbers they were looking at 2-3% returns because their property had increased exponentially in value where rent did not increase as dramatically. In their case I showed them that they could liquidate their rentals and dramatically improve their cash flow once they redeployed the proceeds in a diversified portfolio.

My reasoning is as follows: I think there will be a slowdown in U.S. and global stocks in the future, as today their earnings have not kept up with the soaring prices of stocks. This is reflected in an extremely high PE ratio compared to historical averages. However, with a contraction in household spending, I don't believe corporate earnings will rise, and as a result, stock prices should decrease in order to reach a more reasonable ad close  PE.

So you could do 80-90% in spy, then invest the rest in either something you believe in for personal reasons, or an area that you think will beat SPY for the next 5-10 years.¬†  Another option is to put half the money into SPY, and put the rest in a money market earning about 4.5% right now. Then each month move some from the money market into SPY. This is ultimately a hedge against a large drop in the market which could happen at any time. Putting a large sum of money into the stock market and seeing it go down can be stressful. To the point you can‚Äôt sleep or eat. If you don‚Äôt know your risk tolerance, I recommend this approach. Imagine your portfolio going down 40% in the next month. If that scares the shit out of you, then you probably want to ease into investing a little bit.¬†  What I like about this approach is that if the market goes up, your portfolio is growing. If the market goes down, then you can continue buying SPY over time at a lower rate. All while making sure you are good with the risk. Ultimately, 100k at 20 years old is a great sum of money and can really set you up as long as you leave it in there long term and don‚Äôt start spending it on something dumb (like a new car).¬†  Another option is to throw $7k into a Roth IRA account right now, then another $7k in January (as long as you have an income high enough that allows you to). Then invest all that money into SPY in that account so that when you retire, you don‚Äôt pay taxes on those gains. $14k invested today at 10% return is a million dollars when you are 65.¬†  Congrats on the inheritance","I am not an expert, but yes I think it's sensible to put the lions share of your funds in the strongest historically performing and business friendly country. I'm Canadian, and I still have more in the U.S. than at home.  I have, myself, put very little into emerging markets because of the historical performance (volatility) and scandals and frauds and hyperinflation of those markets.  Just too much systemic corruption and individual corruption.   I'd rather make investments in the s&amp;p and double my money on average of every 7 years with a moderate amount of volatility, than invest in companies that promise to double every 4 and then every once in awhile go **right to zero**.",You could just buy VT,"People saying the market will drop don‚Äôt know. Banks are forecasting 10% increase in S&amp;P in 2025, more than what many forecasted this year as the market will likely reach +30%.  You‚Äôre 20? Put it all in S&amp;P. Forget foreign stocks. If you want, put some in on small cap value, which should perform well in 2025 as the bull market continues.  So, either 100% VOO or 50/50 or so VOO/AVUV (or similar).","This captures my thoughts exactly.

Since I've posted these, the stock has bubbled up \~200%. I am doubling down.  In my final DD for this stock, I will explain how national security concerns present another roadblock for QUBT investors (you really should've quit this stock by now though).  # The China Connection  [The China Connection](https://preview.redd.it/itzzdx3hql9e1.jpg?width=185&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f9c12eabe1a3d9c95054eced0674e6b49f2330e)  Quantum computing is a key US national security priority because of its applications to encryption, communications, and logistics. QUBT is clearly trying to pitch itself into US government procurement roles, most notably their [5th NASA contract](https://www.inflation.us/content/peak-stupidity-qubt-worth-26b-26000-nasa-contract) (better described as a proof of concept agreement) for $26,000 which you can read [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/quantum-computing-inc-awarded-contract-by-nasa-to-support-phase-unwrapping-using-dirac-3-photonic-optimization-solver-302333581.html).  **Senior QUBT are foreign nationals that will struggle to get security clearances**  As detailed in my previous posts, QUBT has very few technical staff, and of those, the majority are foreign nationals. To work on major government contracts, these QUBT staff members will need to gain security clearances, which will include questioning on foreign citizenship, ties and contacts with other nations, length of habitation in the US and so on. Gaining top level security clearances (which high value quantum computing use cases will require) will be especially hard if they are from countries that the United States is not allied with. See below:  * Yuping Huang - Chief Quantum Officer (China) * Yong Meng Sua - Chief Technical Officer (Malaysia) * Guangju Zhang - Senior optical engineer (China) * Yichen Ma - Quantum Nanophotonics engineer (China) * He Zhang - Quantum Tech Lead (China) * Lac Nguyen - Quantum Tech Lead (Vietnam) * Milan Begliarbekov - Foundry Director (likely former USSR) * There are about 5 more of Chinese descent (but I can't view their background through Linkedin), as well as another 4 of Indian birth (but Elon said that was OK)  Now whether you like it or not, their backgrounds, particularly in Trump's America, will impede their ability to gain key government contracts in ways that don't apply to Google, Rigetti or IonQ.  Are they spies or foreign assets? I don't know, but it's the **risk profile** and **perception that matters** for a clearance, not whether they've actually committed any wrongdoing.  # Could they actually be linked to hostile governments?  Potentially yes.   **Background**  In the past 15 years, [China](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-quantum/) is increasingly investing in quantum computing related espionage.  And as the private sector becomes more difficult for Chinese intelligence to operate in with impunity,[ college campuses ](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/china-focuses-espionage-on-u-s-colleges-and-universities)have become a more attractive avenue for obtaining critical U.S. secrets.  As detailed in my previous posts, almost all the quantum computing specialists at QUBT either currently work or formerly worked/studied at the otherwise unremarkable Steven's Institute of Technology in Heboken, New Jersey.  **Stevens Institute and Chinese Money**  Between 1st July 2012 and 30 June 2015 ([see February 2024 data](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/topics/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-reporting/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-data) \- snippet below) , the Stevens Institute operated a $500 000 dollar contract funded from an undisclosed **Chinese** source with receipt date on the 30th of June 2013. Similarly, for the same exact contract and receipt dates, they received another $500 000 dollar contract from an undisclosed Malaysian source, as well as another $300 000 contract from an undisclosed Dominican Republic source. Unlike other gifts and contracts that are listed on government records for Stevens, I am unable to find any other public sources starting what these funds were used for or where they were from.  Interestingly, if these contracts were from the same source, splitting it across three sources and over three years would allow them to go under the $250 000 annual threshold that requires mandatory reporting to the US Government under [Section 117 of the Higher Education Act](https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/topics/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-reporting), and hence avoid triggering greater government scrutiny.  |University|Type|Country|Amount¬†|Receipt|Start|End| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Stevens Institute of Technology|Contract|CHINA|$500,000|30/06/2013|1/07/2012|30/6/2015| |Stevens Institute of Technology|Contract|DOMINICAN REPUBLIC|$300,000|30/06/2013|1/07/2012|30/6/2015| |Stevens Institute of Technology|Contract|MALAYSIA|$500,000|30/06/2013|1/07/2012|30/6/2015|  **Stevens Institute and Chinese Collaboration**  Bucking the trend of American universities ending collaboration with Chinese institutions, the Stevens Institute has increased them. This includes a recent agreements with the [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/china-focuses-espionage-on-u-s-colleges-and-universities), [Zijing education](https://www.stevens.edu/zijing-partnership), [Beacon University](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/beacon-education-announces-partnership-with-stevens-institute-of-technology-301887815.html).  Furthermore, in 2019, [the Stevens institute](https://thestute.com/2019/11/08/chinese-offered-as-a-foreign-language-for-the-first-time-at-stevens-next-semester/) added Chinese language classes to its offering for the first time and the university currently ranks [12th ](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/universities-highest-percentage-international-students)out of all American universities for share of foreign students.  Now of course this isn't evidence of any wrongdoing, but Chinese authorities [keep a close watch](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/05/china-overseas-students-face-harassment-and-surveillance-in-campaign-of-transnational-repression/) on its students in the US, which gives it a large pool of potential assets to target.  # Yuping Huang  This name just keeps coming up over and over again. He's a professor at the Stevens Institute, he's on the board of QUBT, he's their chief quantum officer, he's developed almost all of their patents, he works on photonics, computing, chip design, this whole company depends on **YUPING HUANG**.  So I tell myself I've got to understand this guy, otherwise I'm never going to understand this company. That begins with looking at his publication record, which ultimately underpins the value of the company's patents, and hence the company's commercial viability.  **Yuping Huangs publication record**  Citation Farming is the practice of artificially boosting the number of citations to certain research papers or studies to create an inflated sense of their importance or credibility. In the context of industrial espionage, generating a network of heavily cross-referenced or fabricated studies, espionage actors can create a false research landscape that directs competitors toward unproductive efforts, establishes fake reputations for gaining insider access, or serves as a cover for extracting sensitive information under the guise of legitimate collaboration.  Below I have generated a table of the top papers that Yuping Huang has led authorship over the past 12 years (as well as two papers where Yong Meng Sua was the lead author -  with Yuping Huang as coauthor). These papers, which on face value have a modest number of citations, suddenly looks much less impressive when you look at where the citations come from. A major source of Huang's citation come from either himself (which is counted here) and researchers from Stevens/QUBT (some of which are not counted here, so I'm actually undercounting the issue here!). The second major source of citations come from Chinese researchers, some of which are okay, but also many that do not come with significant publishing profiles.  This is important because their research underpins QUBT's patents, and hence their chances of actually making any breakthroughs. It's clear that much of their publishing background occurs in an echo chamber inside the Stevens institute, where researchers are able to cite one another repeatedly and juice up their citation counts. Additionally there is the second element that a suspiciously large number of their citations come from Chinese researchers.  So I see two possibilities. One is that their quantum technology is junk that has been developed in an echo chamber and hence has no value. Or two, their quantum technology is junk AND some of their employees are Chinese assets.  |Paper|Total Citations|Self Citation|Chinese author citation|Total China Connection Index| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |[Mode-resolved photon counting via cascaded quantum frequency conversion](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5332862874783526088&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005)|54|26%|13%|39%| |[Heralding single photons without spectral factorability](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14620412413267770728&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005)|45|31%|18%|49%| |[Interaction-free all-optical switching in œá (2) microdisks for quantum applications](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6076153232367925890&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005)|40|40%|28%|68%| |[Quantum frequency conversion in nonlinear microcavities](https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-38-12-2119)|37|8%|43%|51%| |[Direct generation and detection of quantum correlated photons with 3.2 um wavelength spacing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17820-1)|41|29%|17%|46%| |[Ultra-wideband and high-gain parametric amplification in telecom wavelengths with an optimally mode-matched PPLN waveguide](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=wGxd5zcAAAAJ&amp;pagesize=100&amp;citation_for_view=wGxd5zcAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC)|34|18%|35%|53%|",See ya behind the dumpster at Wendys,"This is a solid DD and you‚Äôre 100% right, if we like it or not foreign nationals having ties like this are not gonna cut it on DOD backgrounds","So we can triple our money by doing the exact opposite of your  so called analysis, is that the moral of the story?",A true quantum investor is both a bull and a bear simultaneously....,"You commitment to the short is solid, you are a real quantum bear.","as a huge On Cinema at the Cinema fan, imagine my surprise seeing this image in the investing subreddit.","These contract dollars are absolutely piddly, though - is there more to it?

This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*  I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general.   **Investment strategy:**  1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*   2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*   3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*   4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*  I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.  **Looking forward:**  Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies.

But it is also a cyclical industry. And if you don't know when the cycle starts or ends, you may overpay for a strong business.

It‚Äôs mostly cosmetic added complexity (click-to-expand drop downs and pop up boxes) whereas a simple user display with good usage of space would suffice.,"Vanguard used to be a fine choice for beginner investors with a small pot. Now that Vanguard is introducing a minimum account fee, they are not so appealing. For example, a ¬£48 yearly fee on a ¬£10k pot is 0.48%, making them one of the more expensive brokers.  Assuming you're opening an S&amp;S ISA, Trading212 and InvestEngine are the cheapest as they have no platform or trading fees.

Why are you just restating the OP's comment?,"&gt; a ¬£48 yearly fee on a ¬£10k pot is 0.48%  But since it's a fixed fee, it goes down as a **percentage** as your account grows -- and I think this is a good system.  There are a certain amount of fixed COSTS that they bear for each customer, and this is a better way of covering them than charging one person ¬£2 and another ¬£200 for essentially the same service.  How long will your account stay at ¬£10K?  How long will it take you to get to ¬£20K or ¬£40K, where your fee **as a percentage** drops to 0.24 and then 0.12?  You probably won't pay 0.48% for more than one year ... right?"

investing,Dec,1hgin1e,"Maxed out my Roth IRA at beginning of year but will make more than $161,000","Exactly as the title says.   I just read that you can make full contributions if you make up to $146,000 and partial up to $161,000. I‚Äôm already past that point and have made $156,000. My next check will put me over + bonuses.   Are these limits gross or net? Can I just put more in my 401k?   What are my options? I‚Äôve heard of a back door, and also a mega back door, but not sure what they mean or if I‚Äôm able to do it considering I‚Äôve contributed all of this at the beginning of the year.

Any help would be greatly appreciated as we‚Äôre getting close to the end of the year and I‚Äôm getting a bit nervous. Thanks!","If you exceed the threshold, you need to do a backdoor Roth contribution if you want Roth.  1. Get your institution to **recharacterize** this year's contribution as a traditional contribution. This is probably a phone call. You'll pay some tax on any gains, but it should be minimal.  2. Get your institution to **convert** your now traditional contribution to Roth. This is probably a click in the UI.  Going forward, always contribute as traditional then convert to Roth. You can't put more than the IRS limit in your 401k.",Don't forget the pro rata rule if OP has money in a traditional IRA already,"it should be the amount you made AFTER pre tax deductions (401, health insurance, ETC). google MAGI and see what qualifes but look at the amount you made after contributing to your 401 and if possible put more into that in order to qualify.",This is HUGE,"Ohhhhh!!!!

I'm with fidelity if that matters","Related question - if my contribution to my 401k puts me below $141k total income for the year, I‚Äôm ok with having a Roth IRA right?","Definitely not all plans allow excess contributions. It‚Äôs plan-specific. Many plans will simply stop deducting when you get to the limit, which also might mean they stop making matching contributions (again, depending on the plan - some will true-up the match at the end of the year if you max out early).","This is from Fidelity: ‚ÄúThen you subtract tax credits, adjustments, and deductions.

investing,Dec,1hi9ff4,Inherited 100k in stocks.,"I (29M) was recently surprised when I received a letter in the mail explaining I would be receiving an inheritance. This week I finally received the funds and it ended up being a little over 100k. Most of the money is currently in stocks. I have 762 shares of Pfizer, 708 shares of Exxon, 94 shares of Viatris, and 16 shares of Bristol Myers Squibb. Exxon and Pfizer I am familiar with, however, I have never heard of Viatris or Bristol Myers. The only other investments I currently have is an employer matched 401k I have been contributing to. After doing some research I believe there are better places where I can put this money to work more for me in the long run. What are some opinions you guys have in terms of what to possibly do with this money in order for me to get the best possible outcome in the future?","Make sure they stepped up the cost basis to date of death. Talk to a tax pro. Call Fidelity or vanguard so they can walk you through it. Even if you don‚Äôt have them manage it for you, they are trust worthy and will explain. Sorry for your loss. Good luck.","Index funds/ETFs because better performing stocks often become under performing stocks. Unless your Warren Buffet, you almost certainly do not know what a better performing stock is, and should just buy an index.","As a Pfizer owner, I‚Äôd sell it and buy VOO.","I should of mentioned this money came from a trust fund. According to the letter I received the cost basis dates back as much as 26 years. All together the equities equaled to $1,284,519.79. The cumulative cost basis for those equities was $669,288.36. Overall, the unrealized gains were $615,231.36. The trust was irrevocable and because of this the securities were distributed in kind between me and a few others. I opened up a Fidelity brokerage account in order for me to acquire my shares.","Sorry for whatever loss lead to you inheriting these, but it can be a nice silver lining.  Not knowing how exactly these came into your possession and whatever brokerage, I'd say something to double check is that the cost basis is whatever value they held on the day that the owner passed away. So whatever capital gains or losses for *you* are relative to that, not when they were originally purchased - which is a big deal come tax time!  As far as what to do with it, that depends on your financial situation and goals.   That's a pretty good chunk towards the down payment on a house if that's something that's on your radar. Maybe the difference between a 30-year and 15-year mortgage, who knows.  You could liquidate those positions to cash and then invest them in some sort of long-term holding. I don't know if you already have a personal brokerage account or not, so you might already be aware of this, but unlike your 401k, an individual taxable account does mean that you have to pay taxes on any distributed earnings. Choices to make there; you might allocate things differently between a taxable and tax-advantaged account.",Yes!  Avoid sector funds.  Don't chase performance.  No one knows which sectors will outperform any more than we know which individual stocks will outperform.  Invest in total-market funds.,I second Fidelity.  They have excellent customer service and will help every step of the way.,"Oooh okay that is very pertinent information. And admittedly this is outside my personal experience of having inherited someone's investment holdings upon death.  But, in your Fidelity account you should be able to go into your account positions and see the cost basis for each individual stock and how much gain (or loss!!) each position is. Take a close look at what those are.  It's worth thinking about what you want to do here, because you will have to pay taxes on anything that's a gain relative to its cost basis when you sell it, *but it's possible that some of these might be more neutral or even a loss, which could get you a tax break for the year you sell them.*  Big difference come tax time between ""You owe Uncle Sam"" versus ""Uncle Sam owes you.""  But let's say you kept it simple and sold it all to reinvest elsewhere. In that case you'd presumably have $50k of realized gains and then have to pay long term capital gains tax, which is probably no more than 15% for you, but that's still an additional $7500 you pay in taxes.  Individual stocks versus ETFs or mutual funds or whatever else, that's something to think about. Personal opinion but an index fund or ETF is hard to go wrong with on the long term. Less thinking involved re: analyzing individual securities.  But again, take a close look at the things you're holding, their cost basis, what might be worth selling now and what perhaps might be worth holding onto.","I hold Viatris, I can explain. Pfizer had a division called Upjohn which made drugs whose patents had expired. They sold that division off in 2019 and it then merged with Mylan, an international generic drug company. The resulting company, Viatris, does a combination of generics and off-patent drugs that still have name recognition. If you insist on name-brand Xanax, Lyrica, or Viagra, they have it.   Bristol Meyers Squibb - Another pharma. Older readers probably know the OTC they used to offer like Excedrin and Ban deodorant. They‚Äôve since sold those product lines off. I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôd recognize any of their current names, which is kind of a mixed blessing; no blockbusters means less of a cliff when the patent on that blockbuster expires.","""should have"", not ""should of"""

The idea revolves around tracking high-frequency trades and institutional buying patterns. I came across a community that provides alerts based on this data, and I‚Äôve managed to pull off some decent gains following their insights. For example, they tipped me off about a biotech stock that shot up 80% in just a week (wish I had put more into it).  It got me thinking - how viable is this kind of strategy for retail investors in the long run? Has anyone else tried using institutional-level data or similar tools to guide their trades?

investing,Dec,1hgob40,Discussion: Are Small Caps and International Stocks Set to Outperform in 2025?,"Is anyone here selling growth for small caps or international stocks heading into 2025? In my long-term, non-gambling portfolio, I‚Äôm considering selling half of my VOO/VUG to buy into VB and VXUS  In the post covid world, index fund investors have been rewarded for sticking with QQQ/Mag7. But I‚Äôve been noticing more calls (Tom Lee etc) suggesting small caps and international stocks could finally be set to outperform. With valuations relatively attractive and some macro factors (like a potential soft landing and interest rate shifts) playing into their favor, it‚Äôs got me wondering:  Is anyone reallocating your portfolio toward small caps or international stocks? Why or why not?  What catalysts do you think could drive outperformance in these areas?  Are there any specific sectors or regions (emerging markets, Europe, etc.) you‚Äôre watching closely?  I don‚Äôt have any links but this topic has been on CNBC/stock market YouTube lately. What are you positions heading into the new year?",I‚Äôm as ‚ÄúVT and chill‚Äù as they come and I genuinely don‚Äôt understand an investing subreddit where people downvote discussion threads on investing topics and reply with comments like ‚Äúno one has a crystal ball‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt time the market‚Äù.

Small-caps have underperformed for this reason. Unless venture capital money goes away, small-cap stocks won‚Äôt perform at the same level at large-cap stocks in the future","That's why the play isn't small caps, but small cap value. Venture capital doesn't usually go for boring small companies.","Nobody knows.  Academic investing theory would say that US large caps have lower expected future returns compared to US small caps and international. However the market does not exclusively follow academic behavior.

What happens when that American protectionism leads to retaliation? Suddenly Apple isn't selling phones in China anymore.   People in those countries might start finding alternatives to the US businesses they've been buying from,"My theory is that small caps don‚Äôt do as well anymore because of private equity.

What are the smartest things to do to prepare for such a sale?  If im required to sell what is the best way to minimize taxes on that money or how do I ensure I leave the table with the most money.  Also, curious after taxes what could I do with that money to make it work for me.  I'm currently employed so I'd be ok parking that money somewhere and letting it sit and grow if that's the best path forward.

I haven't really found a good professional that I feel has given me good advice.,"It sounds like that wealth manager gave you great advice.

investing,Dec,1hjq9lc,Why invest in MSTR instead of directly buying BTC?,"I understand that some countries have strict restrictions on investing in BTC, and MSTR is essentially BTC with leverage. However, I don‚Äôt think these two reasons are convincing enough. At the very least, I can buy BTC on Coinbase and freely set my desired leverage, right?","You'd be betting on their ability to keep using their access to credit markets to acquire BTC more efficiently than you otherwise could, increase BTC per share, and eventually do something interesting with their massive holdings as BTC adoption matures.   I think they'll probably do very well and could have some upside vs BTC. But I also think it's a very different risk profile. Where BTC is a bearer asset with basically no counterparty risk, MSTR is very reliant on Saylor continuing to make good decisions and staying solvent. God knows what happens if Saylor dies and gets replaced with some random suit.",I agree.  I would invest directly in bitcoin.,What could possibly go wrong?,The fee you pay when buying mstr is a 200% premium per btc,"Because people don't know how to buy BTC, and exchanges actually charge a lot too.","BTC is less volatile than MSTR and MSTR is a security, meaning that all the usual mechanism of hedging and speculation just fit nicely into it. I don't think you can buy an SEC protected BTC leveraged put expiring in 3 hours, for example, but if you want to do that with MSTR, you can.  The market has a lot of very short term movers that feel safer doing what they do everyday in a known system. It's an open door into bitcoin for professional investors, without needing to address your funds' internal rules (or create investor fear by moving into full crypto holding).  The fact that all of this is happening close to bonus period is not an accident.",The absolutely negligible fees on BTC ETFs has gotten rid of this as a reason - I see companies like MSTR continuing to lose lustre given the mass institutional buy-ins into these ETFs,So because of the transaction fee you would rather buy stock in a company that buys Bitcoin rather than buy the actual Bitcoin itself? You're just trading no fees for higher risk and greater potential for loss.,"Stocks often trade on ideas.  The conceptual idea behind MSTR is that you can spend $1 to buy 30c worth of Bitcoin, but if the company raises more equity or debt to buy Bitcoin (say, raising 20c to buy 20c of Bitcoin), the number of Bitcoins per share increases. Investors in MSTR are convinced this is valuable growth because the company talks about this in their BTC Yield KPI, and thus believe it should trade at a multiple of the underlying holdings (say 3x).  As long as people out there believe this, then it is possible the company could raise money and get re-rated upwards, leading to the stock to rise.  My guess is it eventually collapses when people realise that this doesn't actually create any value, and ignores the fact you're spending $1 for 30c of Bitcoin in the first place. True believers (existing holders) will dismiss it because the strategy is working for them, so it'll likely take a period of underperformance before people start to lose faith, and then it'll collapse.","MSTR is not Bitcoin. MSTR is equity in a company that offers financial products with fixed income qualities backed by Bitcoin. They will continuously buy Bitcoin as long as this ‚ÄúBitcoin-upside‚Äù powered fixed income is desirable.   While the convertible notes have limited upside potential, their downside is limited as well. There is no capital loss with these bonds.   This causes the equity side of the equation to act in a leveraged way. The upside potential is unlimited with the equity, but the downside potential enhanced as well.   Ultimately, I see Bitcoin becoming a multimillion dollar asset. I also see MSTR splitting multiple times 10 to 1 and doing incredible multiples.   I wouldn‚Äôt consider buying both diversification. The issue is you can‚Äôt hold your own keys in a IRA."
