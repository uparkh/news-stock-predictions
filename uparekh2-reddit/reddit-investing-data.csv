investing,Jan,18w135n,10 years of actually caring.,"Ten years ago I was 24 and much stupider than I am today.  I spent the majority of my late teens / early 20's partying and blowing through money like I had plenty of it (I didn't).  Ten years ago today I made a promise and decided to start saving money, for retirement and just for personal security in general.[Here are the results.](https://i.imgur.com/L6TbHLv.png)Pretty self-explanatory, but the left column is the January 1st balance, right column is December 31st, and middle in the amount contributed throughout the year.  This is a combination of three different accounts; TSP (I'm active duty), VFIFX, and a brokerage account.  The large sums of contributions in 2016 and 2020 was money I had saved up from deployments, every other year was just what I could afford to shovel away while not having to eat PB&amp;J every meal.I guess that's the entire post; it feels good to have turned my life around and started to care about life years from now, both for myself and my family.  I don't make a TON of money, around 80k a year, so it's possible to build a significant retirement in a relatively short period of time without being a lawyer / doctor / IT professional / etc.  Happy New Year to everyone!",There's nothing a V6 Mustang at 24% APR can't fix.,&gt;active dutyYou sure you wouldn't be happier with a nice sports car rather than a healthy retirement account?,"Awesome ! Too often at a young age people confuse ""investing"" with ""gambling. As you demonstrate, it is a building process with goals and safe guards. You have held yourself accountable for you future, BRAVO!",I got one word for you son... thundercougarfalconbird,"EXCELLENT work.  You are sitting around where I was at your age.  Maybe a little better.  I kept it up for 30 years after that and I am retired with a $2.2 million net worth.  There will be bumps on the road, maybe big ones (I'm looking at you 2008), but keep on saving.","As a 25 y/o just getting into investing, this is motivating to see what my next 10 years could look like if I stay diligent and focus on a plan. Congratulations and thank you for the great post!","Almost every major military base in the United States has Dodge, GM, and Ford dealerships damn near walking distance from them for a reason.",Partying and blowing money in your 20s. Who hasn‚Äôt üò¨. I‚Äôm 35 now and unfortunately i only saw the light at 29. Nice to see your chart üìä,"This post has helped me realize I can own a gt3rs in 10 years, thanks","Make sure you get the luxury edition, it has so much more eagle"
investing,Jan,1986gm2,Musk Demands Bigger Stake in Tesla as Price for A.I. Work,"Elon Musk, the electric car company‚Äôs chief executive, said he would ‚Äúbuild products outside of Tesla‚Äù unless the board raises his stake to 25 percent (approximately $80B).He neglected to mention what exact AI products he's referring to. Not sure if Grok is worth $80,000,000,000.[NYT reports here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/business/tesla-elon-musk-stock.html)","I, too, will build products outside of Tesla if I am not given $80,000,000,000.",So you try to blackmail me with money? I have 3 words for you. Go. Fuck. Yourself.,"‚ÄúRefund me for my ill-advised Twitter adventure because it‚Äôs not fun anymore or otherwise I‚Äôll directly compete with the company I own.‚ÄùDios mio, Elon is such worm shit.  Can any of you investors here imagine having that kind of temerity?","&gt; A stake of less than 15 percent of the company, Mr. Musk said, ‚Äúmakes a takeover by dubious interests too easy.‚ÄùWait, wait, don't tell me, but I think I've seen this happen before.",It‚Äôs amazing to me that he lacks the self awareness to realize he **is** the dubious interests,"I promise not to make any products outside of Tesla if you give me $40,000,000,000.Now that is a bargain.",Not mentioned in this article is that this sort of behavior totally violates his fiduciary duties to the company and shareholders as CEO of Tesla.,I'm so ready to hear nothing about him ever again. He should strap in and head off to Mars asap imo.,"[Archived link](https://archive.is/QdKY9)Most outlets are reporting Musk demanded equity in the company.His actual statement is asking for 25% minimum voting control, which is bad enough that it doesn't need to be embellished by saying he's demanding an $80B payment.See other companies like Alphabet and Meta for excessive board influence from CEOs/executives.",Is that fair? I hope it is.
investing,Jan,193kjjs,US SEC approves 11 spot bitcoin ETFs,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, including those of Grayscale, Bitwise and Hashdex, according to a statement on Wednesday.Source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sec-approves-some-spot-bitcoin-etfs-2024-01-10/",Just as satoshi envisioned,I remember someone on here months ago saying he would eat a sock if the SEC approved a bitcoin spot etf. I kind of feel bad for him now.,Big win for coinbase as well. Coinbase is custodian for 8/11 of the etfs apparently.,Congratulations bitcoin investors!,Years ago? More like always has and still does!,Can‚Äôt believe I am seeing bitcoin related post on r/investing that‚Äôs more unbelievable than the ETF itself!,Bought some ETH and BTC back in May 2021. Glad I'm finally breaking even today lol,The ETF is regulated. Can't regulate bitcoin. It is free and open.,Lol,We have coke full circle. Decentralized currency abstracted into stocks bought and sold with centralized currency.
investing,Jan,1938sv1,AI is going to change DD and trading.,"In 1998 the SEC authorized electronic exchanges; at that exact moment high frequency/algorithmic trading was born. This completely changed traditional trading forever as everyone here knows.        Everyone here who is doing TA is effectively competing against hedge funds / trading firms (**\*cough Jane Street, renaissance, etc\***) that hired former MiT math Olympiads to deploy quant models to pattern recognize better than any simple bot you'll find on github can.      This is obvious. I'm not making this post to talk about chart analysis, but rather I think we're going to see a similar shift happen that we saw in 1998 and it will happen that impacts the traditional financial markets. I think we're going to start to reach a point in the near future where much of the due diligence process is completely automated by language models. For instance, I came across [this the other day](https://mindy.com). It's an AI founded by the founding team of paypal/youtube that you email and can ask questions about anything and it autonomously researches on the Internet and compiles data. I had it specifically research the financials of stocks that I've manually been keeping up with and I was genuinely shocked at the accuracy and didn't realize how rapidly this was progressing. This is something that's accessible right now, but so were basic algorithmic trading systems in the early days if you had basic programming experience. I don't think this will remain the case in the future and the knowledge gap between your average trader and an institutional trader will be more pronounced than it already is. Trading systems will be able to factor in news sources, look across hundreds of different financials, C suite profiles, etc. and figure out what and what not to invest it and when to pull out. It will know when to ""buy the rumor"" and ""sell the news"". Private equity firms are already doing this in the private markets, it's something Blackstone has actively talked about. It's just a matter of time before it becomes advanced enough to do all of this.      AI is something that will be used by all of us to expedite basic research. If you're doing fundamental analysis, use it to your benefit to do DD. If you're trading, realize that the game is about to get a lot more intense.","Lol this was really funny to read. I work at a bulge bracket on WS and this is literally what our bank is working on implementing with traders right now. To be fair, I already don't think your average part time day trader has a great chance if they're trying to do basic TA. You're competing with people that do this for a living. But yes, you're right it's going to get far more sophisticated but the systems will eventually even themselves out amongst the major players. Fundamental analysis is where this changes things. I think people will just create models to try and emulate successful investment strategies (eg buffet) at an extremely quick rate. My take: The little guy was already screwed if he was half assing trading anyways. AI will change fundamental analysis overall and help people rapidly find the best opportunities. You can have an LLM churn through thousands of financial reports in minutes, synthesize the results, and match investment criteria better than a human can.","Yes, agree on the last part. But the point is that these systems will begin to become so complex that someone sitting at home trying to trade based on chart patterns is done for more so than now. I do not think there will be clever tricks to outmaneuver bot trading patterns due to the sheer access of information new systems will have.",That's what a lot of the market is already. Automated trades where algorithms are reacting to movement created by other algorithms.,"You're already 10 years too late. Sophisticated AI models have already been trading on the market for a decade, and already make up a huge portion of the market volume. It's great that your LLM can do some DD for you, but you're competing against autonomous agents who already have that DD of every company in the planet in their data and are able to take millisecond responses against new news.Anyone who tries to do smart daily trading at this point is a fool. You wouldn't try to go up against AI in an art competition or writing or chess, why challenge it at the stock market? You will lose.","Will their models end up manipulating/influencing the market?  Then ending up with competing models , each having market impact,  fighting each other.","Too many people assume AI = consumer facing LLMs and think that ChatGPT is the starting point. Bespoke AI/ML models have been around for at least a decade and anyone with a large amount of resources has already been using them for a whilw. Hell, I was working on ML backed suggestion engines using TensorFlow back in 2018 at mid size companies no one has ever heard of and I'm a mediocre developer at best. Quant firms who pay their SWEs $400k out of college are probably doing things with AI that we can't even imagine.It's like looking at the military. The breakthroughs that the general public is allowed to see is stuff that has been around for 15 years. The true bleeding edge technology is kept secret because keeping it secret gives you an advantage over everyone else.","IMO no, if anything it makes DCA into index funds even better because if you tried stock picking you're now up against AI, MIT grads and full time investors. The people that will get hurt the most from this new flavor of AI will be the armchair part time day traders","A code leak is not the same as ""open sourced""","I think that's not hugely different than today.  Outsmarting the market has always been more of a gamble than actual strategy, that's why I pretty much only do low risk moderate return investing and just sit on it forever.  The little guy never wins in day trading",No one ever has access to the best tech because it's proprietary in nature in this context. Capital buys you the best talent and consequently buys you the best tech.
investing,Jan,18wa1ny,Twitter-backer knocks billions off its value after Musk‚Äôs ‚Äògo f--- yourself‚Äô outburst,"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-backer-knocks-billions-off-192028495.html&gt;An investor in Twitter has written down the value of its stake by $2.85bn (¬£2.2bn) after Elon Musk told boycotting advertisers to ‚Äúgo f‚Äî yourself‚Äù.Fidelity, which helped Mr Musk buy the company for $44bn (¬£35bn) in 2022, now believes the company is worth 71.5pc less than at the time of purchase.The US investment giant had already slashed the value of its investment by 65pc at the end of October but deepened the discount in November. It came in the same month that Twitter‚Äôs billionaire owner launched a tirade against advertisers.Speaking at a New York Times conference, Mr Musk claimed a boycott by advertisers was going to ‚Äúkill‚Äù the company, adding: ‚ÄúIf somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f--- yourself.‚ÄùApple, IBM and Disney are among the major brands to cut ties with the social media platform, amid concerns about lax moderation under Mr Musk and the billionaire‚Äôs freewheeling personal style.Fidelity‚Äôs valuation cut, which was first reported by Axios, gives the company a notional value of just $12.5bn and suggests Twitter has lost $2.85bn of worth in the eyes of Fidelity in just four weeks.The investment group, which contributed more than $300m to Mr Musk‚Äôs takeover, does not disclose how it values privately held companies. Other shareholders may value their stakes differently.However, Twitter‚Äôs own internal stock plan for staff valued the company at just $19bn in October ‚Äì less than half the sum Mr Musk paid for it.",Did Fidelity consult Earth before revising the value?,"It's honestly shocking to me that any major institutions at all were willing to gamble so much money on this ridiculous project. Like, I didn't expect Elon to fuck things up quite *this* horrendously, but it was still an *obviously* pointless endeavor driven almost entirely by vanity from the start and there was zero reason whatsoever to think this dude would have any idea at all about how to run a social media company.",It wasn't worth $44bn by the time the deal closed,"From my understanding several banks loaned Elon about 15 billion dollars to help raise funds for the buyout of twitterWhy, my understanding they wanted to ""develop"" some relationship with the worlds richest man, even if the deal isn't really profitable it creates a business relationship with the worlds richest man what in theory could lead to other businessThen Elon completely screwed them losing them billions of dollars, the banks haven't been able to sell the debt like they normally would and are left holding the bag. I am not a big Elon fan but I find him completely screwing the banks kind of funny.","It wasn't worth 44bn at any point, which is why he was dumb to offer to pay that.Now I'd be surprised if it's worth $10bn. Eventual bankruptcy seems inevitable.","All those institutions investing in Twitter were one of the things that happened in the last few years that really brought home the fact that ultimately, nobody really knows what they're doing. There isn't a meritocracy in a large scale sense, there is just a semi-random selection of people at the top.Buying an established social media company nearing the limits of its growth, at a time when interest rates were rising and the culture was shifting in general to other forms of social media. It wouldn't really have been a good idea regardless of who was doing it. Combine it with Musk's supposed mission and it made zero sense.",How long do you think it‚Äôll take people to truly understand how little Elon cares about investors,It was a mixture of facilities. Some part being Musk‚Äôs Tesla equity. The banks might be having the last laugh.,"Nailed it. A lot of these tech ""titans"" are guys born on third base who had one really good idea paired with the dumb luck of being in the right place at the right time. They're vaunted as gods and society as a whole for many years was willing to believe these guys should be allowed to decide the future of humanity. What is more frightening is that many of them seem to believe their own hype and are seen as their employers or fans as some kind of messiah. Fortunately a lot of them world is starting to see through them but not nearly fast enough.","The banks are getting their money, most likely. Musk is the one losing it."
investing,Jan,19egy4s,Do you still feel confident investing in Google after the obliteration of the search results?,"Pretty simple question, if you have been using Google the past few years you may have noticed how poor the results have become. Particularly in certain areas of the internet like 'local' where currently if you search for best x in city for 98% of terms you just get fed whatever Yelp, TripAdvisor, or YellowPages list has the best keyword match in their title regardless of how old or relevant the actual content is.5 to 10 years ago those results were filled with local newspapers, bloggers, tv stations, travel bloggers, and other small niche sites that actually had good boots on the ground info. Today they are just outdated lists that were often inaccurate from the start. Don't believe me? Google 'best craft stores in city' or 'best art supply stores in city' and replace the word city with any of the 10 through 200 biggest cities in the US.... I'll bet dollars to donuts you find those 3 sites I just mentioned and little else in the top 5.I know Google has all kinds of things going on with their company, I know the old search is dying (if not already dead) and AI results are coming, but at the end of the day search is Google's brand whether they want to admit it or not and for the last 3 or 4 years they have done nothing but go downhill in this regard.If they don't care about their main thing and don't mind wasting all of our time with awful results for years.... is that really a company you want to invest in? As both an SEO and a Google user you can guess where I land on this.","I ‚Äômember when results span hundreds of pages and I randomly picked page numbers (always quality gems hidden there).   I only google Reddit threads now. The search is basically ‚Äúbe buried under ads and we might through a Wikipedia in‚Äù. It‚Äôs shit.      But stock wise, we buy Alphabet (YouTube, Fitbit, cloud, advertising, teams, etc).   I‚Äôm at overperform on Alphabet for now.","Not sure why you're getting down voted. This is painfully accurate. I've noticed that they also keep shutting down new products. The cloud based video game service? Gone. Hangouts? Gone. Reader? Gone. Their search results have been absolute shit since chatgpt came out. If you have to search anything technical, you'll get the same 101 article rehashed by chatgpt on dozens of different sites. I have started using duckduckgo for programming queries. Sure, loads of people use kubernetes for devops, and kube came from Google. But it's not really a money maker for them. And most people go for AWS for devops operations over Google Cloud, despite the industry's reliance on kubernetes and how GC supposedly incorporates it better. Others have figured out a good email client by now. The phone service plan is great, but hardly anyone knows about it. IMHO, they're losing their niche. Slowly, but it's slipping. They've spent so long trying to break into new markets that they've forgotten the core of their business and it shows.",No need to google reddit threads anymore.https://thegigabrain.com/,Google's MO has always been to start up 100 new things at a time and then cancel 98 of them so I don't think shutting stuff down is a sign of problems.  Agree with the rest though,"Have you tried searching with those terms using Bing? All you get in the top results is: a list of every craft store in city, ""Yelp"", ""Yelp"", ""Yelp"", Joanne Fabrics, Michaels, and Yellow Pages. So this is not a google problem.","Google suppresses reddit results, I have to type in ""blah blah blah reddit"". I still believe in GOOG, even if you change the website they still have the browser. I think they'll keep popping up on cutting edge stuff","Earlier poster said TripAdvisor and Yelp are seen as trusted sources so they rank well. Yes, sort of. The bigger reason is that they spend millions of dollars to optimize the huge amount of localized content they have. They‚Äôre writing content to fit the search queries consumers are performing on Google. Users click, which gives Google a signal about the quality of content, giving them a boost in rankings. There‚Äôs a hell of a lot more that goes into it, but that‚Äôs the gyst on the organic search side. In the paid side, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre realizing just how entrenched they are to individual business performance. There is still absolutely no substitute to drive direct sales. I‚Äôve overseen search budgets up to $80million a year. I had an unlimited budget as long as I hit my ROI targets. Depending on the industry, each click can range from $0.25 for branded terms to $75+ PER CLICK. Big banks spend hundreds of millions a year in paid search. Theres literally no other marketing channel in which consumers are telling you exactly what they‚Äôre looking for, exactly when they‚Äôre ready to buy. Their account servicing teams are effective in keeping that spend up, too. I was once sent an email accidentally by a google analytics team which outlined for a acct rep just about how much they thought their advertising clients likely had available to increase their search budgets by. They came within $50k of forecasting how much I had in discretionary budget (for a budget in the millions). I used the dip to buy in at $95 after that horrible AI demo and don‚Äôt plan on selling on any foreseeable timeline.",&gt;¬†I've noticed that they also keep shutting down new products. The cloud based video game service? Gone. Hangouts? Gone. Reader? Gone.[I just want to mention that this is nothing new for Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/)¬†(Reader in particular was shut down over 10 years ago). In my opinion if Google‚Äôs habit of shutting down products was a bad sign for their stock I would have expected it to manifest long before now.¬†,"Part of the problem is that AI has made it way easier to hijack Search Engine Results (via SEO) on all search engines, not just Google. There's been news articles in the last week or so of experts talking about how this has been a growing problem of late and how Google is losing to the bots and will likely continue to lose to them overtime as AI gets even better.",But your action is to still buy Coke so....
investing,Jan,19fayu3,"GDP: US economy grows at 3.3% annual pace in fourth quarter, faster than expected","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gdp-us-economy-grows-at-33-annual-pace-in-fourth-quarter-faster-than-expected-133828802.htmlThe US economy grew at a faster rate than expected in the fourth quarter, capping off a year many expected to end in recession with one final economic surprise.The Bureau of Economic Analysis's advance estimate of fourth quarter US gross domestic product (GDP) showed the economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.3% during the period, faster than consensus forecasts. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimated the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2% during the period.The reading came in lower than third quarter GDP, which was revised down to 4.9%. For the year, the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% up from 1.9% in 2022.","Not only did we avoid a recession in 2023, we didn‚Äôt come close to one. Shocking, though welcome news¬†","Soft landing might be happening after all? Last year around this time when recession kept being forecasted, I thought the bizarre part of it was that unemployment was still extremely low, spending was up, supply chains had largely stabilized, and indicators like housing prices were still high (mostly from low inventory I know, but still they haven't dropped either).I work in tech, so a big change in this last year has been that job postings have largely dried up. I went from multiple recruiters trying to get my attention at the beginning of the year to maybe a lame ping from one at the end of the year. And there have been quite a few high profile layoffs along the way. But it does seem like if you really need a job, even in tech, you can still find one. There's just more work to do. Many of us are still making good salaries, I haven't seen a backslide on pay.Cautiously optimistic, seems like we're still getting through various ripples caused by going through a global pandemic.","Time and time again, nothing gets people upset like good economic news. It truly depends on whether your guy is in the White House¬†",&gt;How long can we keep the Ponzi going doing services for one another and calling it growth?Weird coming from a fan of crypto.,Yes. All gdp percentages are always inflation adjusted,It sure felt like a recession in some sectors. Around half a million tech workers were laid off and layoffs continue.,"I'm sure you can always find some sector that was in a recession by that definition no matter how good the economy was.It was just a few years ago for example that every sector was up a lot over the last 5 to 10 years during a strong bull market, all except for the energy sector that is, due to how much oil was struggling.","Yea also working in tech‚Ä¶ I find it funny that I was one of those saying a recession won‚Äôt happen, which largely turned out to be true‚Ä¶ except for the industry I work in, lol.Sucks because I was really hoping to quit my job and take a few months off, but now I‚Äôm a bit too worried that will result in an extended bout of unemployment.","So crypto's digital ledgers aren't a service designed to replace other payment processing services? You know, those ponzi schemes that contribute to GDP.","Eh, a handful of large investment banks and other financial firms predicted it for 2023. It‚Äôs not too surprising considering we had a (albeit mild) recession recently in Q421 - Q122."
