But on the other hand, the fact that there is way more money in the market, may simply create more opportunities, leverage and tools needed to create massive unpredictable swings even though companies are doing a good job, when before in the 1800s, there were lots of panics but not a lot of tools, alternates, borrowing, and not a lot of people investing in stocks.  Anyway hope that helps make you more indecisive...",We will always regress to the mean,Where's 1997?,2002 over there looking like it needs a new friend.

Stocks rose into October, when a 5-year bull market ended as the S&amp;P 500 stock index topped out at 1,562. In January 2008, the S&amp;P 500 entered a correction, down 10% from the peak. But when all of Bear Stearns failed two months later, stocks remained steady, buoyed by aggressive government action to contain the damage. By May, the S&amp;P regained a few points.  &gt; That summer, however, mounting financial losses finally started to spook investors. By July 2008, the S&amp;P was down 20% from the prior peak‚Äîa bear market. Stocks zig-zagged for the next two months, but panic selling began after Lehman‚Äôs bankruptcy, leaving the S&amp;P 500 down 40% from the peak nearly a year earlier.

I'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.  I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennial and Zoomers.  Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it‚Äôs something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought my shares at 18 yrs old with $2k I had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said he saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly‚Äôs retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy a stock if I can‚Äôt afford 1,000 shares‚Äù. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for.   He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled my ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I ""confirmed"" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and doesn‚Äôt even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.  He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he‚Äôs also a gold-digging SOB and he knows it!

This isn't just any tale. It's the saga of how a boomer with balls of steel and his millennial heir-apparent took on the Nvidia colossus and came out smelling like a rose bathed in YOLO sauce.  Chapter 1: The Awakening  It all started on a stormy afternoon. Grandpa, a veteran of the dot-com bubble and a survivor of the '08 financial meltdown, decided it was time to pass on his wisdom. Between sips of whiskey and yelling at the TV, he turned to Timmy and said, ""Listen here, you little rascal, the secret to unfathomable wealth isn‚Äôt in saving... it's in the art of the YOLO.""  Timmy, whose investment experience was limited to buying skins in video games, was intrigued. ""But Grandpa,"" he inquired, ""where do we start?""  With a gleam in his eye, Grandpa pulled up a chart of Nvidia. ""Graphics cards, my boy! The world's thirst for these silicon beauties is unquenchable. And with every gamer, crypto miner, and AI researcher clamoring for more, it's our ticket to the moon!""  Chapter 2: The Bet  Armed with nothing but a Wi-Fi connection and a Robinhood account funded by years of neglected birthday checks, they began their quest. Grandpa, with his ancient wisdom, saw beyond the mere mortals' fear of PE ratios and market corrections. ""To Valhalla!"" he exclaimed, as they went all in on Nvidia calls right before earnings.  The Wall Street elite laughed. ""Foolish boomers and their millennial minions,"" they sneered, ""they stand no chance.""  But Grandpa Diamond Hands wasn‚Äôt just any investor. He had seen companies rise and fall, fortunes made and lost, all while keeping his hands steadier than a surgeon on Adderall.  Chapter 3: The Rollercoaster  Earnings day came, and with it, volatility that would make even the most seasoned trader's heart skip a beat. Nvidia‚Äôs stock did the cha-cha, sliding down faster than DMs in an Instagram model's inbox, only to rocket up moments later.  Timmy's face was a palette of human emotion, painting a picture of hope, despair, and the kind of intense gastrointestinal discomfort one feels after consuming too much Taco Bell.  But Grandpa? Cool as a cucumber. ""In the stock market, you either ride the wave or get wiped out,"" he said, adjusting his aviator glasses as if he were about to drop the hottest mixtape of 1985.  Chapter 4: To the Moon  As the dust settled, the impossible happened. Nvidia announced groundbreaking developments, sending their stock soaring higher than Snoop Dogg at a 4/20 festival. Grandpa and Timmy's calls were now worth more than the GDP of a small island nation.  The Wall Street bets crowd went wild. Memes of Grandpa Diamond Hands were plastered all over the internet, hailed as the prophet of profit, the sultan of stocks, the absolute unit of unbridled financial recklessness.  Timmy, now a true believer in the church of YOLO, looked up to his grandfather, tears of joy and visions of Lamborghinis dancing in his eyes. ""What now, Grandpa?"" he asked.  Grandpa, looking off into the sunset, said, ""We do it all over again tomorrow, my boy. For the market giveth, and the market taketh away. But for those with diamond hands, the market mostly just giveth.""  And so, the legend of Grandpa Diamond Hands and his grandson Timmy was born, a tale whispered in the hallowed halls of r/wallstreetbets, inspiring generations of traders to turn their dreams into memes, and their memes into dreams.  Remember, kids, this tale is for entertainment purposes only. Don't try this at home unless you're prepared to live in a van down by the river, trading Wi-Fi for stock tips.  And always remember, in the grand casino of the stock market, the house always wins... unless you're Grandpa Diamond Hands. Then you just YOLO your way to Valhalla.

wallstreetbets,Feb,1b1f7py,Got laid off. Dumped my entire severance and 401K into my first option play. Thank you VKTX.,"Got dumped by my company at the end of 2022,  was given about $15K after tax severance and had around $20K to roll over into an IRA. I was sitting around jobless trying to figure out what shares to buy for my IRA. Had never touched options before.   There was a major event around this time, like it was fate, involving a Viking competitor. I had been in and out of Viking since 2016, as they're a fabulous small company. This event inspired me to dump all my 401K rollover cash into VKTX shares.   I was so supremely confident in Viking though, the thought started to fondle my mind that I should buy options. I finally mustered the courage in January 2023 to spend all my severance plus $10K of my own cash into about 230 contracts for May and June. (I was very early then).   Viking released some amazing obesity data in March and I was deep ITM. I decided to hold because I didn't actually buy them for obesity but for their previous major focus, NASH, which was releasing data in the Spring. The NASH pop wasn't as big as I would have liked with my huge stack but I still got out turning that severance into $176K, plus my IRA shares.  Viking and bio overall took a beating throughout Summer and early fall, as Viking went from a NASH focused company to obesity. I then began to plan for my winter 2023-24 moves, and loaded up on about 200 January calls fairly cheap, with Viking set to release data in November and December or early Jan.

So I got laid off and got inspired to go all into Viking and netted around $600K in a set of 9 months trades.

Congrats and fuck you,&gt;Not an entirely smooth ride but overall happy.  It's wild that you think you need to tell us you're happy with your 5500% return in a month.  Yeah I would have figured that out,Holy fook,that's the purest form of gambling,"""fuck you"" is literally the best praise you can get here","It was really difficult, especially on days down 30%.  But I reminded myself that I had set out the strategy in the very beginning: OTM NVDA calls, never risk more than 50%, buy calls on dips, play until earnings or $2M. I had done okay trading (breaking even or so) previously but realized I would always lose most gains when I emotionally deviated from the original plan, so that experience beat into my head the importance of not panicking or getting greedy.","Starting with $1.5k. ""Play to $2 million"". Reasonable.","Calls are a contract giving the _option_ to buy a stock at a predetermined price. A 400$ call says that the owner (buyer) has the opportunity to buy a stock at 400$ per share. If the share price is 380 by the expiry, the contract is worthless (why exercise 400 when you can buy from the market at 380). On the other hand, if the shares trade at 420 by the time it expires, you make a 20$/share profit.  The real gambling comes from the fact that a contract represent 100 shares. If you buy a 400$ call for a premium of 1$, it means that you pay 100$ now (premium is per share) for the opportunity to buy 100 shares at 400$ each later in time. If the share price by the time the call expires is 420$, you made a 19$ (20$ diff - 1$ premium) profit PER SHARE, so 1900$ profit or 19x what you invested.  Puts are the reverse, it lets you sell shares at a predetermined price. So you essentially want the stock price to lower so you can buy at market price and exercise the contract for profit.  Calls and puts are a thing in Europe too. The main difference is that, iirc, you can only exercise at expiry whereas American options can be exercised whenever.  My 0.02$ is that you shouldn't put any meaningful amount in them if you don't understand them well, you can see it as a more-likely-to-payout lotto ticker",I watch all of you generating enormous profits with options. Is this gambling or is there a scientific basis for it?

wallstreetbets,Feb,1aq4wmx,$10k into $990k in 45 days,"Greetings fellow autists of r/wallstreetbets, gather 'round and behold the saga of how I transformed my humble 10k into a mind-blowing 990k in the blink of an eye ‚Äì with a dash of luck and a whole lot of diamond hands!  https://preview.redd.it/qly1hdzo4fic1.png?width=1398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31a5cd78a346f3c0f568b2e76fc60baa493313ae  But first, let's peel back the curtain and expose the underbelly of my journey. Like many of you, I've tasted the bitter sting of defeat. Cue the dramatic music as I recount the tale of my $387k nosedive in First Republic Bank ‚Äì a wild ride through bank runs and reversals that left me questioning my sanity and my portfolio.  Fast forward to this year, armed with nothing but a measly 10k and a burning desire for redemption. I kicked things off with some risky moves on Coinbase, doubling my cash to 20k with some spicy weekly puts. Because why settle for crumbs when you can chase those sweet, sweet tendies?  Then, like a hawk eyeing its prey, I kept a close watch on DWAC. With Trump's name plastered all over it and whispers of a merger with Truth Social, I could smell tendies cooking from miles away. When news broke of Trump's triumph in the Iowa caucus, I knew it was time to roll the dice. I scooped up those juicy 35c options faster than you can say ""To the moon!""  At one point, my account ballooned to over $700k ‚Äì enough to make even the greediest Wall Street fat cat jealous. But did I cash out? Nah, I was too busy dreaming of yacht parties and tendie-filled hot tubs. It wasn't until I saw $ARM pumping like it was on steroids that I knew it was time to switch gears.  In a move that would make even the bravest of autists sweat, I yoloed my entire 440k into weekly 130 puts faster than you can say ""YOLO."" Sure, I took a hit with a 15% drop yesterday, but did I panic? Hell no. Today, I stand before you with a gain of 125%, turning that 440k into a cool 990k!  And for the skeptics out there, feast your eyes upon the snapshot of my trade activities from the past month ‚Äì undeniable proof that sometimes, just sometimes, even a degenerate gambler can strike gold.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/x7lc5cf35fic1.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd7775ff19cf82186f57946a1fa10a8552b3b7d3  Now, before you all rush to replicate my miraculous feat, heed my advice: disable margin and options trading ASAP. Trust me, I may have stumbled upon a pot of tendies, but luck can be a fickle mistress.  TLDR: from 10k to 990k ‚Äì a rollercoaster ride through the highs and lows. 10k to 20k in COIN puts, 20k to 440k in DWAC calls, 440k to 990k in ARM puts.","already disabled margin and options on my play account.

wallstreetbets,Feb,1aicsed,"We're not in a ""bubble"" that will pop. We just got priced out of the system. This is what getting left behind looks like.","The U.S. government has always issued treasury bonds to help raise money as needed, since the days when Thomas Jefferson was making love to his slave-wives. 10-year treasuries are not new.  What is very new, is that only since 2008 has the U.S. government (through the Fed) begun buying it's Own debt, because it can't afford to pay back anyone else, so it's only option is to be indebted to itself. You don't have to be an economic Ph.D. candidate to understand the fiction this creates:  With my right hand, I write 100 I.O.U.s for $1,000,000 each at 5% interest. But shit, that's $5,000,000 in interest due. I don't got that kind of money. So instead of giving those 100 I.O.U.s out to 100 Saudi princes, I give 50 to the Saudis, take their $50,000,000, then  I put the other 50 in my left hand and I press a button to print $50,000,000 for myself. Fucking tight, right? Now I only have to pay $2,500,000 in interest and I get $100,000,000.  Keep in mind, this charade only began in 2008. Before 2008, the U.S. government was not giving itself I.O.U.s. This had to happen for the U.S. to remain solvent, because the Saudis can demand their interest payments, but I don't have to do jack shit for myself besides jerk off and wipe the cum off my tummy with the 50 I.O.U.s in my left hand.  16 years of drunken debauchery, prostitutes, endless blow, and partying go by, and all the sudden I wake up and there's cum and piss and shit everywhere, and 16 out of the 20 rooms in my party mansion are so stuffed full of the I.O.U.s I wrote to myself, I couldn't even begin to calculate the amount of interest I have failed to pay myself. But I can't keep 100% of the I.O.U.s. If I did that, people would get real suspicious about my magic money machine and try to take it away from me.  So, to keep up the charade, I now have to start taking bags of the I.O.U.s out of my spare bedrooms, haul them to the street, and let the ""others"" of the world purchase them, so that in the future I have more spare room in my mansion to write myself more I.O.U.s when daddy needs a new yacht. But the problem is, if I give out my precious cum-stained I.O.U.s, I want to do that at the lowest interest rate possible. If people don't want them, I have to offer higher interest rates to unload my mansion. If people do want them, I can get a lower interest rate.  Here's where the stock market comes in.  If you have money, you know that you don't let that shit sit in your bank account becoming more worthless every day inflation chips away at your net-worth. Your money has to be doing Something to remain consistent with ever-rising costs. What are your options? Real-estate, stocks, or bonds. Those are the big three. Even if you want to start your own business, you still put your money into the company and issue yourself and your partners stock as ownership tags for dividend payouts.  High interest rates are not going anywhere, and inflation has been so hot for so long, real estate is not a very good long-term investment at this point because your every-day johnny tsunami can't even afford to rent from you. Bonds have been a bust for so long because Scrooge McNuggins would rather  clean up loads and fill his 15 bedrooms with self-noted I.O.U.s. Meanwhile, everyone knows that you're just asking for trouble buying Bank bonds and CDs because interest rates are so high that no one can take loans from the banks, so the banks can't make money, and if the banks can't make money how the fuck are they going to pay you your money? That just leaves the stock market.  That is how we wind up in a situation with historically inflated P.E. This is why we wind up in a situation where a company that makes $170 billion in profit is valued at $3 trillion. Because there is literally no better way to make money with your money.  This does not appear to be changing anytime soon. I'm not saying all this to say we're in a ""bubble"" that will burst. Because what the fuck else would we do with all this money?  What I'm trying to say is, you now have to spend $100 to make $1, where before you could make $1 spending $50. And this is just going to get worse.  What I'm trying to say is if you didn't turn your $50 into $100 in the last 5 years, then you got left behind and there is no catching up.",I need Margot Robbie in a hot tub to explain this to me,TLDR:  https://preview.redd.it/meo99alschgc1.jpeg?width=2473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc97d09634481cd75fd0c48d5241439d1c42a901,&amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ti9e4nqgbhgc1.jpeg?width=410&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76f373b38b87025610245c6cdcd75e4e68de04e6,OP has sledgehammer marks on his forehead.,https://preview.redd.it/snzanaj7wigc1.jpeg?width=418&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1db63b1390546c32b2187a3dcffb94ea8fd692a,I dno how awards work anymore but here‚Äôs this message,OP says stock market is overvalued and will remain so.

wallstreetbets,Feb,1awnra7,Made the mistake of telling my grandson about my portfolio ,"Just wanted to share an experience about why you do not disclose your wealth, stock portfolio to anyone‚Ä¶including family.  Years ago, I told my 18 year grandson about a stock (NVDA) that could be a good long term purchase as he had just gotten into finance and was watching Graham Stephan to learn more about being financially literate and things he could do to help his future retirement.  Long story short, he disregards my advice and does fuck knows what with his graduation money.    Fast forward to Covid, he‚Äôs collecting unemployment and using stim checks on call options and is making money calling me and telling me tickers that he thinks would be a extremely profitable.  Some examples are he projected NKLA to be $150+, Game Stop was a good buy at $300+, and the list goes on.  To his surprise, in 2022 he got wiped out and his parents reluctantly let him move back in to help him get back on his feet.  During this time period, he would constantly call me and tell me about things that could pop off and if only he had some money he could invest to make some of the money back.  This led to him showing up uninvited to my home and trying to kiss my ass to solicit a loan or potentially trying to ‚Äúsecure‚Äù his spot in my will.    With all these unsolicited visits, I had to pretend that I was ill and no longer able to use my smartphone as he would constantly ask me to Zelle or Venmo him money and that if he were to come he would have to clean up after me.  As a result the visits stopped but at this point I believe he is just hoping I croak soon.

wallstreetbets,Mar,1b8a3n8,The downfall of Amazon $AMZN has started.,"Investors and consumers need to know this very important fact about Amazon. They just dug their own grave. Third party sellers make up about 65% of the sales generated on Amazon and recently they did a dirty move to third sellers that will have many leaving the platform or raising prices so high that Amazon becomes uncompetitive to consumers. Amazon just announced/implemented two new double-dip fees that will crush third party sellers and that's not even an exaggeration.   The first fee which has been implemented already is an ""inbound placement fee"" which is a shipping fee Amazon tacks on to send inventory to Amazon ""Prime"" for Amazon FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). This fee has increased the shipping cost for third party sellers by 6-10x. For example, a seller sending a truckload of inventory (prior to this inbound placement fee) to Amazon traditionally spent about $600-$800, sometimes way more. Now on top of this they are charged with the inbound placement fee of about $3,000-$5,000. This essentially wipes out a huge chunk, if not most, of the profit margin for a seller on Amazon. Add in the additional fees Amazon charges: 15% referral fee (just to list on their site), 8-15% fulfillment fee (FBA; picking, packing and delivery), storage fees (around $0.78 per cubic foot) and advertising costs (about 2-15% of the price of each good depending on the market).   The second fee which will take place in about a month is a ""low inventory fee"" which is a fee imposed by the Amazon algorithm when inventory is starting to run low at Amazon fulfillment centers. This fee can be anywhere from $0.32-$1.11 PER ITEM. The kicker is that the Amazon fulfillment center receiving process is a huge cluster fuck that can take 30+ days to inbound and check-in from when the Seller ships it. That is, if Amazon doesn't lose or damage the goods at the warehouse OR during delivery.     So by the time Amazon ships a product out to a customer, they have essentially pocketed about 60% of the sale. When you take out the cost of the good for the seller, that leaves them with very little profit margin, if any. The margins were already razor thin before these rate hikes and now they are all but gone.  Why is this important to investors and customers? The only solution for third party sellers to barely keep their head above the water and maintain a remote semblance of their razor thin margins prior to the new fees is to raise prices. I'm talking 20-30% price increases are required at a minimum just to get back to par. You want to talk about all the issues with inflation well, now you know, corporate greed is being shown at its finest. Amazon reported a $30.4 billion net income for 2023 but will penny pinch third party sellers even more at the expense of driving prices up for consumers like never before seen on the platform. This will cause consumers to look elsewhere to shop other than Amazon because Amazon will now be highly uncompetitive. It's just a matter of time. Amazon shot themselves in the foot and needs to reverse course on these absurd fees.   PUTS ON $AMZN",Probably smart of Amazon. Have you been on there lately? It's a no-brand Chinese junk farm. I think they realize they are starting to have a perception problem.,Are you telling me my KYFLOGGE Ergonomic Chair Gaming Chair with Reclining Posture and Lumbar Support Ergonomic Office Chair is Chinese junk?,"No, it's the FREGGOME chair with the ""best lumbar comfort Spine doctor approval"" that is Chinese junk.

Captive audiences get screwed on their margins, this is monopoly capitalism 101.","It‚Äôs going to sky rocket with these new revenues. If anything double down now. It‚Äôs been all AWS, if the retail business starts making real money finally things are going to take off",With 5578 fake 5 star reviews,Yep can always find the exact same items being sold from Chinese websites for 25% of the cost.,The reason I won‚Äôt listen to you OP is because you‚Äôre considering one possibility and staunchly defending it rather than considering all possible outcomes and weighing them. You might turn out to be correct but even if you are this is shit analysis.,AWS is worth the stock price on its own. These little trucks driving around and dropping off boxes is just marketing.,Counterpoint.  This is a zero issue. A good majority of the people who buy from Amazon could not tell you if they've purchased from a 3rd party seller.  Prices will increase as smaller 3rd party sellers buckle to the financial whims of Amazon but their main customer isn't really going to defect.

wallstreetbets,Mar,1biqt1k,DD: I DD'd the nvidia run up last year ($250-&gt;$700) and was right. Now I have a new prediction,"Here's my nvidia DD from last year (NVDA was $250 and I predicted $700 within a year): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\_nvda\_to\_700\_by\_this\_time\_next\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)  Last week I timed the exit on my BTC and QQQ holdings fairly well. **Now I'm setting my sights on a new horizon: AMD**  AMD is sort of like the nice ugly step sister of hot bae nvidia. Everyone ""likes"" her, but she doesn't get invited to parties and no one takes her seriously. Right now reminds me of Ryzen 1. When AMD was $12, I predicted AMD's stock price would triple in the next two years due to how well the architecture fit with datacenter needs. I posted my DD here and was right. It took most people by surprise because at the time Intel had 99% of the datacenter CPU market. Now we look at $180+ AMD price. I think we are once again going to be surprised by sue bae and co.  I'll get to my evidence that AMD will exceed expectations yet again, but first I want to address some obvious points of skepticism.     1. **Firstly AMD's seemingly absurd P/E ratio of 364%:** I'm going to show that not only is AMD's revenue going to go up by an absurd amount in the next year, but also its net income margin. Nvidia operates at around 50% income right now and AMD is operating at around 20% right now. That gap is going to close considerably in the next year. I'm estimating AMD will reach around 35-40% net income. On top of that AMD will grow revenue by 50% in the next year (wishful thinking would say as high as 70% more revenue) exclusively due to AI accelerators. This will all lead to considerably more realistic P/E ratio. 2. **Next Nvidia's control on the market:** The evidence points to this being a detriment to Nvidia. AI companies are looking to diversify from Nvidia because they don't want to be vendor-locked, Nvidia has a 1 year back order on its top AI accelerators, and Nvidia's massive profit margin makes it easy to undercut their price. Furthermore, CUDA dominance is highly exaggerated today. I use this stuff every day, and ROCm is absolutely production ready, especially for large companies who have the staff to optimize for it. The people who say ROCm sucks haven't used it in a while -- AMD is working on it at a break neck pace.  # Now on to my DD  The debate about AMD's price largely boils down to its newest AI accelerator's value (the MI300X) versus Nvidia's current AI accelerator (the H100). AI accelerators are now most of the accelerator market (including GPUs), and also have the highest profit margins by far, so they are basically 80% of the valuation on these companies' stock prices. Yes the H200 and the new GB200 are coming out soon for Nvidia, but the MI300X has a timing lead on them which enables it to get some foothold. So for the moment, its MI300X vs H100 for companies deciding what to buy.     **Accelerator Value:** Reviews for the MI300X are going to come out imminently (within a few weeks), and we will begin seeing hard evidence for its value proposition then. I have spent a lot of time on older AMD cards analyzing their performance versus big green. My findings are that generally AMD is capable of being as fast or faster than Nvidia, but most open source projects are optimized better for Nvidia so in the real world AMD has a performance disadvantage. However in the case of the MI300X, its raw performance is so large over an H100, it will likely produce slightly better real world performance. Also the MI300X is selling for around $25k per card (you can buy it right now [https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2](https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2)) where the H100 is around $40k, so companies will be looking at benchmarks in a couple weeks that point to the MI300X being slightly faster and considerably less expensive.     **Nvidia supply constraint:** Nvidia has a back order of around a year for their latest AI accelerators. This means if a company needs to immediately purchase accelerators for a new project, they simply can't from Nvidia at scale. AMD's order books are currently open, but probably filling fast for this reason.     **Announced customers:** Meta is going to be the largest customer for the MI300X. They have indirectly announced that they will purchase up to almost half of their 600k accelerators this year from AMD ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta\_ai\_chips/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta_ai_chips/)). This customer alone will add 25% to AMD's revenue and improve their profit margin from 20% to roughly 28%. MS has already started deploying the MI300X on Azure and Oracle has announced they will launch VMs with them, but neither has announced numbers. Who won't be using AMD? OpenAI has a multi-year contract with nvidia, and Google uses their own proprietary TPU.     **AI accelerator headwind:** The AI accelerator market is expected to have a CAGR of over 20% for the next 5+ years. This means there will be continued supply constraints that incentivize diversifying hardware. New players inherently have an advantage because of this. It just happens that AMD is the next new player to be mature and scaled enough for widespread adoption. Yes Intel and startups will probably do fine also, but AMD is seeing ridiculous growth at this very moment that hasn't appeared on their earnings report yet (fulfillment for the MI300X did not ramp up until roughly January). There is such a ridiculous amount of demand in this ai accelerator market that everyone in it will grow.  # My price target: $450 AMD  After doing some napkin math on the market, I think it is reasonable for AMD to acquire 15-20% of the AI accelerator market by the end of the year, up from an inconsequential market share before. This includes speculation about AMD's product competitiveness, their ability to scale, the customers that will be interested in buying AMD, market growth, and new Nvidia product launches. Extrapolating that marketshare into net income by using a rough margin per card and using Nvidia's P/E ratio as a baseline model, translates to an AMD fair stock price of around $450 by the end of the year.  AMD's price will start to go up after the MI300X reviews come out and rumors of their customer acquisitions come in. The May earnings report will be where it starts to appear on their books, but they are still ramping up right now and Q2 is where we will see the largest earnings growth.  **My positions are: $190 6/21C and $200 10/18C**  That's all. See you later this year.","I don‚Äôt say this lightly, but if this hits, I‚Äôll suck your dick.","Step 1: Make two DD posts in opposite directions about a volatile stock  Step 2: Delete the wrong one a few months later  Step 3: Repeat about 50 times  Congratulations, you are now a finance influencer","I mean OK, you predicted NVIDIA but you also posted how the FED would definitely decrease rates 2 months go to ‚Äòprevent China contagion‚Äô.

Way to go Dara!  https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c  Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.  https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51  Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.  From the 10-Q:  ***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***  Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?  Later from the 10-Q:  ***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***  So they have three major holdings:  * Aurora Innovations * Didi * Grab  They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.  So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:  https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8  So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.  Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):  https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237  https://preview.redd.it/9l4whws58psc1.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b607d395efc1477eb3441812649d57757cecbff3  https://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb  This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!  Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.  Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.  Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:  * Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain) * Didi ($414 million gain) * Grab ($91 million loss)  It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.  But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?  Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:  https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a  First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.  https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874  Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.  Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.  https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4  Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!  So let's tally up the damage here:  * Grab: $123 million loss * Didi: $69 million loss * Aurora: $505 million loss  So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.  Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.  TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.  As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?",https://preview.redd.it/fi8umnfmfpsc1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f19b6927dfba693d8a725aef702a38b9554d7b9,Ignore Visualmods apprentice.

The market rate for these chips is a few dollars each compared to the $900 you're paying for your i9 unlocked.  The way you make money and a foundry business is by using old fully depreciated tools so you don't have to expense your depreciation when calculating profit. The raw inputs are basically free, it's sand and water, so you have (made up numbers) $7 of silicone, $3 of electricity, and $40 of depreciation on a chip you can sell for $20 for an operating loss of $30 even though you're making $10 on your raw inputs. TSMC uses old tools so that $40 of depreciation is $0.  What I imagine is happening is that Intel is so far behind in the foundry business that they don't want to wait 5 years for old tools, and they have decommissioned all of their unused tools, so they are using new tools and just eating the depreciation expense. The reason 2027 will be profitable is because the tools have a 5-year depreciation schedule and they were purchased in 2022.  The real test for Intel foundry will be if they can keep their revenue up. If they can't convince enough customers to leave TSMC, the foundry will fail."
wallstreetbets,Apr,1cavxt9,Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus.,"Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus.  Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday. April 22,2024  https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna148847  Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday ‚Äî an ‚Äúearnout‚Äù bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday‚Äôs price.  That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.  Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.  The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company‚Äôs majority shareholder. Total of 114.75 million shares.  When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump‚Äôs total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.  The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.  That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.  Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp.

wallstreetbets,Apr,1buya7v,Cannabis - not too late to get high bros,"Ok here‚Äôs the deal.  We all remember the hype when Canada legalized.  Everyone thought it was the ultimate infinite money glitch.  And for a while, based on the hype, it was.  Canada was the first major first world country to outright legalize (sorry Netherlands your half measures are no good for stonks), and the outlook was looking good for US legalization.  We had a boomer Republican president in the US at the time, but one who was decidedly less hostile to Marijuana than the typical boomer Republican.  Speaking of boomers‚Ä¶their parents who grew up watching reefer madness and blamed all crime on Mexican reefer addicts and always voted 98% no to any loosening of marijuana laws were finally starting to fucking die.  No one under 40 still thought it should be illegal and the national pulse had finally turned in favor of legalizing nationwide in the US.  Everyone saw it coming imminently.  But Canada is a nation of 38 million.  Barely a single major city in the US.  Not nearly enough to justify the size and scope of the weed market that emerged.  The stonks soared.  I remember ACB at 200 times it‚Äôs current price.  But it slowly dawned that no, in fact, America wasn‚Äôt going to reschedule, let alone legalize.  There wasn‚Äôt going to be a big enough market to support all the infrastructure the Canadian firms invested in.  The stocks cratered and a lot of degenerates lost a lot of money.  Then Biden, a democrat, gets elected‚Ä¶.the democrats being the party who overwhelmingly support legalization, it stood to reason that a liberalization of American marijuana law was imminent and again the stocks popped, though nowhere near the 2019 highs.  This is where I jumped in (MJ ETF, ACB and OGI)‚Ä¶and again, it slowly dawned that US legalization was going nowhere‚Ä¶and again the stocks slowly waned, punctuated occasionally by big pops on irrelevant news like another state legalizing‚Ä¶each time I thought this was it, this time it turns around for good.  I lost like 75% before giving up and selling my shares, and good thing I did, because I‚Äôd have lost another 75% had I sat on it.  Now Germany just legalized and again the stocks are popping and a lot of us can‚Äôt see past these old painful memories.  I get it.  Just hear me out.  Now keep in mind right off the bat Germany is a much bigger nation and economy than Canada (&gt;2X the population and 1.25x the GDP, roughly).  It alone can support a much larger market than Canada.  So the pop in weed stocks we‚Äôve seen now is already justified and yet they still have tremendous upside.  But my fellow regards, this is just the warmup round.  Joe Brandon is in trouble.  He‚Äôs behind in the polls, he‚Äôs seen as old, stuffy and senile.  His oldness, stuffiness and senility are perfectly encapsulated by his antiquated commitment to continuing marijuana prohibition.  It‚Äôs worth noting that he is the leader of a party that abandoned its commitment to marijuana prohibition decades ago and while he‚Äôs stubbornly been clinging to it more and more of the old fuddie duddie hardliners have died and almost no one in the country still supports continuing prohibition.  Certainly almost no democrats.  Also, RFK is running as an independent and he has confirmed he will make marijuana legalization a priority.  While RFK will be pulling support from trump too (think Covid hoaxery) I am convinced he‚Äôll be pulling harder from Brandon.  Brandon needs something big to revitalize his campaign, and he‚Äôs been dropping hints that marijuana very well could be that thing.  April is ‚Äúsecond chance month‚Äù and this year he went further than before in his commentary on the topic, suggesting rescheduling and/or hinting at legalization.  Kamala Harris has been pressuring the DEA to take action now.  Things are happening that are unlike anything from 2019 or 2021.  Traditionally 4/20 is associated with marijuana and the bettor in me senses something big may be coming this month, possibly on or around that day.  Yes, marijuana stocks are up somewhat on German legalization, but still down well over 90 to 95% or more from the 2019 highs.  I‚Äôm not saying YOLO on weed calls.  But picking up some shares right now is a relatively low risk (the stocks are already so so so far downbeaten with residual pessimism) move with tremendous potential upside.  TLDR; buy weed stonks before 4/20  Position: 5,000 Tilray in at 2.41.  No options (NB4 ‚Äòif you really believes in your DD you‚Äôd YOLO your life savings into calls‚Äô, I‚Äôm 40 years old and have 4 kids, I can‚Äôt afford the risk.  I don‚Äôt fuck with options, ever).  I‚Äôve read some DDs on here that convince me Tilray is the strongest play.  Pick whatever suits you.  This is not financial advice.  I‚Äôm a regard",I am too stoned to read all of this.,Biden needs to get this through DEA. deschedule not reschedule,"Honestly I agree with the low risk, how much further can they beat the living shit out of these weed stocks",they legalize cocaine and we stop using weed,Bye pawt stonk,Executive order that shit Joe,Also my fine friends of Reddit there's over 100 million share shorted and they have to start getting out real soon,Tilray. 119M shares short.

Curious. ü§î,"I thought one of the reasons given by the judge was that the board was not really independent of Musk, and so had a conflict of interest in approving the payout.  If they do the same thing now with the same board, is it not likely to be voided again in the same way? Is the plan to move to Texas and then hope judges there would not void it again?","The key part of the ruling is that while there was a shareholder vote, the guidance on the vote didn‚Äôt disclose the ties to Musk of the board that ‚Äúnegotiated‚Äù the payment. If they hold a new vote and openly say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre friends of Musk and basically just give him what he wants, please approve it anyway‚Äù, the shareholder vote should cover the board.  Originally I‚Äôd say that given that Tesla shares are largely owned by people who believe in Musk to some degree there‚Äôs a good chance of the vote passing regardless, but the recent demand for 25% of stock after selling a good chunk should be very alarming. This isn‚Äôt just about a one-time bonus; committing to Musk apparently means bankrolling whatever expensive distractions he finds too.","Well he does all the work, the rest of the employees are just there holding down the floor.  /s, just in case.","Lol, just when the stock is tanking.

wallstreetbets,Apr,1bw69sq,"In one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year, the S&amp;P500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a few hours. Here's why.","[Original](https://pro.thestreet.com/market-commentary/dramatic-shift-in-market-takes-everyone-by-surprise)  Thursday was supposed to be a quiet session as market participants awaited the very important March jobs report, which will be released Friday morning. Instead, it turned into one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year.  The day started with a gap-up open mainly due to chatter that there is weakness in the job market and that there is a good likelihood that the March jobs news may be softer than expected and trigger a Fed rate cut in June. It was a questionable premise, but it created a little squeeze action and some underlying support.  Later in the day, headlines hit that Fed member Kashkari commented that ‚Äúif inflation continues to move sideways, it makes me wonder if we should cut rates at all this year.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the first hawkish comment from a Fed member, and it probably wouldn‚Äôt have had too much of an impact, but then some other more dramatic news hit.  In Tel Aviv, Israel, residents were confused when their GPS applications showed that they were located in Lebanon. The reason was that the Israeli military was scrambling GPS signals in preparation for a possible drone attack by Iran. Reports circulated that Israel sees indications that Iran may launch missile/drone attacks from Iranian territory, possibly on Friday. Israeli officials informed the U.S. that an Iranian attack would trigger a response.  This news caused oil to spike higher, defense contractors to rally, and the market to sell steadily into the close.  The S&amp;P 500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a matter of a few hours. This has only happened four other times before, according to Jason Goepfert.  It was a dramatic shift and caught almost everyone by surprise. Sharp intraday reversals are often major turning points.  We still have the jobs news to deal with Friday morning, and we will see if there actually is an attack on Israel, but the market is now very unsettled. Volatility has spiked, and there should be a major shift in sentiment as a result of this action.  I‚Äôll have more in the morning prior to the jobs news, but that report now has the capacity to accelerate a correction that has been anticipated for several months.  Have a good evening. I‚Äôll see you Friday.  Edit: Kashkari started speaking at 2pm, when the markets were already crashing.

We were not merely ‚Äúlucky‚Äù in any sense. It is not true that anyone who invests in the market gets ‚Äúlucky‚Äù. The long term trend of up is completely explainable and has a very simple cause.  The cause is that most people don‚Äôt sell. It‚Äôs just not an activity that most market participants do. More importantly, there are many people who invest into the market in stages or in a variety of different stocks. Some of them systematize this by buying a portion of their salary. There‚Äôs even a strategy called DCA (Daily Cost Averaging) where people buy a certain amount of their favorite stock or crypto every single day. This is very common in Bitcoin. There is rarely ever an equivalent of a DSA (Daily Sell Averaging) because most people simply do not sell things day to day.   So on any given day, unless there is some sort of impending news or a sudden reason that can cause panic, most sell volume is simply bots. People are not regularly selling stocks every day. It is simply **not** a thing. Now, of course, most buy volume is also bots but it is unquestionably true that there are many, if not **exponentially**, more ‚Äúreal‚Äù buyers than sellers on any given day.   Pointing out how a few crappy companies have always went down long term doesn‚Äôt invalidate any of this. The main reason that happens is not because people are selling that stock every day.

wallstreetbets,Apr,1c4uddl,Donald Trump is taking his $ of DJT - today's resale registration is our ~30 day warning,"\*\*Background\*\*  I was looking into resale registrations, one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15%, here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)  Why would one file a resale registration? Well, on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says ""it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.""  TS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)  So, obviously it's not that.  \*\*Theory\*\*  Why else, then, would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\_2006/pinedo\_tanenbaum\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)  But why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?  Answer: He's not, he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.  FIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price.   ""But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!"" &gt; at the discretion of the issuer  ""But never agree to low price / it's fraud!"" &gt; price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price, like ""50% of the current value of shares.""  ""But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!"" &gt; Only before the the resale registration becomes effective, Afterwards, sell away.  ""But you'd have to say something to someone!"" &gt; They just did, and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).  SECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC, using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.  THIRD - slide all those PIPE purchased, cheap ass shares into the market all stealthy like. His other 150 million shares go to zero but (1) they only existed so he could use his control of the company to abuse PIPEs (2) zero was going to happen anyways.  \*\*Trading hypothesis\*\*  DJT falls faster than any institutional investor expects because Trump uses norms built into standard practices to supercharge his scams. Evidence: his entire presidency &amp; post-presidency and all the pathetic ""but norms"" hand waving by the political class. No exceptions made for institutional investor class, sorry.  DJT cultists catch the falling knife as usual.  \*\*Positions\*\*  $3k in Puts at price points between $25 and $5 over the next 8 months.  &amp;#x200B;","Tl;dr we knew before where this is going. Timeframe is the only question here, and at this speed it won‚Äôt take very long",I'll only add the obvious; Trump is in a dire financial situation with his lawsuits and nearly had trouble posting bail...If I were him I would get as much out as I could also despite fawking over everyone that finds me divine!

Therefore that's not an actual bond agreement in the first place, and hence the hearing on this upcoming Monday.","DJT, a rocketship towards the ground.",&gt;DJT cultists catch the falling knife as usual.   They are the distraction. The real play is entities that want to launder money and give it to a presidential candidate.

Most of their vaccine were sold to poorer countries that couldn't afford the mrna. With covid not being that threating anymore and with the updated vaccines that are mainly given to targeted populations, AZ's vaccine has no purpose whatsoever.

wallstreetbets,May,1cp63av,Biden to raise tariffs on Chinese EVs from 25% to 100% next week,"[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-plans-raise-tariffs-electric-vehicles-china-rcna151748](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-plans-raise-tariffs-electric-vehicles-china-rcna151748)  Administration officials are planning to make the announcement Tuesday (5/14/2024), though the timing could change.",What about American EVs with 100% Chinese components?,This is to encourage American infrastructure investment and obviously jobs while providing some time cover for the WAY behind legacy US automakers.,"This is to protect Detroit jobs.   China has electronics and battery manufacturing scale that nobody can beat. At that scale, they can drive down prices to the point no one can challenge them.   Last year, something like 90% of all batteries made in the world were made in China.",Can we even buy chinese EV in US?,"I don't understand why everyone is looking at the headline ""U.S. to Announce New Tariffs on Chinese Electric Vehicles"" and the takeaway is that you should be buying TSLA? No. Who has actually seen a Chinese EV in the United States? Exactly. They do not exist. So the headline of 100% tariffs on EVs from China is absolutely meaningless. The real substance to these tariffs are the things the United States actually imports.  So if domestic EV makers really aren't being hurt by Chinese imports then who are?  So let's look and see who actually stands to benefit from this? Looking back, Biden in 2022 introduced the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and one key part of that was tax credits for domestically manufactured solar panels. These credits which are called 45X tax credits \[1\] provide credits for clean energy components domestically produced. So this on paper seems like a boom for domestic solar manufactures.  Now, let's talk tariffs. As we all know Trump loved his Chinese tariffs which included solar panels in 2018, and Biden after taking office decided to extend them in 2022. However, as part of that extension Biden also provided an exemption for Bifacial Solar Panels, which at that time only accounted for a small percentage of the imported solar panels to the United States. Fast forward two years and bifacial solar panels account for 97% of imported solar panels. So today we have 14.25% tariffs on solar panels and 0% on bifacial solar panels due to the exemption. Well again 97% of the imports are bifacial (see Reuters link dated Apr 25 below). So if solar companies can get additional tariffs and new tariffs for bifacial panels they stand to print money hand over fist, they become a monopoly effectively. In 2024 First Solar will receive over a billion dollars in cash from the US government for simply running their business \[4\].  So what was the catalyst for this change? Well the First Solar (FSLR) CEO Mark Widmar. Mark has been lobbying congress and the Biden administration for nearly two years for these tariffs. And I can assure you Tuesday is going to be a celebratory day for Mr. Widmar. As recently as Mar 12th 2024, Mark Widmar CEO of First Solar gave testimony before congress \[2\]. As a result of this there was a bipartisan push for additional solar tarrifs, on January 30th senators Ossof, Brown, Rubio, and Warnock urged the Biden administration to increase solar tarrifs \[3\]. Again this was drafted by both democrat and republican senators, so the likelihood of losing these tariffs if Trump came back is slim to none, especially when Trump has talked of even more aggressive tariffs.  Not to beat a dead horse but a simple google search will reveal how long First Solar (FSLR) has been pushing for this. So I think it's pretty obvious that they are the ones who stand to benefit from this and not EV makers. So for every idiot you see mention TSLA or RIVN, ask them: How many Chinese EVs have you actually seen? And then maybe you will all see how congress makes money trading, they distract you with bullshit headlines meanwhile they trade the footnotes and make a killing.  Read these references and if you disagree...well then you my friend are a true regard.

Puts!,"Guys he answers this question literally every single year in the annual meeting.   He has said, for years, there are hundreds and hundreds of excellent businesses that are undervalued and absolutely worth investing in. The reason Berkshire Hathaway doesn't buy them all is because they would represent a miniscule fraction of the company's holdings. He does not want to end up with a portfolio of 2,000 companies worth under $100m each. It's a major effort to keep track of an existing portfolio and do due diligence for each new acquisition.   The sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway means that he's looking for investment opportunities worth billions or tens of billions. The issue with that is that there just aren't as many of those companies to begin with, and far fewer that are undervalued. He would rather keep the money in cash than put it into companies that don't represent a discount on his fundamentals analysis.

I just made a killing with Apple and Amazon monthlies, took my $10k withdrawal for May, and now I‚Äôm sitting cash waiting for a bloody day to re-enter.  I am a Permabull. The only time I went short is that the beginning of the pandemic. Stonks usually go up.  I‚Äôm usually too optimistic and get into early but if your calls still have a couple months until expiration, there is time to recover.   I keep my account close to balanced, 50% shares and 50% calls. That way if there‚Äôs a disaster, you‚Äôll still have your shares. I use the margin off the shares to play options.  Now that I‚Äôve taken out $150,000 and spent it on building a bad ass guest house on my ranch there‚Äôs no way I could ever end up in the hole. The trick is finding a way to protect yourself from your own greed. It‚Äôs easy to make your account go up but most of us stay in too long and get wiped out.  If you move money into a hard asset you can‚Äôt go tits up. I learned the hard way.  Got wiped out a few times and recovered.

It's basically something people can say even if they can't point to any concrete thing.    *""This roll out of streaming content will occur in three phases:""*  No ETA, no timeline, except that all three phases are described in the future tense.  And the first phase is just to ""introduce"" the CDN, which can likewise mean anything.  The CDN is not the consumer product, it's just the content delivery network that can then be used by a consumer product.  Only phase 2 entails releasing any sort of app to consumers.  *""In recent weeks, as part of its TV streaming initiative, TMTG signed contracts with its first data center partner to host its own TV content distribution network. The Company also signed contracts with a core hardware vendor to obtain equipment for the project.""*      They signed contracts for ... hosting and server equipment, perhaps?  I guess they're describing this as evidence of progress toward their future project, but hosting and server equipment is stuff that a social networking site would be paying for anyway.  Finally, they explain away their low revenue by saying that they're focused instead on long-term stuff.

wallstreetbets,Jun,1dowoqn,Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.  Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.  People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD &amp; NVIDIA offerings.  **But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**  Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**     Microsoft &amp; Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA &amp; Apple jumping in.  If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.  Investing in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom.",You know what. You should yolo into this.,"If you like it at 30, you‚Äôll LOVE it at 20","Yep, put your money where your mouth is OP and let‚Äôs see the positions",Nvidia went up almost 2 intels yesterday,Every regard in the comments wants the returns of nvidia/amd/etc. but none of them are willing to buy in before the mooning. Peak cinema in here.,I joined the INTC bagholder club last week. Shares and august calls. Ill just hold onto this in case i need it later![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267),"I can comment on this one actually. I know semiconductors and the industry better than most but I‚Äôm no expert so YMMV etc. disclaimers.   Intel is a very long way from using their ASML Deep EUV machine. Yes they got the first one. But now they have to develop the technology to use it. It‚Äôs new territory with all these new lithography machines. They don‚Äôt come ready to use out of the box. They are probably 2-5 years from having a process ready that uses it.   Further- you can‚Äôt just take your design and stick it in a new process node. You actually have to design the chip specifically for that node. Especially when you move manufacturers. The silicon made by intel and TSMC is actually quite different. So when they moved their manufacturing to TSMC they didn‚Äôt just take their design and hand it over. No, it was a massive investment to redesign the chips for the TSMC process. Things stay generally in the same place and the same superficial arrangement is there but at the gate level things look different.   Intel has really faltered on execution lately. With their 10 nm process they really fell apart. In some ways they bit off more than they can chew. They tried to add 3 new really advanced techniques into the process that would have rocketed them ahead of TSMC had they worked. But they couldn‚Äôt get them to work for a few years. TSMC is much better at executing and delivering new processes. They go for small incremental improvements each year.   Intel isn‚Äôt even manufacturing their newest generation themselves. That‚Äôs critical here. Most the semiconductor companies you talk about are either design houses or foundries or equipment makers. Intel did all three for years. So buying intel you are buying into all three industries. They fell apart on equipment and are buying outside equipment with ASMLs new machine. And they fell down on manufacturing with TSMC actually manufacturing the processor tiles for their new SKUs.   AMD is a much smaller company and much more efficient. They design one chip well and then reuse it in all their parts with different packaging processes and their ‚Äúchiplet‚Äù designs. Intel makes dozens of different masks. And each one takes engineering time.  Also, AMD spun off their in house foundry as Global Foundries about 10 years ago. So they don‚Äôt have to worry about that. They design their silicon for TSMC‚Äôs process and rely on them to innovate and deliver.   All that said, I do think Intel is oversold. They still have massive market share in the consumer and server markets. They‚Äôre losing market share but we‚Äôre talking from 95% to 85%. They are pulling much lower margins though because the ferocious competition from AMD forces them to lower their prices. And honestly AMD has the better server and consumer CPU parts IMHO. Intel has much stronger relationships with the system integrators from years and years of partnership and shady business practices so that companies like Dell and Lenovo and server manufacturers like Super Micro all tend to use Intel processors. AMD has struggled in this regard.   The bigger story though is that AMD has a ton of room to grow by stealing market share. And Intel has little place to go but hold the line or lose more share. Those relationships are really strong though and it‚Äôs worth looking into the arrangements they have with the integrators.   Intel has new management with a technical background instead of a sales background and that might help get the company back into the lead technologically but like getting a new head coach on a football team, it takes years to rebuild your bench and get the ball rolling on new research. Also the gains are getting harder and harder. The gates are only a few dozen atoms now. They aren‚Äôt really at this point getting smaller - they‚Äôre getting more dense which creates an ‚Äúequivalent shrinkage‚Äù. So 5 nm wasn‚Äôt 5nm feature size anymore it was a density as if the feature size was 5nm. So the power requirements aren‚Äôt going down like they should. But with the density increasing and the number of gates increasing and the amount of leakage in tiny gates means that power consumption and heat production are limiting factors. AMDs new cores are actually the same core. The efficiency cores are just smaller than the power cores. So the ‚Äúefficiency cores‚Äù just have to run slower because they are so dense and the heat gets built up.   There‚Äôs a lot to like with Intel but there are also very significant hurdles and many years of hard work to demonstrate that they can deliver - especially when it‚Äôs increasingly hard to make process node advancements. Exponential even.  If they deliver on backside power delivery first they might have a chance. Opening up the foundry might help. Especially with the US govt throwing money around for domestic production. But they won‚Äôt be making bleeding edge chips. They‚Äôll be making lower margin more mundane chips with their (relatively) less advanced lithography. Though 14nm and 10 and 7 are pretty solid nodes.",Thats the issue he already a bagholder,Since 1999 at that!,Intels a pet rock. It‚Äôs a savings account at your bank..

I was broke and in Thailand, and because of the time difference and partying I had purchased $2500 on a Wednesday of what I thought was Tesla call options that expired Friday (2 days later). The next day my drunk ass was staggering around playing with this Russia girl I met and the next thing I know etrAde is blowing me up, calling back to back to back, and this had never happened so In my mind I thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fuc*ed‚Äù, something bad has happened and they want their money. I didn‚Äôt have access to my app because of the cost of data, so I didn‚Äôt know what the hell was going on. I answered and it was etrAde support asking me what the hell I wanted to do with my Tesla options.   Turns out it was Friday, and I had no idea. Telsa just announced in the middle of the day its Tractor Trailers and the stock rocketed like 7-10% (if I remember correctly).  No I said I was broke, and I was. I had like 23k to my name. And I had made almost all of that on a Lululemon puts a month or two before where I spent like $500 on a ton of otm contracts and that $500 turned into 23k in 20 seconds when their stock plummeted from 70 down to like 45 after bad earnings. (Just had a feeling üòâ)  So I took my ass and my new found wealth of $23k to Thailand for a month lolz   So I am in Thailand, and that‚Äôs why when I say I was broke I still threw $2500 like a dumb ass into an OTM telsa calls that expired that week. I thought I had 2 days instead of 1, and I was willing to lose half the money on a gamble. And I‚Äôll be damn if I didn‚Äôt get my days wrong, and etrAde said ‚Äúyou need to deposit a half million dollars in the next couple hours if you want to exercise your position‚Äù. Drunk and confused as hell, I was terrified. And I wasn‚Äôt understanding.   I was like ‚Äúhow did I lose all my money, the contract doesn‚Äôt blah blah blah‚Äù and that‚Äôs when they said sir, your position is currently up $60,000 on the day and it expires at market close today. So you either need wire and exercise very quickly, or sell your options and take your profits.  Umm, did you just say I am up $60,000 on the day?   Then: Yes, actually now your up almost $70k.   Me: Please sell all my options right meow!   They did, and I went and got to an Internet cafe, and that‚Äôs when I was able to go online and see what the hell happened.   The month I turned $500 into almost $100k.   Never had a run like that since! If you go back and look at the Lululemon where it tanked from $72 to $45 after bad earnings, you will be able to verify this as legit lol.

wallstreetbets,Jun,1d75fxv,I have been stalking local Bath and Body Work stores for 5 months and believe they are going to crush earnings.,"I believe BBWI is going to crush earnings based on 5 months of store stalking and no one is talking about it. Literally not one mention about earnings on wallstreetbets. TLDR at the end.  **Background:**  I have been on paternity leave for a little over 5 months now. I live 20 minutes away from 3 different malls and thought I walking around them for an hour or two every day would be a great way to kill some time while also letting my newborn see new things. Around the same time I watched a video on how a Chinese coffee shop got outed for fake financials by people literally watching the store and counting the number of people buying things. That gave me the idea to track how many people were in stores and how many shopping bags I saw around the mall from each store indicating a purchase. Obviously there is a major difference between dozens of people watching stores vs just little old me but the data I gathered has been spot on for earning beats on what I considered to be outliers. The stores that have surprised me with their high volume are Gap, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and of course Bath and Body Works.  **Method:**  All in all I have 124 days worth of data so far. I usually only visit one mall a day but sometimes two. Any day of the week and usually between 12pm and 5pm. I try and park at different entrances so I don‚Äôt get biased in my counting of bags because I park right next to one store or another. I go to three different malls each catering to a different economic class. Pretty much lower, middle, and high income. I do 2 passes, about and hour apart, of each store I am tracking. I count the number of customers in the store. While I walk around, I also count the number of bags I see from each store. This is a bit harder to trust though as people with multiple bags usually condense into one. So stores with small bags (looking at you Sephora) are underrepresented. I would occasionally go into BBWI and count the items in people carts too but only did this a handful of times.  **Data:**  The average number of people I have seen at BBWI is 9.82 on weekdays and 23.68 on weekends. This crushes the average from all the stores I tracked which was 2.98 on weekdays and 8.2 on weekends. The only store with a higher average was Sephora which was 10.36 and 25.25 respectfully. All three malls had similar numbers with the higher income mall being slightly higher but not enough to note. I think this was due to young girls traveling in packs of 3 or 4 which I didn‚Äôt see at the other two malls.  The average number of bags (aka purchases) for BBWI was 4.1 on weekdays and 11.67 on weekends. Which again crushes the average of just 1.45 and 3.11.  For some context here are pictures of the check out line Saturday 30 minutes apart. Wanted to hide people because I think it is rude for a random stranger to snap pictures of people and post them online. There are currently multiple tellers checking out customers with 5 more people in line.  https://preview.redd.it/j7utbegx6d4d1.png?width=1485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66905e26bba9ebd5134ef3e817efaaf26b45b8cc  30 minutes later and still 5 people in line  https://preview.redd.it/dbjon4ep6d4d1.png?width=1493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ce85d8724ee99cd47b3e79a3b0bbaa7112b79bc  **Other Things to Note**  **Male Skin Care** \- Something I didn‚Äôt track, but surprised me, was the number of males in the store alone or with another guy (this goes for Sephora as well). Doing a bit of research on the topic of men's skin care shows a 6.2% year over year growth and a 389% increase in TikTok videos on the subject in the last year. I think it is actually going to be higher based on what I am seeing at the stores and Gen Z starting to come into their own money. That generation has pushed the needle on male beauty standards much more towards the feminine astatic (think Timothee, Lil Nas X, Brady Potter, Jungkook) and with that comes skincare. This is a huge expanding market that is just getting tapped into and based on what I am seeing in person they are capturing the market well.  https://preview.redd.it/cnqrxy5s6d4d1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b67bd389c4be5640f80f193f0e128ce3ba71d4e1  **Dupe Culture** \- This has been on the rise over the last year but it is starting to snowball now. Gen Z and Millennials are finally starting to push back on the, ‚Äúbuy the brand not the product‚Äù mentality. This was evident with E.L.F.s recent earning report and will be echoed in BBWI. Their house products have been praised for matching much more expensive fragrances. Paulreactss is one of the most popular fragrance TikTokers with 1.5 million subscribers and he has videos identifying BBWI scents that dupe much more expensive variations. Seriously just google Bath and Body Works dupes and you will see tons of people gushing about what BBWI has to offer and people saying they bought tons of their new product line that came out in the end of Q1.  **Subreddit** \- The Bath and Body Works subreddit has 86k subscribers. Just yesterday there is a post from an associate saying they are flooded with orders from their summer sales and people are buying literally entire lots of items. [https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1d6t0dr/from\_an\_associate\_to\_customers\_we\_love\_you\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1d6t0dr/from_an_associate_to_customers_we_love_you_but/)  Notable quotes from the thread:   ""It‚Äôs just been the second day of SAS and already we‚Äôve gotten over 100+ BOPIS orders placed""   ""...and bringing in 2 or more baskets of items is just not only exhausting but also unfair to the other customers who would‚Äôve wanted to get certain products but now can‚Äôt because someone else decided to buy all 10 sprays that were JUST put out...""   ""Yep I felt so bad for my friends because everytime they went on break or even took a second to look away from the bopis, the number would go back to 99+""  **TLDR** \- I have been to a Bath and Body Works over 250 times in the last 5 months to count the number of customers in the store. It has crushed my expectations. This coupled with male skin care rising and dupe brands like E.L.F. crushing earnings leads me to believe BBWI is going to kill earnings.

wallstreetbets,Jun,1d7vn6u,"NYSE to ‚Äúbust‚Äù all the ‚Äúerroneous‚Äù trades of Berkshire Hathaway stock at or below $603,718.30 a share","""Investors who purchased shares in Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway yesterday at a huge discount will see their trades canceled following a technical issue on the stock exchange.  On June 3, a data glitch led the global conglomerate‚Äôs stock price to fall to $185 a share, having previously closed at over $620,000. The drop meant a more than 99% discount on the Warren Buffett-led company.  This means a trader who snapped up just $925 worth of the stock at the rock-bottom price would now see their investment worth over $3 million today.  While it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed how many people purchased the Class A stock during the technical error‚Äîwhich lasted for around an hour and a half‚Äîthe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has swiftly undone their trades.  In an update posted at 9 p.m. last night, NYSE said it would ‚Äúbust‚Äù all the ‚Äúerroneous‚Äù trades of Berkshire Hathaway stock at or below $603,718.30 a share.  The issue, the exchange added, is related to a problem at the Consolidated Tape Association (CTA), which provides real-time information about quotes and trades on the exchange. The CTA oversees part of the Securities Information Processor (SIP) which consolidates all protected bid/ask quotes and trades into a single data stream.  The CTA said it experienced problems with price banding which ‚Äúmay have been related to a new software release‚Äù on SIP. As a result the CTA has reverted to the previous version of the software. The CTA did not immediately respond to Fortune‚Äôs request for comment.  During the blip, the NYSE placed halts on certain trades, and will seek to determine which are erroneous and thus eligible to be canceled.

Weird timelineüôÑ,doesn't want to know why Americans doesn't have free healthcare,"Remember how the Warriors had the first-ever **unanimous MVP** coming off another MVP the previous year, had the best season record ever, had back-to-back Finals appearances, and immediately after added ANOTHER MVP to the team?   ---   The Bay Area was already home to some of the largest companies of all time with some of the highest wages in the world... And now AI is set to keep it going.","To translate the concept in the image to basketball terms, consider the following analogy:  - **The Middle East (Silicon Valley in the image)**: This would be akin to the hotbeds of basketball talent, such as regions or cities known for producing top players, like New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles.    - **The Majors (Meta, Apple, etc.)**: These are the powerhouse basketball teams, like the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Chicago Bulls, Golden State Warriors, and Miami Heat, that have the most influence and resources.  - **Oil Fields (Data Centers)**: These represent the basketball courts and training facilities where the game is played and players are developed. Just like data is stored in data centers, basketball skills are honed on the courts.  - **OPEC (NVIDIA)**: This would be the governing bodies of basketball, such as the NBA or FIBA, which control the rules and distribution of the sport's resources and influence.  - **The Saudi Crown Prince (NVIDIA's CEO)**: This is akin to influential figures in basketball, such as the NBA Commissioner or team owners who have significant control over the league's operations.  - **The Embargo (Biden)**: This represents league sanctions or rules that can restrict player movements or team actions, like salary caps, trade restrictions, or suspensions.  - **Smugglers (Data Pirates)**: These are like agents or individuals who try to bend the rules, sometimes unethically, to get the best deals or recruit players.  - **Light, Sweet Crude (High-quality data)**: In basketball, this would be the top-tier talent‚Äîelite players who are highly sought after.  - **The Kuwaiti Oilfields (High-value data sources)**: These are the major basketball tournaments and leagues that are highly competitive and valuable, such as the NBA Finals or the NCAA Tournament.  - **Saddam Hussein (Geopolitical figure)**: This would be a controversial figure in basketball, perhaps a player or owner known for being divisive or causing significant disruption.  - **TSMC (TSMC in the image)**: Equivalent to critical elements in basketball like shoe brands (Nike, Adidas), which are essential for the sport but operate in the background.  In summary, the image depicts the tech world and data using the oil industry as an analogy, while the basketball version of this analogy uses teams, players, and governing bodies to represent the same concepts.    chatgpt / ai really is amazing just buy soxl best regards","We don't know, because they get destabilized and fucked by the countries that are run by the 1%",[Where patches of sand are worth more than waterfront property](https://youtu.be/XBaqiNefdIs?t=4),so where do we wsbers come in

wallstreetbets,Jul,1e6ms9z,CrowdStrike is not worth 83 Billion Dollars,"**Thesis**: Crowdstrike is not worth 93 billion dollars (at time of writing).   **Fear**: CrowdStrike is an enterprise-grade employee spying app masquerading as a cloud application observability dashboard.   **OBSERVATIONS**  * The 75th percentile retail investor has a tenuous grasp on ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù, ‚ÄúSoftware Engineering‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù. * The median ‚ÄúCyber Security Analyst‚Äù has a tenuous grasp on ‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù * The median ‚ÄúSoftware Engineer‚Äù has a tenuous grasp on ‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù and ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù * The median retail investor has a tenuous grasp on ‚Äúmarkets‚Äù and ‚Äúliquidity pools‚Äù     **CRITIQUES**  * Corporations could buy CrowdStrike to spy on their own employees.  * CrowdStrike‚Äôs utility is limited- they simply collect all of their customer‚Äôs data and display it on a dashboard.  * CrowdStrike is dangerous in that they have root access to every device(i.e. endpoint) across thousands of firms. * CrowdStrike customers sign up to get their firm‚Äôs data added to a bank which CrowdStrike then has license to use for ‚Äúcorrelation‚Äù * CrowdStrike is a sitting-duck datamine for the FBI/NSA to subpoena.  * CrowdStrike could potentially behave as a propaganda arm of the US government by creating ‚Äúfake hacking stories‚Äù which are un-disprovable.They are able to do this due to information asymmetries in society. * Properly built ‚Äúcloud applications‚Äù have security baked in by virtue of separation of concerns in the ""software supply chain"". (e.g. containerization engine developer is different than the OS developer is different than the Cloud Infrastructure Provider).  * CrowdStrike‚Äôs Falcon product contradicts their own guiding principle of ‚ÄúZero-Trust Security‚Äù.   **COMMENTARY**  * CrowdStrike‚Äôs product includes a ‚Äúclient‚Äù which runs on every ""customer endpoint‚Äù (i.e. company issued laptop). Activity on the company issued laptop is reported to an internal dashboard which only an IT guy + a C-Suite admin have access to. They ALSO offer observability into each component of a business‚Äôs own ‚Äúcloud application‚Äù. * These are 100% different lines of business which can be easily conflated. * CrowdStrike admits that they collect all of a business‚Äô ‚Äúendpoint data'' and they compare it to other data they have to ""draw insights""; this means that every company that hires CrowdStrike is part of a DATA COMMUNE. * It‚Äôs prohibitively hard to hack into a ‚Äúcloud system‚Äù due to few possible entry points * Exfiltrating data as scale is difficult; employees of the company pose a bigger threat than ""threat-actors"". * *Containerize Everything* + *Microservices Architecture* hampers ""lateral movement"".  * Is CrowdStrike compatible with companies that run their IT systems on premises?       *The CrowdStrike Story So Far‚Ä¶*    **2020**  * ‚ÄúUses cloud technology to detect and thwart attempted cybersecurity breaches‚Äù  * ‚ÄúRuns on your endpoint or server or workload‚Äù  * ‚ÄúSignature based technologies don‚Äôt go far enough‚Äù  * ‚ÄúWe collect trillions of events‚Äù   * ‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been a salesforce of security‚Äù   ‚Äî  FAST FORWARD ‚Äî   **2024**  * Palo Alto Networks(100% different business line) is being pitted against CrowdStrike in the media.  * Crowdstrike allegedly offers a poorly differentiated suite of generically titled products: **(Falcon Discover, Falcon Spotlight, Falcon Prevent, Falcon Horizon, Falcon Insight(EDR), Falcon Insight(XDR), Falcon Overwatch, Falcon Complete(MDR), Falcon Cloud Security)**.

Central banks can never again allow borrowing rates to get that low.","Pasting the key part of the article below to save you all some time.   Also some commentary is that this might seem like big numbers but as the article alludes to it's just unrealized treasury holding losses. Yes this could be like Silicon Valley bank, or it could be just normal stuff that solves itself over time. If you believe that rate cuts will happen, and these banks have enough access to working capital, then this is a nothing burger. If you trade treasuries you know that if you can hold it to maturity then there is no losses, that's the key part.  (Granted those four small banks might fail, they don't have the same access to capital).   &gt; "" &gt; Four banks had losses that exceeded their equity capital: Union City SVGS Bank, where unbooked losses equaled 172.7%; Citizens ST Bank, where unbooked losses equaled 121.4%; Green Dot Bank, where unbooked losses equaled 108.6%; and First America TR, where unbooked losses equaled 104%.  &gt; Larger banks on the list with more than $10 billion in equity had unbooked security losses more than their equity capital: Charles Schwab, where unbooked losses equaled 64%; USAA Federal Savings Bank, where unbooked losses equaled 67% of their equity capital; and Bank of America NA, where unbooked losses equaled 58%. &gt; """,Naturally puts.

wallstreetbets,Jul,1dz12ci,Etsy CEO says company is escaping 'race to the bottom' and getting back to its artisan roots,"I‚Äôll admit that I used to like using Etsy for gifts and whatnot, then stopped sometime around the pandemic. I‚Äôm intrigued by this strategy (and more importantly, the marketing of this strategy). Earnings coming first week in August. Its down 30% ytd and ‚Äôm not sure I want to catch the falling knife before earnings- but I think this could be a decent play going into the fall/winter sales cycle.   I haven‚Äôt been following Etsy‚Äôs stock price closely- anyone have thoughts?",[deleted],"Whole heartedly agree that it became trash, which is why I stopped using it. The point of the article is that they are going to try and police that. Though obviously that‚Äôs much easier said than done","It‚Äôs a tough jam for Etsy  They tweaked the definition of ‚Äòhand made‚Äô which unleashed a wave of cheap ‚Äòmade in china‚Äô goods which were in many cases knockoffs of better brands  The original craft sellers got their asses kicked because they couldn‚Äôt compete  And the quality of the items on Etsy fell, because it was knockoff junk from china instead of the handmade stuff. This meant that Etsy was basically the ‚Äòquirky‚Äô Amazon.   So now Etsy is trying to reach out to the artisans to bring them back to the platform.   It‚Äôs a lot easier to sell a generic camera bag for $25 than a craft made artisan camera bag that might cost $100. So the velocity of sales might decrease because the price of items on the platform might rise.   I just feel like Etsy is a fine business but the business model is tough - hand made items inherently cost more, sales velocity is inherently lower, and financial results would be inherently constrained. The hand made, artisan goods market is a much smaller addressable market.  If you open the floodgates to allow manufactured junk, you are nothing more than a quirky Amazon, but the addressable market is much larger.   It‚Äôs really hard to compete against Amazon, Temu; Shein‚Ä¶.  I wouldn‚Äôt invest  (I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not a decent short term trade idea, but I like buy and hold)",Etsy is in a very tough position. Basically spending manpower to reduce available inventory.   Any growth they have from new sellers or new buyers would be incremental.   I just don‚Äôt see how ‚Äúartisan roots‚Äù is a growth model. Seems like they‚Äôre trying to stop the bleeding.,They had a niche no one else filled.  In filling that niche they became successful but had to keep growing and to do that they outgrew the niche market. Killing the niche by filling it in with crap.  Now that no one wants the crap and they have killed the niche as well.  A true curated site like Etsy with gatekeepers might do ok. Maybe.,"Too late, the website is already overrun by cheap Chinese junk. Should've stopped it a longggg time ago. But you wanted money.  Also, consumers are tapped out. No one wants to or can afford to buy a shitty coffee mug decorated by a stay at home mom using a Cricut machine or a shitty looking cutting board with a dog on it. Those days are over.  - Edit..: spelling","I'm a top Etsy seller. I will say there're a lot of new backend features and work being done to modernize the site. I will also say that it's fucked, full of Chinesium, I don't trust management to make the right calls for sellers EVER (they never have, even at their height), and sales have been trending down for more than a year straight and continue to be down. Etsy fails to drive traffic to listings entirely, and a Pro/Con list of Etsy vs Amazon selling isn't necessary, since Etsy's incompetence offers quite literally nothing we need in 2024 to compete in the greater ecomm arena.   I've made hundreds of thousands of dollars on Etsy for the better part of a decade now. I would NEVER in a million years buy ETSY. NEVER.",It was growing well until the junk started popping up iirc  Artists and crafters or whatever got annoyed and discouraged by all the China crap. If they can actually find a way to make it so that can‚Äôt happen anymore and it is actually just handmade stuff I‚Äôm confident that market will return and continue to grow,To me sounds like ‚Äùsmaller and healthier business‚Äù.,The internet's future is high quality gatekeepers because the internet's present is flooded with low quality spam.

wallstreetbets,Jul,1ea75vl,CRWD is going to die.,"Im sure you all saw that video of the microsoft dev telling us why the bug happened. If you havent, Crowdstrike is a virus/malware security company that packaged their program as a ""driver"", so they have access to the kernel. On top of that its a bootable driver, so it loads as soon as you turn on the computer. I cant speak for all drivers, but at least in the case of NVDA driver updates to graphics cards, they have to go through Microsoft testing, which is done by Microsoft to determine it is functional and doesnt cause any issues before providing a certificate to let that driver be published.   As for Crowdstrike, being the incredibly fast and up to the minute protection, they dont have time to do a certificate test to get an approval from microsoft, so they change 1 text file, and push it to all of the machines using their driver. Well on friday, we all saw that driver failed to boot due to an error in the text file. I believe it was a file full of 0's?  Blame the EU for allowing Kernel access in the first place, as they didnt want MSFT to have a monopoly on a virus protector.   What could very well happen in the long term is Crowdstrike will get their kernel access removed, or be required to update their certificate every time they have an update. **Getting their kernel access removed, would make the an average run of the mill virus scanner, and if they are required to update their certificate every time, they would then be behind the ball in terms of protection as a threat would potentially have days/weeks to infiltrate before Crowdstrike gets to update.**   In the short term, I also believe customers will break their contracts and move to competitors.

wallstreetbets,Jul,1eca49y,I spend $4m a year facebook ads and I'm shorting $META earnings,"This is a play based purely on anecdotal experience in the ecommerce space. Here's the anecdotal take:  I started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.  The internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.  Also, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.  In the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying ""AI"" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.  I've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice   Positions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)  EDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:  1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.  2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.  3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.  There's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose. That's gambling you pussies.","OP might be on top of something   My personal experience with FB, I get so many ads and a bunch of suggested posts, sometimes more than actual posts, it's unusable at this point",Big picture is that $4M/year still goes into Facebook‚Äôs pockets and you have nowhere else to go but spend more,This is true it‚Äôs terrible nowadays,But he‚Äôs probably spending less now.

That is index of small caps and it is up 10% in just July alone. The market is predicting rate cuts, which means the risk of small caps will go down. The market is now willing to take on the risk of these smaller companies, so they are selling tech to buy smaller companies.   Small caps are historically very volatile, but provide excellent returns in the long run. US small caps have beat the S&amp;P 500 by like 3% annually (on average) for as long as we have data.

In 2015, he said Tesla‚Äôs cars would achieve ‚Äûfull autonomy‚Äú within three years. In 2016, Musk said Tesla would be able to send one of its cars on a cross-country drive without requiring any human intervention by the end of the following year.  The empty promises continued into 2019, when Musk said on a call with institutional investors that Tesla would have one million robotaxi-ready vehicles on the road in 2020. However, the company has yet to deliver a robotaxi, autonomous vehicle or technology that can turn its cars into ‚Äûlevel 3‚Äú automated vehicles. Meanwhile, companies such as Alphabet‚Äôs Waymo and Cruise, owned by General Motors, have leaped ahead of Tesla‚Äú  7 years overdue but Elmo‚Äôs fellowship still believes.",So the answer is no,Nah the employees don‚Äôt even know of any deadline themselves.

Left me $800k inheritance. I'm only a junior in college as a math major and I don't really have any use for the money, nor do I have any debt (I'm very fortunate that my parents are paying for my education). I always heard about people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing. So I told my parents I'm not going to spend a cent of this money and I'm going to invest all of it and they were proud of me. I put 100k into a high yield savings account and bought 700k worth of Intel stock at market open. I plan on holding this for a decade depending on how it performs.   Here's why I like Intel:   - 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY   - Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies.   - With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow.   - I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&amp;D funding.   - If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China &amp; Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD   - Intel has been heavily investing in R&amp;D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&amp;D.   - Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024  - The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models.   - Trading at Forward PE of 17.05   - Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry   - I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)",This may be one of the best comebacks in WSB history!,Did op delete his account?,"On the surface, OP did his DD.","5 months later he lost half his value, get fucked",Press F to pay your respects,"300 shares, average 30$.

wallstreetbets,Aug,1ekjk06,A tldr of what‚Äòs been happening on the market.,"The sharp rise in the JPY/USD is causing a massive unwind of Yen carry trade positions and contributing to the sharp decline in US stocks. For those who do not understand how this works, a brief explanation  1) Many traders were borrowing Jap Yen (JPY) at low interest rates, converted them to USD and used this to buy US stocks  2) Now that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is raising interest rates, the JPY has strengthened significantly against the USD.   Now, these traders are in big shit. Not only must they pay higher interest for the JPY they borrowed, they are now facing huge forex losses as well. The USD assets they are holding may not be enough to repay the JPY they have borrowed.   3) This is causing a huge unwind of these trade positions. Traders facing big losses and margin calls are selling their US stocks to raise USD, converting back to JPY and paying back their loans.   4) This can lead to more selling pressure on US stocks and even more declines in the short term.

At first I didn't really listen to these ppl because I was up a little bit on my positions, but then copper started mooning in price and i was down thousands out of nowhere, so I doubled down on my position thinking there was no way it could go higher and I took out some margin and bought more puts on a different strike price to average down, but it kept going higher. Currently I'm down about -$8.5k on my shorts.   Since I only had about $400 of cash in my account left I decided to play around with 0DTE SPY options, I made a little money back initially, but then I woke up today and checked my account and somehow there was a naked call in my account that I didn't even buy, I was only trading long calls and puts but somehow it was in my portfolio and said that i needed to buy 100 shares of SPY as collateral immediately before it closes. I have no idea how this got there, I tried switching to a cash account but it said I had to close my margin positions first, so as the market closed, it automatically bought 100 shares of SPY and now I owe $56k to my brokerage. Im only 19 and essentially my life is ruined and I have no idea what to do or how I can ever repay this, I haven't even told my mom or dad.","Why would the price of copper crash because of Olympic medals? This is next-level idiocy, holy shit",You weren‚Äôt assigned and didn‚Äôt need to buy SPY to cover it. The outcome is that you‚Äôll sell the SPY you bought and will make or lose the difference. You aren‚Äôt down $56k+,"I get that it‚Äôs extremely funny, but this should be top comment. People have killed the selves over this shit. Thank you for addressing the issue.",The only reason why I follow this sub is to read shit like this.,"like others have said, you are not down 56k. if your option gets exercised, the broker will buy the underlying and sell it. but also spy closed below that, even if it got exercised unless your broker is shit, you‚Äôd be buying spy at ~563 and selling it at 567 to whoever exercised the option.   if this was a 567 naked put, you‚Äôd buy the shares at 567 and the broker would sell them back at market price (563 or w.e it‚Äôs at)   also, if this isn‚Äôt a wake up call nothing will be. stop fucking around. gamble responsibly.","Well, you see.   It's almost autumn, and it's still hot.   Gourds don't grow well in the heat.   They have a very limited window in their growth period to mature thick enough rinds in order to be marketable.   If the weather stays too hot for too long, farmers end up with decorative gourds that can't be sold.   That limited supply means extra high premiums for the gourd markets in Kansas.   Kansas and copper both start with a hard ""C/K"" sound and have a rich orange color.   Thus, you short copper and European gourds.",I saw OP's original post on this and figured it was humour.

wallstreetbets,Aug,1ema5ue,Update: I spent a quarter million dollars on rocks. ,"**Previous Post:**¬†  [~https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xqubya/my\_dd\_advocating\_a\_long\_position\_of\_gemstone/~](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xqubya/my_dd_advocating_a_long_position_of_gemstone/)  **Summary:** For the last four years I have been buying rocks, a lot of rocks. My hypothesis is that these rocks will dramatically appreciate in value due to an increased market awareness, combined with geopolitical and socio-economic transference.¬†¬†¬†  **Introduction:** In March 2020, when the entire world was preparing for a global pandemic, I decided it was a good idea to take a vacation to Cambodia. At the time, everyone around me was telling me, this was perhaps not a very good idea. A risky idea, an idea with more downsides than up. A poor investment. I rejected this advice, and convinced my girlfriend to come with me. Four days after we arrived, the world was locked down and all the hotels in the country were closed. Our new home for the foreseeable future was in an empty resort in the most remote corner of Cambodia.¬†  It was here where I [~discovered Blue Zircon.~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_BOLj3xlWDkaT2rC6LCi1RqpgBHG4iu/view?usp=sharing)  **A deep value asset:** With all the time in the world, nowhere to be and nothing to do, I spent every waking moment learning everything I could about this curious rock. I came to the conclusion that [~Blue Zircon was woefully undervalued and primed for exponential growth.~](https://youtu.be/kwprPvO-YD4?si=biaxx0hxBFFeIr9g)  At the time, you could visit the mines outside of town and buy a fist full of raw unfaceted blue zircon for around $0.30 per stone. This was to be my cost basis moving forward.¬†  What initially got my attention was:¬†  1. [~Blue Zircon is the oldest gemstone on Earth.~¬†](https://www.science.org/content/article/oldest-piece-earth-discovered) 2.

Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.  You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs. You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus.  And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have to us who think and reason? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake? You are a waste of flesh.  You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile.

You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on.  This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half-baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective.  True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ""normal"" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ""challenged"" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been ""right"". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.  You're an idiot. A moron of the highest order. You're so stupid it's a wonder and a pity you can remember to breath. Intelligent ideas bounce off your head as if it were coated with teflon. Creative thoughts take alternate transportation in order to avoid even being in the same state as you. If you had an original thought it would die of loneliness before the hour was out. On an intelligence scale of 1 to 10 (10 corresponding to the highest attainable IQ) you're rating is so far into negative numbers that one would need to travel into another quantum reality in order to even catch a distant glimpse of it.  Your personality is that of a rabid Chihuahua intent on destroying its own tail. Your powers of observation are akin to those of the bird that keeps slamming into the picture window trying to get that other bird it keeps seeing. You are walking, talking proof that you don't have to be sentient to survive, and that Barnum was thinking of you when he uttered his immortal phrase regarding the birth of a sucker. You are, at varying times, tedious, boring, and even occasionally earth shatteringly hilarious in your idiocy, routinely childish, moronic, pathetic, wretched, disgusting and pitiful.  You are wholly without any redeeming social grace or value. If God ever decides to give the planet an enema you'd better run like the wind because anywhere you stand is a suitable place for The Insertion. There is no animal so disgusting, so vile that it deserves comparison to you, for even the lowest, dirtiest, most parasitic member of the animal kingdom fills an ecological niche. You fill no niche. To call you a parasite would be injurious and defamatory to the thousands of honest parasitic species. You are worse than vermin, for vermin do not pretend to be what it is not. You are truly human garbage. You are a fraudulent, lying, predatory charlatan. You are of less worth than a burnt-out light bulb. You will forever live in shame.  You have nothing to say, and Godwin's Law does not apply when writing about you. You are the anti-Midas, for all that you touch becomes valueless and unusable. Mothers gather their children close when you appear. You are an aberration, a corruption, and a boil that needs to be lanced. You are a poison in need of being vomited. You are a tooth so rotten it infects the whole body. You are sperm that should have been captured in a condom and flushed down a toilet.  I don't like you. I don't like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do. Go away, you swine. You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon. You are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world.

And also, if you're fine with being evil, that road is equally unworkable.   The McMansions piece is also super interesting to me. Like we're conditioned to want a garage and three extra bedrooms, that's somehow the trophy for middle class success. But all of my favorite neighborhoods to visit barely have any houses like that. I think if an enterprising developer created a mixed use set of condos, apartments, small houses, and townhomes all situated around a grocery store, a few nice shops, and a third place, without roads, a lot of people would love that. I mean like, actually walkable, everything inside a half mile, it's easier to walk around than it is to drive. Maybe I'm a eurocentric beta cuck for thinking that people would enjoy their lives more if they were sharing a space with neighbors.","I agree 100%. I live in an old neighborhood beside a lake myself, a development that was built in the 40's. We all share a well, and have meetings once a year or so to deal with upkeep and the money side of it. I know all my neighbors and we're all pretty cordial, it's nice. The one thing my area lacks is a grocery store - have to go three miles for one of those. There used to be little one a mile away but the county reg'd it out of existence, enforcing strict zoning rules.","I have all my money in various investment accounts and use my credit card for all my purchases. I think I have a debit card but I have never used it in 8 years.   At the end of each month I use my wage to pay off my cards and deposit the rest into the investment account. Never accrue interest. Earlier this year my history of consistent payment allowed me to get a low interest loan on a car. So rather than have to pay $20,000 cash I just pay the 5% interest while my cash makes 8-10% in the investment account. I really wouldn't need a bank account other than to write checks from on occasion.

What kinda inefficient ship is GS running,"Because Apple users that qualified were super responsible and low risk. So people like me that pay off their balance every month in total just wreck them on the cash back. Credit card companies only make money off that sick 28% interest rate the majority of people don‚Äôt pay off   Edit*** apparently my experience and the people I know with the card definitely differed from the reality as I knew people that had gotten rejected with good credit but I guess there are a ton of reasons for their struggles. Copy and paste from an article last year on reuters .  Short version is too many unpaid balances, forced to accept too many applicants , diminished or no fees, all bills posting on the same day(first of the month), very little experience dealing with non wealthy individuals. Apologies for not having done enough research.   ‚ÄúNew credit card businesses typically lose money in their early years, in part because regulations require banks to set aside about 7% of projected sales to cover expected losses, said Warren Kornfeld, senior vice president at Moody‚Äôs Investors Service. Goldman was responsible for setting aside the provisions for credit losses instead of sharing them with Apple, according to the two sources familiar with the business. The Apple card also posed an underwriting challenge. Goldman‚Äôs clients are typically wealthy individuals, and it had little experience making loans to less-affluent customers, according to analysts. As the two companies sought to boost revenue, they granted cards to customers with lower credit scores, according to one of the sources familiar with the situation. As Goldman set aside more money for bad loans, the paper losses for its consumer business mounted, according to earnings filings. The companies also tried to tempt new customers with the promise of ‚Äúno annual fees, foreign transaction fees, or late fees,‚Äù Apple said on its website. They also introduced high-yield savings accounts for card holders in April, enabling Goldman to gather $10 billion of deposits by August, Apple said at the time.‚Äù",It‚Äôs also REALLY clear when/how much to pay which is very consumer friendly.,Banks hate this one simple trick,"&gt; The card, launched in 2019, was one of the hallmarks of Goldman‚Äôs retail strategy. Apple and Goldman granted cards to customers with lower credit scores in an attempt to boost revenue, a source told Reuters last year.  &gt; The card offered perks like ‚Äúno fees‚Äù and cashback. But Goldman had to set aside bigger provisions for bad loans, leading to higher paper losses for its consumer business.  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-talks-apple-over-credit-162348300.html",i just got a GS Apple Card. üòÇ,Finally GS got owned ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883),"&gt; I have a lot of credit cards.

Like for most of 2015 the 10 year Treasury notes were going for between 2 and 2.5%. Now the ten year yield is 3.7%. That represents a 40-80% increase in yield as things stand now on the same level of debt.   So there is all this old debt getting refinanced, so to speak, and then probably $2T in new debt, $5-10t  total in debt getting a new rate next year, the bond yield and therefore the prime rate being as low as possible is crucial. Probably of greater long term importance to the country than if we enter a recession or not.    Then there are also corporate junk bonds. Even large cap companies don't have the same resources to rack up debt like the US government. We are addicted to near zero rate and now that inflation has cooled the Fed is gonna try to get back to near zero asap.","A full point drop after it's been high and steady for so long is pretty concerning.

wallstreetbets,Sep,1frs7js,why the economy is doomed. A samsclub paper towel perspective.,"Hello, thanks for taking the time to read this due diligence on the economy.  Over the last 4 years I have gone to my local samsclub to purchase paper towels over 800 times. every week for 4 years, I purchased a 12 pack of bounty select a size paper towel.   During covid paper towel like toilet paper became a rare resources. It was not guarenteed that the economy could produce enough to sustain the paper towel needs of the citizens. This lead to the terrible pratice of hoarding paper towl and while sad, was very bullish for the economy in general.  After witnessing this sad pratice of hoarding I began to realise that the broader market could be tracked (in generalities) by following how much paper towel my local sams club could keep in stock. I keep track of this number by creating an acronym for these amounts of paper towel stored on pallets at the previously mentioned club.   S.P.T.P Sams club paper towel pallets. (by creating this acronym I have saved not only myself time while writing, but also you time while reading)  Back during the covid days my local samsclub rarely had more than 2 s.p.t.p delivered a week. buying paper towel was hit or miss. As the economy recovered this increased to a more reliable 4 s.p.t.p.  Now we come to the crux of this post. s.p.t.p remained steady in the 2 to 10 range for the last 3 or so years. Untill this very week. I counted over 45 s.p.t.p on rakes strewn throughout the store. Which leads me (and you if you have even an average IQ) to 1 conclusion.   No one has extra money to buy paper towel anymore. The economy is toast. Over. To say the world is ending is not even one tiny bit of an exageration.  On monday I will sell every asset I own and fullport into week puts on whatever sector produces paper towels.   I hope you have the sense to follow this amazing play to prevent ultimate finacial ruin to me (and you)  Thanks again for reading. Best of luck out there.   Edit. As we enter a new week I wanted to thank everyone who replied to this post. Especially the humorous ones that gave me some great laughs. I even learned a few things too. Cheers fellow degens.",how much gooning do you have to do to use a 12 pack of paper towels a week?,Tell me more about how you go through a 12pack of paper towel every week.,They and their family shower twice a day and don't use paper towels instead of bath towels.,"Isn't it possible that some new dipshit ordering manager or ordering system change  just ordered way too much paper towels?

GTFO ASAP.    Just get out! Stay safe. Your life is more important than any material possession. God protect you all.  2nd off.   Two major hurricanes hitting roughly the same area just weeks apart is going to multiply the devastation.

Oil prices are already up significantly since the Iran missile attack and hurricane Helene just in the last couple of weeks.   Expect energy prices to stay higher for longer.  Hurricane Helene is estimated to have caused so far 50 billion dollars in damages. These losses are expected to be compounded by Milton.

Tesla will have to run their own fleet which will increase costs, maintenance etc.  2.  Percentage of people willing to take a robotaxi daily are low; like Uber.  3.  Costs are astronomical when you add up all your daily trips.  I take approximately 8-10 trips a day, sometimes more on the weekends.  For example: $7 per trip.  Add up all your daily roundtrips: commute , school, activities , leisure, Home Depot, Starbucks, McDonald‚Äôs, mall, family visits, etc.  $60-80 per day= $1500+ per month.  Why not just own a car at that price?  4.

wallstreetbets,Oct,1gai1a7,$TSLA: The DD of a lifetime. ,"Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let‚Äôs crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think.   1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later). 2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event. 3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator.   Keeping all of this in mind, this isn‚Äôt even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports.   On the day of Tesla‚Äôs Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks.   On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn‚Äôt tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%.   Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he‚Äôs in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall.   Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today?   *15 fucking times*.   You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That‚Äôs triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn‚Äôt, and he‚Äôs letting us know right below our own nose!   All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I‚Äôm betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late.   This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you.   Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I‚Äôll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th.   *note*: This is NOT financial advice.

wallstreetbets,Oct,1g5vmh9,Housing Bubble Coming,"So I work as a housing counselor, trying to help first time home buyers purchase homes. This last year I‚Äôve been seeing ridiculously high mortgage payments clients getting approved for. Well above the standard 30% Housing Ratio, 44% DTIv ratios conventional mortgages demand. Speaking with a lender today, turns out Freddie/Fannie have really relaxed guidelines around Housing Ratio. So people are getting conventional loans with up to 50% Housing Ratio! (Which means 1/2 of someone‚Äôs Gross monthly income is going to their Mortgage). This reminds me so much of pre -2008. These loans are totally unaffordable. I‚Äôve seen clients making less than me taking on payments $1,000 more than my Mortgage. And I‚Äôm not wealthy or crushing it by any means. Bottom line- there‚Äôs going to be massive foreclosure rates coming in the next 1-5 years. Not sure how best to play it at this time though.",Only if they lose their job.

Banks have learned from 2008 and the old lending practices was to take a house as collateral and then sell it as soon as they foreclose to get back as much as possible. This is what crashed the market in the first place.   From that you will realize that banks have started changing their practices. Before banks were not in the business of owning houses. You will notice that has changed, one of the big buyers of residential real estate today are funds and banks and they are renting them out. Corporate home buyer ship is up overall.   Secondly if you have been studying the market over the years you will see that foreclosures are down, that does not mean that defaults were always down, starting about 2010 the banks realized that if they dumped inventory onto the market they lose money so they started keeping shadow inventories of things and allowing people to stay in their houses longer. Banks are not doing this out of the kindness of their hearts, somewhere along the road they realized they could recoup their money by controlling inventory and selling at a more opportune time, and they realized probably during this time they could rent out the inventory which lead to above.

""Stock buybacks and layoffs are joined at the hip. It's time they were outlawed entirely.""  &gt;The manufacturing giant Boeing, under the leadership of new CEO Kelly Ortberg, announced Friday that it will axe roughly 10% of its total workforce in the coming months, a move that drew attention to the company's massive spending on stock buybacks in recent years.  &gt;Boeing, which is currently facing a machinist strike, spent an estimated $68 billion on executive-enriching share repurchases and dividends between 2010 and 2019‚Äîspending that critics say refutes the company's claim that layoffs and inadequate worker compensation are necessary.",I‚Äôm sure none of these layoffs took place in quality control‚Ä¶,"Boeing had such an amazing year they paid their CEO $30 million plus - This is being tone deaf on a whole new level.

wallstreetbets,Oct,1g51fj0,Get in on Uranium Now,"**Since 2020, the price of uranium has gone from $21/lb to a high of $106/lb in Feb 2024. The price has experienced a slight pull back since then to $83/lb. I believe this 4-5x change in the price of uranium to be small compared to what lies ahead, and I will explain the reasons why in this paper.**¬†  **What is Uranium?**  Uranium is an abundant, radioactive metal naturally occurring in earth's crust. The vast purpose of it today is used for creating nuclear fuel to provide energy. It is one of the cleanest burning fuels and very easy on the environment. Think of Uranium as a gas pump, there are different options you can choose between based on grade. We will focus on the two main isotopes for Uranium. When it is mined, approximately 99.3% is uranium-238 and 0.7% is uranium-235.  U-238 is a critical component of plutonium production which in itself gives a TON of demand. The major application of Uranium in the military sector is depleted Uranium (DU). DU is mostly U-238 after U-235 has been removed. It is used to create armor piercing rounds and military projectiles. The high density of DU makes weapons highly effective. There are other important uses of U-238, such as counterbalancing aircraft, though we are not focusing on those.  U-235 is even more important because for the most part, this is what fuels nuclear reactors. In order to power a nuclear reactor, the concentration of U-235 needs to be 3-5% instead of 0.7%. The higher concentration makes it fissionable, meaning it can power light-water reactors which are the most common reactor design in the USA (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission). One kilogram (2.2 LBS) of U-235 produces as much energy as 3,306,930 pounds of coal.  **HALEU**  High-assay low-enriched uranium. A crucial material needed to deploy advanced nuclear reactors. Currently, HALEU is not commercially available from US based suppliers. Boosting domestic supply could spur the development of advanced reactors in the US (Energy.gov). In November, the DOE reached a key milestone under its HALEU demonstration project, when a company produced the nation‚Äôs first 20 kilograms of HALEU. Thus, providing a first of its kind production in the United States in more than 70 years. Amid growing efforts to secure a reliable domestic nuclear fuel supply, the DOE has awarded contracts to six companies as part of an $800 million initiative to bolster the deconversion of high-assay low-enriched uranium (Roan, 2024).  The existing fleet of US reactors run on enriched uranium up to 5% with U-235. However, most advanced reactors require HALEU which is enriched between 5% to 20% in order to achieve smaller and more versatile designs with the highest standards of safety, security and nonproliferation. HALEU also allows developers to optimize their systems for longer life cores, increased efficiencies, and better fuel utilization. Together, the US, Canada, France, Japan and the UK have announced collective plans to mobilize $4.2 billion in government-led spending to develop safe and secure nuclear energy supply chains (Energy.gov).¬†  As we now know, enriched uranium is crucial. Although, the enrichment process is very costly. Russia is the biggest player in the enrichment process. They are responsible for roughly 44% of the world‚Äôs enrichment capacity and supply approximately 35% of imported nuclear fuel to the US. As of August 12th, 2024, Uranium imports into the USA from Russia are outlawed. This allows $2.7 billion in funding to build out the U.S uranium industry specifically, to increase production of LEU and HALEU. The DOE estimates that US utilities have roughly 3 years of LEU available through existing inventory or pre-existing contracts. To ensure no plants are disrupted, a waiver process is in order to allow some imports of LEU from Russia to continue for a limited time. ‚ÄúIn the meantime, we‚Äôre taking aggressive steps to establish a secure and reliable uranium supply market‚Äù (Energy.gov).¬†  **Uranium Supply**  Now, the supply that was once held of uranium is running out. ‚ÄúThe inventory overhang that was so damaging to the market for almost a decade has been largely consumed, and going forward, we‚Äôre going to have an increasing reliance on primary supply‚Äù (World Nuclear News). Idled mines are now starting production again, as well as increases in mines under development, and planned mines. ‚ÄúThere is no doubt that sufficient uranium resources exist to meet future needs, but producers have been waiting for the market to rebalance before starting to invest in new capacity and bring idled capacity back into operation. This is now happening (World Nuclear News).  The uranium market has been facing a supply deficit for years due to underinvestment. The problem is that uranium mines take a long time and require a ton of capital to get up and running. A mine can take 10-15 years to begin production AFTER they are opened.¬†  As with other minerals, investment in geological exploration generally results in increased known resources. Over 2005 and 2006, exploration efforts resulted in the world‚Äôs known uranium resources increasing by 15% (World Nuclear Association). Therefore, there is no need to anticipate any uranium shortage.The world‚Äôs current measured resources of uranium will last about 90 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. There is nearly limitless supply because most of it has not been discovered due to little investment in mining and exploration. To be clear, although we know this uranium exists, that does not mean it has been mined.¬†  Primary Supply - This type of supply refers to uranium extracted directly from mining.The primary supply has been under heavy pressure in recent years due to low uranium prices. Low prices lead to reduced mining operations. This is because mining is incredibly expensive and companies won‚Äôt do it if there is no good price incentive at which they could sell the uranium. It is forecasted that uranium mining will not meet the reactor demands for at least 15 years. Now, it is also estimated that by 2035, primary uranium production will decrease by 30% due to resource depletion and mine closures. New mines will only be able to compensate for the capacity of the exhausted mines.  Secondary Supply - This refers to all uranium that is not sourced directly from mining but from other inventories and recycled materials. This includes, civil stockpiles, military stockpiles, recycled uranium and enrichment tails. Civil stockpiles (uranium reserves held by utilities, hedge funds, and government) grew immensely after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Many reactors shut down due to the worries surrounding uranium, and investment in the nuclear sector decreased. Due to this, there was a large oversupply of uranium. Since then, these stockpiles have been largely drawn upon to meet reactor demand, instead of relying on primary supply. So, utilities have been relying on their inventory to fuel their reactors, instead of getting fresh uranium from mines. This has caused a gradual depletion of their reserves. There is no mathematical way to rely on reserves anymore. The ONLY option is to produce uranium in order to keep reactors operational, while meeting future demand.  **Uranium Demand**¬†  The United States, China, and France represent around 58% of global uranium demand. Uranium demand can be characterized as a predictable function of the number of operating nuclear power plants, their capacity factors and fuel burn up levels. As of April 30th, 2024, there are 94 operating nuclear reactors in the United States. The global count of operating nuclear reactors is 440. These account for 9% of the world's electricity. Currently, there are 60 nuclear reactors in production across 16 countries spanning into 2030. About 90 more reactors have been planned and over 300 have been proposed.¬†  Looking ten years ahead, the uranium market is expected to grow. The 2023 World Nuclear Association‚Äôs Nuclear Fuel Report shows a 28% increase in uranium demand over 2023-2030. This same report predicts a 51% increase in uranium demand for the decade 2031-2040. Global demand for electricity may rise 165% by 2050 while at the same time, 101 countries have committed to net-zero carbon emission goals and are actively pursuing a shift to clean energy.    https://preview.redd.it/ld8y5xf7u4vd1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cd6d742feca0b2df30d583972a4ed949e064941  **Global Price of Uranium Last 25 Years (USD/Lbs)**    **Uranium Production**  The main producers of uranium are Kazakhstan, Canada, Namibia, Australia, and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan is the major producer. In 2022, they produced 43% of the world‚Äôs uranium. The company Kazatomprom is responsible for the massive production within the country. Very big news came out recently stating they have slashed their production target for 2025 by 17%. This is due to project delays and sulfuric acid shortages (a critical component of uranium extraction). They are expected to produce 25,000-26,500 tonnes of yellowcake (a concentrated form of uranium ore produced during the early stage of processing).This move is likely to continue the upward pressure on uranium prices. This slash in production is occurring while Kazatomprom has their lowest reported uranium inventory levels since 1997 of 4,142 tonnes of uranium, down 31% from the previous year (Dempsey, 2024). ‚ÄúThis is a structural problem. It won‚Äôt just be the west saying this is an issue for us; it will also be Russia and China saying it‚Äôs a problem for our new nuclear power plants‚Äù (Nick Lawson, CEO of Ocean Wall).¬†    Uranium prices have been low for decades due to oversupply and stockpiles. This has made it less appealing to develop new mines and instead, rely on existing mines and supply. However, the US and other countries are showing increased signs of uranium mining at an alarming rate. In the first quarter of 2024, the United States produced more than 82,000 LBS of uranium which is more than the entire 2023 production. In Q2 of¬† 2024, production increased to 97,709 LBS, an 18% increase from Q1 2024. While this increased production is significant for a domestic supply, it does not begin to put a dent in the global deficit. It simply goes to show the US is beginning their own production of uranium.¬†    https://preview.redd.it/0i0y5ta8u4vd1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fea4c5c8d96e63e0991cbee91763b86ffdd1d513  **United States Uranium Production 2000-2024 Q2 lbs**    In a recent interview with Justin Huhn, a uranium market expert, he stated, ‚ÄúYTD there has been 54 million pounds contracted. Demand pulled back temporarily and when that happened, price kept rising. It's a hugely important indicator that when demand comes back in, which it is starting to, the prices are going higher. We're starting to see early signs of that. Honestly, I think we are on the cusp of a very large movement in the coming weeks. We're going to see a competitive environment for limited supply. That's what is coming next. The ceiling in the contracts tells you where the price is going. The 3 and 5 year forward tells you where the spot is going. Every piece of evidence in the physical market is telling us that prices are going higher.""  ""Companies need uranium and they aren't going to not buy it at price xyz. Now, could we get to a point where logically the price of uranium utility does not justify continued operations? That's possible. And unless we have a balanced market, that might be the limiting upside factor. Price would have to be somewhere in the $700s for the average utility to not afford to buy uranium in order to operate their facilities.‚Äù    https://preview.redd.it/tryxvqs8u4vd1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d232e82dee2be8fcd1a85af980584987b2bcb4d  **World Uranium Production vs Reactor Requirements, 1945-2022 tU**    # Conclusion¬†  Although we‚Äôve seen drastic changes in the price of uranium already, I believe the bull market is just beginning. There is immense demand, and production simply can‚Äôt meet the requirements. Prospective mines can take 10-15 years to become operational, while 30% of current mines are estimated to be depleted by 2035. There is not enough time available for the uranium supply to meet the demand despite increases in production. Companies are willing and obligated to secure nuclear fuel at almost any price. Increased investment into nuclear energy is happening from a governmental side and big tech. Amazon, Microsoft and Google have all come out with news recently, investing insane amounts into nuclear. Countries are uniting in the fight against climate change to establish a global supply of clean, zero-carbon energy. Therefore, I believe that as the supply continues to dwindle and demand continues to increase, the fight for uranium that will ensue is going to send the price to levels we have never before seen in history.¬†  **Investment Ideas**  I think mining companies are best set up to gain from this market. A high uranium price means they earn higher revenues by selling it. This also allows them to further develop mines and explore new areas, increasing overall production. We are in a seller dominated market where prices are based on bidding wars between utilities, governments, and hedge funds. These mining companies are Cameco (CCJ) currently trading at $50.86 and NexGen Energy (NXE) trading at $7.26. I also like the mining ETF Range Nuclear Renaissance Index (NUKZ) trading at $38.31 and Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) trading at $48.26. The other companies I like in this sector are Clean Harbors, Inc. trading at $257.48 and Constellation Energy (CEG) trading at $265.86. Clean Harbors has a dominant position in the market for the handling and disposal of nuclear waste. They also have very good management. I‚Äôd say they are my favorite pick out of the entire sector. Aware that this is WSB, YOLO calls on URNM is the play.¬†This is a chance to create generational wealth.  **Disclaimer**¬†  **This is not financial advice.**",[deleted],Too many words.

wallstreetbets,Nov,1gm4gzv,YOLO $35k into 1.1MM to save the family farm. ,"Fellow regards, longtime lurker breaking the silence to YOLO $32K to save the family farm.  Grandaddy died in April this year leaving a 3 generation farm, (fully paid, no debt) to my parents. Mom never worked and my dad‚Äôs income has never been much (minister at small church). Unsurprisingly, mom and dad want to cash in on that sweet sweet inheritance $$$ by selling the farm and upgrading their lifestyle with the proceeds.  I would give my right kidney to keep that farm if I knew how to sell it. It‚Äôs where I grew up, convinced my girlfriend (now wife) to marry me, and want our two small children to make their own memories there.   I‚Äôve traded positions in $NVDA, $ASTS, $RKLB and $RDDT (thanks to this community) hoping to somehow make enough to buy the farm but have only managed roughly to double my money ($15K to $32K). I completely realize it‚Äôs an idiot move but it‚Äôs the only chance I have at this point and I‚Äôm 100% willing to go to $0 if there is a chance I can make it to $1.1MM.   The farm is going to be listed next week and I want to go full regard with my portfolio to buy it. If I sell my house I still need $1.1MM to make up the difference and I‚Äôm willing to bet everything I have in the market for the chance to make it happen.   Would happily go all-in on anything that might print before February since the farm will probably be sold around that time.   Before anyone asks, there is no other way. My folks want the $$$ now and won‚Äôt sell the farm for any less than market value to me or anyone else. Renting the tillable acres to a local farmer would only cover 1.5 months of the mortgage payment. Maybe the best offer is $800K, maybe the real estate market crashes tomorrow, but bottom line is I have to close the gap between $35K and $1.1MM to have any shot at keeping it.

wallstreetbets,Nov,1grqiw1,Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.,"1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs. 2. The US EV manufacturers are starved out, and Tesla is the only surviving US EV maker - I quote ""Tesla does not depend on subsidies"". 3. Tesla increases its US EV market share, seemingly as the only car manufacturer without risk of discontinuity. 4. Nonetheless, Tesla delivery numbers remain stagnant despite increased US market share due to lowering overall EV sales. 5. Tesla now monopolises the US EV market, significantly diluting the need to compete. 6. US import tariffs are now in full effect. Imported parts are too expensive, and cost-cutting is prioritised. Tesla's costly R&amp;D takes a backseat. 7. China, Korea and the Germans retaliate by imposing tariffs on Tesla imports, crippling Tesla's global market EV share. 8. Chinese, Korean and German EV makers continue to improve EV capabilities in a 3-cornered fight, widening the tech gap to Tesla. 9. The difference in EVs has now become more apparent. Tesla now lacks value for money and is no longer relevant to the global market. The US is dethroned as a major EV leader. 10. Tesla now struggles to sustain revenue growth without the global market. It now struggles to justify its colossal trillion-dollar valuation. Tesla needs to milk the already-drying US harder, somehow. 11. A new generation of Tesla bagholders is created.","Good news, TSLA has nothing to do with Tesla inc.","Most true comment on this thread, the stock is in fairy tale land, normal logic does not apply.",[deleted],Do I hate Musk?

wallstreetbets,Nov,1h2y4dg,Finally Hit $100k in Robinhood After Years of Grind,"First post ever on Reddit albeit a long one so buckle up fellow degens! Been lurking for 6 years, finally made a new Reddit account to share this milestone. Started this journey back in 2017 in Robinhood, rode the highs and lows, and at one point even saw my portfolio drop to just ~$1K back in July 2022 (see screenshot #2) . But here we are in 2024, looking at ~$110k and up $47k (~76%) all-time! (Still quite can‚Äôt beat the benchmark yet; SPY‚Äôs got me outpaced in the long term ü•≤)  The Ups and Downs  Looking back, it‚Äôs been one heck of a rollercoaster. As you can see in my all-time chart, there were some major dips along the way. The journey wasn‚Äôt linear; there were times when I felt like the portfolio was just bleeding out, but I stuck with it, made some strategic moves, and kept adding funds whenever possible.   After starting with the modest account balance of about roughly 18k back in Q4 2017, I steadily added funds to my portfolio over time, especially after seeing triple digit returns in NVDA, SQ and double digit gains in bunch of blue chip stocks; held some Chinese stocks like Luckin Coffee (before it got delisted from NASDAQ) . Got the account to a decent level. Then went completely ‚Äòregard‚Äô and got into options üòÖ. Did well initially then hit the rock bottom reaching as low as $998 (see aforementioned screenshot #2). Added about 9-12k over next few months (see screenshot #3) to be able to trade again. No options but used margin money to almost double my account first. Then, as the bull market kicked in after bottoming out in October 2023, the account continued to rise. Later, I employed slightly more aggressive options strategies to reach my current position.  Key Moves  The past 18 months have been all about- researching a shit ton (more!) and making mostly informed decisions mixing with some gut feeling, using Reddit (of course), stocktwits, yahoo finance, various research firms, reports, interviews, Fidelity, CNBC, etc  Current Portfolio includes:  ‚Ä¢	PLTR, bunch of Semi stocks including NVDA, TSM. ‚Ä¢	Blue Chips (duh!)  ‚Ä¢	Growth stocks like SOFI, SQ,   ‚Ä¢	ETFs and a few dividend/yield stocks like QQQ, IJH, XLE, JPEQ, etc.  ‚Ä¢	Credit Put Spreads, LEAPS, CSPs, and CCs 	‚Ä¢	PLTR and semi stocks, plus bluechi Missed out on a 10x gain on NVDA (sold too early); funny enough never went long on TSLA or got into some of the group‚Äôs fav stonks from back in 2020-21 (you know which ones üí™üèΩ), but holding PLTR since 2020 has been solid. I also hold stuff long term on other platforms- Fidelity and Webull including most of my PLTR shares. Can‚Äôt go full degen and YOLO everything just on Robinhood alone; you gotta diversify üò≠  Shoutout to all the legends here on WallStreetBets for the crazy ideas, inspiration, and advice. Couldn‚Äôt have done it without this community! Here‚Äôs to even bigger gains ahead. Let‚Äôs keep riding this wave together!",Congrats. Now I'm looking at what SPY did since 2017  ...

They‚Äôre both honestly very inexpensive, but unless you have a reason to stay with SPY, go VOO.   You can options trade both of them. Options traders like SPY more because the volume is much greater, allowing for easier sells and buys since there‚Äôs many more customers.  Volume: 3.6 million for VOO vs a whopping 40.4 million for SPY.  Why is SPY so much more popular? Simply because of inception date and time to accumulate customers and popularity.  2010 for VOO, and a well seasoned 1993 for SPY.

wallstreetbets,Nov,1gqgoec,"Texas Roadhouse is next, heres why. ","So I've been watching Texas Roadhouse since June of this year. Why? Well, my wife and I love to go and eat here, and we noticed an interesting trend. No matter if we were in Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina, or anywhere else, Texas Roadhouse is literally packed from opening (which is around 4:30 PM most days) to 10 PM (I think) most nights. When I mean packed, people will be parking on the grass and everywhere.     Seeing this, it made me start thinking, ""Is this a traded company?"" The answer? Yes. So I began to look at the fundamentals of cash, debt, profit, and more.     They have no debt, $200 million +/- in cash, a quarterly gross of around 16% +/-, nearly $7 million +/- in revenue per store, opening 30 new locations, and they also own Bubba's 33s and Jaggers (never been there because we don't have any near us). They were also up on net income by 33%, revenue by 13%, and up between 13-30% +/- on everything else.     Go to Texas Roadhouse on any day of the week and see how busy they are. If they keep growing, making more money, and keeping their prices low (which they are notoriously cheap compared to anywhere else if you want a steak), I would not doubt if they acquire other businesses and grow to a $50 billion market cap.     A competitor, which is Darden, is only a $19 billion +/- market cap, $200 million +/- in cash, but $1.3 billion +/- in long-term debt, and only $5.3 million +/- in per store revenue.",Calls on cinnamon butter bread,"Never forget the bed bath and beyond guy, legend sat outside counting how many people went in, nobody has ever done such thorough DD",All my Spirit Airline flights were always packed ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271),"Some regard on WSB did similar ""I see this place often and it is always busy"" DD on Bath &amp; Body Works earlier this year.

About a year ago I dumped about 5k into a company that I may or may not have had private knowledge of.

Fast forward a couple months and my position was eliminated and I have been searching for jobs but been unemployed ever since. That 5k was a big chunk of my savings and with being unemployed and having bills to pay I quickly ran out of cash. I racked up about 12,000 in credit card debt and needed money fast.   So naturally, I started gambling. I gambled by using this same credit card on some sketchy online casino, I didn‚Äôt deposit much at once, usually only $100 or so, but man I realized I had a gambling addiction once I spent over 4k on this site. I was making the money back but then I was chasing my losses and lost it all.   Then autopay resumed on my card and tried to charge my entire balance which I didn‚Äôt have and Amex canceled my card. I was still making my monthly payments before that.   So now I‚Äôm 16k in debt on this card, 3k on another, and have about $100 to my name.

The average playbook for an ""world"" corp: Executives map out a high level plan without any relevant or executable details then turn it over to territorial and incompetent directors, usually with a finance background, who don't know their ass from a hole in the wall about any topic other than cost control. These directors then regurgitate the executive speak, usually with more bullshit words, and turn over execution to upper management, who are even more tribal, to come up with actual details they don't care to know. These upper managers consult with operations managers and select high performers on how to actually accomplish what the executives want then spend 100's of hours trying to nail down the logistics between departments that are actively hostile toward each other. In the end it's the workers who will execute and then get laid off during a cost cutting drive when the plan doesn't results in double digit percentage profits two weeks after beginning.",What do they mean by ‚ÄúReturn to Work‚Äù ?

wallstreetbets,Dec,1hihxyp,"The sheer idiocy of bitcoin and why this is it's last ""cycle""","Bitcoin, a glorified ponz, is fueled by the greater fool theory. Or rather the idea that no matter how irrationally overpriced an asset becomes, there will always be a bigger idiot willing to pay more. Why is this a problem now? Every cycle, the same playbook repeats: euphoric hype, mass speculation, and inevitable collapse. With each crash, more and MORE people are financially butt f*cked.  Each cycle draws in a greater percentage of the population and we've hit critical mass at this point. There aren't an infinite amount of people, our populations are shrinking, and at this point everyone in the world knows about bitcoin. Unlike gold, which has intrinsic material value, Bitcoin is a PURELY a speculative illusion. It produces nothing, generates no cash flow, and uses massive amounts of energy to solve hash functions that serve no purpose except to ""mine"" fake coins. It's actually unbelievably how regarded this is. This is not innovation ‚Äî it‚Äôs financial predation larping as ""muh technological progress""  As more of the global population gains exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs deceptive promise, the scale of economic harm increases. It is no longer a fringe hobby for tech enthusiasts ‚Äî it‚Äôs a financial hazard that is now too big to ignore. We are approaching a saturation point where enough of the population has been screwed over that I think bitcoin is on it's last dying breath.  I know this is a meme. I know people have called for the ""death of bitcoin"" and been wrong every single time over the past 14 years. But what was different between the past and now?  The difference is that there's nowhere for bitcoin to expand anymore. The bitcoin world is running out of greater fools. The average american's net worth is like negative $3000 dollars.   1.1% of the WORLD has more than 1 million dollars in assets. 12% of the world has between $100k and $1 million in assets. How many more people do you think can afford bitcoin?  At let's just say everyone adopts bitcoin. Original holders wouldn't just become trillionaires, they would become QUADRILLIONAIRES. The top holders of bitcoin would become the richest people IN ALL OF MANKIND. They would be worth more than all the saudi families, rothschild banking clans, etc COMBINED.  Does that seem like a bright future to you? Does that seem like it's ""liberating finance"" for the average person? No, it's fucking stupid and it's never going to happen. If it does happen, the CIA and all the elite people of the world will work together to ban bitcoin and assassinate all the fat nerds who hold it.  Also, bitcoin itself is outdated. If you know anything about it, it's clunky and subject to many kinds of attacks such as majority mining clusters, etc. It's actually NOT that safe and will become less so the more it's manipulated. Also quantum computing is coming, and while banks and other important institutions have already begun quantum proofing their data stores (Chase is leading the way), an attack on bitcoin will come out of nowhere and it will be vicious. Many people will lose EVERYTHING.  And before you call me salty, I own 4 bitcoin.

wallstreetbets,Dec,1hctd54,Why $MSTR is a piece of shit stock and you're a dumbass for investing in it: A presentation.,"Let me start off by clarifying something: MSTR was originally one of the companies that blew the fuck up during the .com bubble in 2000, they committed accounting fraud among other things, and their CEO that is STILL THEIR EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, Saylor, was accused of tax evasion and fraud by the SEC. Him and the whole company settled for a few million dollars, they later sold all of the business ventures they took on during the .com bubble because they were dogshit, etc. Clearly this is a guy and Microstrategy is a company that you should trust with your life savings.  Anyways, back to the point.      if you don‚Äôt know how intelligent leverage works, it‚Äôs basically MSTR‚Äôs financing strategy that allows them to build up a fuck ton of bitcoin, and what it is, is basically just paying out debt in a pre-agreed number of MSTR shares instead of actual money. They also cover some debt through fixed income to not overdilute their (worthless anyway lol) stock, but most of the payments are made through shares.  Say you have a public company with 1000 shares valued at one dollar. You raise $10 in convertible debt, print out 10 shares that dilute the existing share count by 1%, and use the $10 to buy 1 bitcoin. Say you already had 1 bitcoin ($10) in assets under management before, now you have 2 bitcoin. So you‚Äôve had a 100% increase in AUM and a 1% increase in share count.  So, for this hypothetical company, if you owned one share, you owned 1% of 1 bitcoin before the convertible debt financing, and after that, your one share translates to 20/1010\*100= 1.98% of 1 bitcoin. A nearly 100% increase in asset value per share.  What you can figure out as a very logical conclusion, though, is that the person who is financing $10 to your company so that you can buy 1 bitcoin could quite literally just buy 1 bitcoin outright on their own because they already have enough capital. 100% of a bitcoin. Instead, their 10$ now gives them 1.98% of a bitcoin, which means they lose a fuck ton of money.  The reason people keep investing, though, is that the people who owned the original 1000 shares nearly doubled their asset value per share, so they made a lot of money. And if another person invests, the person who just financed your company through convertible debt will also double their asset value per share, and they too will make a lot of money. The last person who invests is always gonna be worse off, though, because they‚Äôre losing a ton of value by investing in your company instead of just buying bitcoin, *but*, if you keep issuing more equity and taking on more convertible debt, everyone is gonna make money and be happy, right? Except, you have to keep increasing the amount of debt you take on and equity you give out exponentially to keep the people who invested happy, and at the point where no one else is left willing to invest, **everything** is gonna crash so violently it‚Äôs gonna go straight to fucking 0. ¬†  So now, hypotheticals aside, why is MSTR specifically a massive Ponzi scheme? Because convertible debt is a pretty legit thing and this is *totally* just a hypothetical scenario, no?  Let‚Äôs do the math for MSTR, starting with excerpt 1, a pic from their Q3 earnings report quantifying the ‚ÄúImpact of Intelligent Leverage‚Äù. Lmao.  [Excerpt 1](https://preview.redd.it/9xvtqqb0yg6e1.png?width=1481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d7a37ca95081ba0f483c9eff5a6fad21dc47740)  On the 31^(st) of December 2023, MSTR had 189,150 bitcoin; 30^(th) of September 2024 MSTR had 252,220 bitcoin. 31^(st) of December 2023 MSTR share count was 20,764,000, 30^(th) September 2024, MSTR share count was 23,510,000.  So in 2023, one share amounted to 189,150/207,640,000 \* 100 = 0.091%¬†of a bitcoin, and in 2024 one share amounted to 252,220/23,510,000 \* 100 = 0.107%¬†of a bitcoin.  However, on 9/30/2024, one bitcoin was worth $90,852.88 and one share of MSTR was worth $340.65. On 12/31/2023 one bitcoin was $42,265.19 and one share of MSTR was worth $63.19. So, if you spent $42,265.19, the price of one bitcoin, in MSTR stock in December 2023, you could buy around 670 shares which translates to owning around 61% of a bitcoin. That‚Äôs a terrible deal.  *Except* MSTR stock is now 8x the price because more (regarded) people invested and your shares now amount to around 71.7% of a bitcoin, so you got a great deal!  If you invested on 9/30/2024, when bitcoin was worth $90,852.88, and one share of MSTR was $340.65, you got around 267 shares, which gave you around 28.6% of a bitcoin, an even more terrible deal! The reason why that is, is that MSTR needs more and more financing to make investing attractive and keep making it worthwhile to buy into convertible debt, and, for the people that finance *that*‚Ä¶ Well, for them to make money, MSTR needs to finance even *more* convertible debt!  I swear there was a name for that ‚Äúbusiness model‚Äù‚Ä¶  In that same quarterly earnings report, MSTR revealed that they plan to increase their capital raising target by $4,000,000,000 every year in order to be able to achieve that financing (which is very optimistic btw), so that they can grow their existing bitcoin pool and increase the bitcoin / share of all their existing investors, at the cost of the people financing. But *those* people can be ok because MSTR will raise money from even more investors! Crazy right? Now if you rotate that image from their report by 90 degrees, believe it or not, it almost kind of looks like a pyramid! So crazy. Buy MSTR guys!!!! It‚Äôs gonna make my short position so much more money when everything crashes and burns.

I‚Äôm sure that gives their stock a lot of its value, right?  Except for the part where their software business is losing 340 million dollars. A FUCKING QUARTER.  Fuck MSTR.
