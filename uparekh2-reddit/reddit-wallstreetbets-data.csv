wallstreetbets,Jan,1935frs,Is it insider trading if I bought Boeing puts while I am inside the wrecked airplane?,"Purely hypothetical of cause:  Imagine sitting in an airplane when suddenly the fucking door blows out.   Now, while everyone is screaming and grasping for air, you instead turn on your noise-cancelling head-phones to ignore that crying baby next to you, calmly open your robin-hood app (or whatever broker you prefer, idc), and load up on Boeing puts.   There is no way the market couldve already priced that in, it is literally just happening.  Would that be considered insider trading? I mean you are literally inside that wreck of an airplane...  On the other hand, one could argue that you are also outside the airplane, given that the door just blew off...

wallstreetbets,Jan,1aeusk8,If I got a telescope and looked at the Federal Reserves monitors. Is it illegal to trade off the data I find?,,"just stay outside, then  it's all just outsider trading",Fuck I‚Äôm in the office. I‚Äôll apply to become a window washer.,Do what the big traders do: program an AI/algorithm to do it and if you're caught you can blame it on a software glitch.,"That's called ""due diligence,"" and ot is aparently encouraged.

wallstreetbets,Jan,18zrhs3,Boeing is so Screwed,Alaska air incident on a new 737 max is going to get the whole fleet grounded. No fatalities.,"Ya fr. This airplane is brand new, manufacture completed in November 2023!",Idk how they keep fucking up their airworthiness of their planes so frequently- an absolute joke,"Lmao another article says they are asking for an exemption from a rule on a smaller plane. Where ‚Äúif pilot forgets to turn of an anti-icing system , the engine will break apart‚Äù.",The American greed episode is also great. TLDR: they gave up the company culture of the best engineering for shareholder profits. The reason the 737-800MAX had so many incidents was they removed the back up sensors to save money. Lol,There‚Äôs a documentary on Netflix.,Alaska AA glad to know it is still under warranty--,"More specifically, Boeing used to be an excellent engineering driven firm.

He has considered/Will be moving the company to Texas.board of directors will be able to approve a new package ( I'm guessing the 25% ) as Elon decides.Today's after hours dump is about to turn to some great news for shareholders.,"Imagine the presentation to the board:‚ÄúTwitter poll of approximately 30k internet strangers, of whom maybe 1% of have any clue what the business and legal implications of this would be, voted in favor of this decision.

Which is fukin lame.  At least in CA ppl can purchase straight from Tesla and circumvent the good-for-nothing auto dealers who add nothing of value other than mark ups. Fk auto dealerships.
