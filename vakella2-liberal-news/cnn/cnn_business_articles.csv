Fox News and right-wing media have already decided the Trump trial verdict,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.



New York
CNN
         — 
    


            The jury might still be deliberating, but Donald Trump’s media allies have already delivered a verdict to their audiences.
    

            Throughout the duration of the Manhattan hush-money trial, Fox News and the rest of MAGA Media have set the stage to absolve Trump in the historic case. Day after day, week after week, popular personalities such as Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Steve Bannon have lampooned the judicial system, portraying Trump as an innocent victim of political persecution.
    

            Inside this alternate media universe, the actual facts of the case never penetrate the bubble that shields its audiences from detrimental developments for Trump. Instead, alternate dishonest storylines are disseminated as the gospel truth.
    

            Not only is Trump entirely innocent of any and all wrongdoing in the MAGA Media world, but President Joe Biden is guilty of nefariously weaponizing government to wage “lawfare” on his political opponent. Audiences are told that Biden cannot win a fair fight with Trump, so he has resorted to illegal “election interference” by rigging the judicial system against Trump.

            It goes without saying that these narratives are built on foundations of lies and innuendo that do not hold water. Biden does not control the judicial system. The hush-money case is taking place in New York state court with charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney. And it isn’t Trump’s left-wing enemies who have been making headlines testifying against the GOP candidate in the case, it’s his former allies, such as one-time fixer Michael Cohen and former National Enquirer boss David Pecker.
    

            Nevertheless, millions consuming right-wing media have been fed these deceptive storylines, impacting how voters perceive current events and, more importantly, cast their ballots. In the Republican Party, voters absorb their information from outlets like Fox News, which has dishonestly run defense for Trump over the course of the trial.
    

            “WHERE’S THE CRIME?” demanded a banner on Ingraham’s prime time show Wednesday along with a graphic showing images of Biden, Judge Juan Merchan, and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg “THE REAL FRAUDS.”
    

            In the following hour, Jesse Watters accused Merchan in an on-screen graphic of “LEADING THE JURY” and intimated how “very fishy” it was that a “stop Trump” judge was selected to preside over the case.
    

            The progressive Media Matters said in a study published this week that Fox News has leveled at least 200 attacks on Merchan alone since the trial commenced — a staggering number that does not include the attacks on others associated with the case. And the study only accounted for Fox News, not the host of other entities that make up the right-wing media universe.
    

            It can be tempting to ignore the torrent of attacks Trump’s media allies are launching in their unrelenting efforts to undermine the case. But those forces are shaping how a large swath of the country understands the high-stakes and unprecedented trial taking place in lower Manhattan. And they’re a reminder that if Trump were to return to power, he has a powerful propaganda apparatus at his disposal that will do everything in its power to sanitize his actions — whatever they may be.","Updated

"At a 2024 consumer electronics show, AI gets companies on the same page","CNN
         — 
    


            Companies big and small showed off new AI-powered products and their AI-inspired visions for the future at the world’s biggest tech convention this week in Las Vegas.
    

            There were pillows that can reduce snoring, mirrors that can detect your mood and innovations from pet-like companions to cars that integrate with viral chatbot ChatGPT.
    

            But this year’s announcements hit differently from previous buzzy developments, such as the Metaverse or adding voice assistant technology to appliances. That’s because nearly every company appeared to be on the same page in 2024.
    

            “It was an almost unanimous tethering to the AI theme … because it has infinite possibilities and a wide range of applications,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst at market research firm Forrester.
    

            Previous themes had “limited universal appeal,” he added.
    

            Although CES is a hotbed for dealmaking among executives, manufacturers and retailers across various industries, it can also set the stage for some of the biggest tech trends of the year and shine a spotlight on how companies intend to be part of those conversations.
    

            This year, non-tech companies including Walmart and L’Oreal held keynote presentations to discuss their AI visions for the future, which largely included adding generative AI solutions to help customers better find the products they want.
    

            At the same time, Amazon gave updates on how some of its developers are integrating similar technology with their Alexa voice assistant. Even some automakers, such as Volkswagen, said they will be adding the viral chatbot ChatGPT to their lineups of cars later this year to help drivers control GPS, the infotainment system and options like heating and cooling, as well as to get answers to general questions.
    

            “[These announcements] demonstrated how companies are first prioritizing customer needs and then figuring out how technology can best serve them,” Chatterjee said. “That’s a far cry from exhibiting cool tech in search of a use case.”

            It’s also part of a larger shift happening at CES, from technology powering experiences to experiences powered by technology. To help further that change, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD unveiled new processors that will help run the next-generation of AI products.
    

            Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at market research firm IDC, agreed the chatter around CES felt unique this year as companies had a general understanding of “how ubiquitous and seamless AI will be in the coming years.”
    

            “While many use cases are still unknown, what we do know is that no one wants to be left behind, so they’re starting to invest even before the products and use cases are fully fleshed out,” he said.
    

            Beyond AI, other products stood out, too. Samsung wowed onlookers with the world’s first transparent MicroLED screen, which looks much like a floating sheet of glass. EssilorLuxottica showed off a prototype of its Nuance Audio eyeglasses that also feature built-in hearing aids. And Sony teased a mixed reality headset that can be controlled with a smart ring.
    

            But considering CES 2024 was the first large-scale tech convention since the surge around AI last year, Eric Abbruzzese — a director at market research firm ABI Research — said “it’s no surprise AI was everywhere.”
    

            He expects AI to dominate the tech world conversation not only throughout the rest of the year but beyond.
    

            One caveat, however, is how the AI space will adapt to potential regulations, as government bodies and the White House aim to address the rapidly evolving technology.
    

            “Should a regulation tamp down on AI growth in the name of privacy, security or if a big negative news event ties back to AI, then companies will work to shift messaging away – at least somewhat – from AI,” Abbruzzese said. “Even if their product is still using AI, the ultra-focused AI marketing may diminish.”","Published

Boeing won’t even consider moving HQ back to Seattle,"New York
CNN
         — 
    


            It’s been a brutal six years for Boeing, with two fatal jet crashes kicking off a series of safety crises — and raising concerns about the quality and safety of the planes rolling off its assembly lines.
    

            As Boeing scrambles to repair its reputation, some critics and shareholders are asking: Why not move headquarters away from the shadow of Washington, D.C., ﻿and back home to its roots in Seattle?
    

            But Boeing has now made clear: We are not interested.
    

            An individual Boeing stockholder, Walter Ryan, wanted to put the question of a move up for a vote during the company’s May 17 annual shareholder meeting. He filed his proposal in October for the shareholder vote, which would have been non-binding — but in February, Boeing went to the Securities and Exchange Commission, ultimately winning approval to block the vote.
    

            Ryan, who owns 10,000 shares of Boeing stock, lives in Las Vegas and has never been to Seattle. But he believes that if Boeing is to fix its current quality and safety problems, the company’s top management should be back in Seattle — near where most of its commercial aircraft are still manufactured.
    

            “I think they need some hands-on overseeing, and by som﻿ebody who has skin in the game,” Ryan told CNN.

Boeing was once known for safety and engineering. But critics say an emphasis on profits changed that




            Boeing’s corporate offices had been in Seattle from its founding in 1916 until it relocated to Chicago in 2001.﻿ Then in 2022, Boeing corporate moved again — this time to Arlington, Virginia, near the Pentagon and across the river from Capitol Hill. Most manufacturing, however, remains more than 2,300 miles away in Seattle.
    

            “They want to be next to government,” Ryan said. “Is that a sound idea? I don’t think so.”
    

            It isn’t only shareholders like Ryan who believe a return to Seattle would benefit Boeing.
    

            “Part of it would be symbolic,” said Shem Malmquist, a Boeing 777 pilot and instructor of aviation safety at Florida Tech. “But it’s also going to be better culturally. In the end, the closer the top management is to the production and what’s going on and the engineers, the better.”
    

        Boeing’s response


            In his proposal he wanted presented to shareholders, Ryan said the corporate move from Seattle and separation from the core manufacturing business resulted in major issues related to “engineering and quality problems, and Boeing’s historic credibility,” — concerns he said are now foremost “in the minds of both travelers and shareholders.”
    

            Ryan wrote the proposal even before a headline-grabbing incident in January, when the door panel of a Boeing 737 Max blew off in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight, later found to be because the aircraft left the factory missing crucial bolts needed to keep it in place.
    

            Boeing’s attorneys argued to the SEC that this isn’t an appropriate issue for shareholder vote: “The proposal seeks to ‘micro-manage’ the company by probing too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.”
    

            Further, Boeing’s attorneys dismissed the premise of Ryan’s argument, calling it “an unsupported theory that certain manufacturing issues experienced by Boeing would have been avoided simply because the company’s headquarters were located in a particular city, emphasizing, among other things, management’s ability to walk the factory floor.”
    

            The SEC agreed that Boeing it did not need to put Ryan’s proposal on its proxy statement, which was released Friday. Boeing told CNN it did not have any comment beyond those included in its filing to the agency.
    

            Ryan said he believes his proposal — which would have allowed shareholders only to “recommend” a move back to Seattle, not mandate it — would have won had it been put up for a vote.
    

            “That’s why I sent it in. I thought it would pass, and thought it would be a good idea,” he told CNN.
    

            Speaking broadly, however, even shareholder proposals that are put to a vote are not likely to pass — especially recently.
    

            According to Institutional Shareholder Services, which tracks shareholder votes, only 5.4% of votes held in 2023 on shareholder proposals received majority support. That’s down sharply from 12.6% in 2022, and 19.5% in 2021.","Published

Two Apple employees sue over alleged gender discrimination in pay,"New York
CNN
         — 
    


            Two female employees at Apple sued the company on Thursday, alleging the company paid women less than men for the same work.
    

            The women are proposing a class action, seeking to represent more than 12,000 current and former female employees in the engineering, marketing and AppleCare divisions.
    

            Apple is not the first major tech company to face legal challenges for alleged gender discrimination. Google in 2018 agreed to pay $118 million to settle a class action gender discrimination lawsuit, and Oracle agreed to pay $25 million to settle a class action alleging underpaying female employees. Neither company admitted wrongdoing.
    

            The lawsuit centers on Apple’s hiring practices and performance evaluations, which the women allege pushed a wage gap between men and women.
    

            California made it illegal for employers to ask job candidates about their prior pay in 2018. Instead, since January 2018, Apple asked about pay expectations, the lawsuit says.
    

            The lawsuit alleges that Apple used the pay expectation information to set starting salaries, which had lower pay rates for women compared to men who did similar work.
    

            The lawsuit also claims that the performance evaluations are biased against women, because parameters such as teamwork and leadership tend to reward men and punish women. This can affect women’s promotions and bonuses, the lawsuit alleged.
    

            Justina Jong, a customer and technical training instructor and one of two plaintiffs, said in a release from her attorneys that she noticed a W-2 left on the office printer by a male colleague.
    

            “I noticed that he was being paid almost $10,000 more than me, even though we performed substantially similar work. This revelation made me feel terrible,” Jong said in a statement.
    

            The lawsuit also alleges that Jong was forced to work in a hostile work environment next to a co-worker who had sexually harassed her.
    

            The other plaintiff, Amina Salgado, said she complained to Apple numerous times about the wage gap, according to the lawsuit. Salgado has worked in several roles for Apple since 2012, according to the suit. Eventually, she said, Apple hired a third-party firm to conduct an investigation, which found that she was paid less.
    

            “As a result of the third-party investigation, in late 2023, Apple increased Ms. Salgado’s compensation prospectively, but failed and refused to pay Ms. Salgado back pay for the years during which she was paid less than men performing substantially similar work,” the lawsuit alleged.
    

            The lawsuit claims the class members are entitled to compensation from the loss of fair wages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.
    

            Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Published

            Days after the Iowa Hawkeyes set the all-time ratings record for a women’s college basketball game in their Elite Eight win over the Louisiana State University Tigers, the team set yet another record.
    

            The Hawkeyes’ 71-69 victory on Friday over the UConn Huskies in the Final Four averaged 14.2 million viewers, making it the most-viewed women’s basketball game and the largest viewership for an ESPN basketball broadcast, according to the sports network.
    

            Friday’s game peaked at 17 million viewers, making it ESPN’s second-best non-football telecast ever.

            Monday’s Elite Eight matchup saw more than 12 million viewers tune in to watch the much-hyped rematch of 2023’s women’s national championship game, which saw Iowa avenge last year’s loss and advance to its second straight Final Four.
    

            The audience for that game peaked at 16.1 million viewers, according to ESPN.
    

            The average women’s NCAA tournament game’s viewership rating is up by 127% year over year for ESPN, according to Disney, the sports network’s parent company, CNN previously reported.

This little robot is helping sick children attend school,"CNN
         — 
    


            When children are chronically ill and unable to attend school, it’s not just the illness that can be debilitating — the separation from the classroom and friends can also take a toll.
    

            For young people undergoing long-term treatment or struggling with mental health issues, Norwegian company No Isolation developed the AV1 robot, which can take a child’s place in class, serving as their eyes, ears, and voice, and helping them stay connected with their classmates.
    

            The AV1 looks like a blank, simplified version of a human head and torso. It can rotate 360 degrees and is fitted with a camera, microphone and speaker. Teachers place it on a classroom desk and the student controls it remotely using an app, for which they are given a unique password.
    

            “They can tap or swipe their finger around the screen to look at different corners of the classroom,” said Florence Salisbury, marketing director for No Isolation. The student can talk to the teacher or their classmates through the speaker, and the app has a “raise hand” option that makes a light flash on the robot’s head. They can also select emojis that display in the robot’s eyes.
    

            Salisbury says there are 3,000 active AV1 units in 17 countries, mostly in the UK and Germany, both of which have over 1,000 of the robots in operation.
    

            In the UK, schools can rent the AV1 for around £150 ($200) per month, or opt for a one-time purchase for £3,700 (just under $4,960), with an additional service package of £780 (around $1,045) annually.

            Salisbury says that perhaps the robot’s biggest benefit is its ability to maintain social bonds. She shared the story of a 15-year-old student in Warwickshire, England, using AV1  whose friends take the robot to lunch with them, keeping him included in their social circle.
    

            “During a long absence, where classmates might not see their friend for an extended period, this connection to school really becomes a lifeline for that student, especially for those with a medical condition,” Salisbury said.
    

            According to the most recent government statistics, more than 19% of students in England were persistently absent from school in the autumn of 2023/24, 7.8% due to illness alone, which is higher than pre-pandemic levels.
    

            During the Covid pandemic, remote learning became the norm, but as students returned to school, for many it’s no longer an option. AV1 was launched before the pandemic, but some schools have reported using the robots to help students who have struggled to reintegrate with the classroom environment.
    

        “They make the child important”


            The UK’s Chartwell Cancer Trust has a supply of 25 AV1 robots it provides to children with serious illness. Founding trustee Michael Douglas told CNN that the robots enable children to stay engaged with their education even while in intensive care. “They are loved by the parents and make a real difference,” he said. “They make the child important.”
    

            But he acknowledged that there can be administrative challenges around their use and that “red tape can be a real issue” when trying to get the AV1 system into schools or hospitals.


            He added that some schools may also struggle to maintain the necessary technical infrastructure for seamless operation, because of weak Wi-Fi or mobile signal dark spots.

        Technical training


            In June, research published in the peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Digital Health, examining the use of the AV1 in Germany and of the OriHime avatar robot in Japan, found the technologies “bear high potential for children to stay socially and educationally connected.”
    

            However, it added that there was a need to establish structures to give equal access to avatar technologies, and that training sessions for teachers on the technical and social aspects of the robots are important for successful implementation.
    

            Last August, No Isolation rolled out AV1 Academy, a library of training materials and resources aimed at improving the usability of the robot.
    

            According to Salisbury, the AV1 is designed with robust privacy features. No personal data is collected, and the app prevents screenshots or recordings. Encryption secures the livestream, and only one device can connect at a time, with the robot’s head and eyes lighting up to signal active use.
    

            There are other avatar robots on the market and some, like VGo and Buddy, have wheels and can move around the school or workplace, while some have a screen that shows the user’s face. Salisbury said that not having wheels is more practical for AV1, and weighing around 1 kilogram, the robot is easy for teachers or students to move between classes in a bespoke backpack.
    

            She added that the absence of a screen showing the child’s face can also be an advantage. “Removing that pressure to be on camera, we’ve seen, increases the likelihood of the robot being used for students with emotionally based school avoidance,” Salisbury said.","Published

"These millions of Americans are more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed and have no family support","Washington
CNN
         — 
    


            Quinn Merriss, an 18-year-old who identifies as transgender and non-binary, barely makes ends meet.
    

            Merriss was kicked out of their home after years of tension and arguments with their parents over being transgender. They now live independently without any financial support from relatives, working as a server earning $5.50 an hour plus tips.
    

            “I’m living paycheck to paycheck,” Merriss, who lives in an apartment in Cincinnati, told CNN. They manage to scrape by thanks to a housing assistance program, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
    

            Merriss’ plight illustrates the harsh economic realities of millions of Americans who identify as transgender and/or non-binary. The evidence from research and surveys is unmistakable: People whose gender identity does not match their sex at birth are more likely to experience financial hardships than the general population. (Some transgender people identify as “non-binary,” which means they don’t conform to one particular gender.)
    

            They deal with “lower employment rates, lower household incomes, higher rates of poverty, greater public assistance use, and increased likelihood of food insecurity,” a 2022 study found. There are at least 5.3 million individuals who identify as transgender and/or non-binary in the United States, about the size of the Phoenix metropolitan area, according to the Pew Research Center.
    

            In interviews with CNN, economists, researchers and transgender people themselves say “transphobia,” or negative beliefs and attitudes about trans people, is to blame. Transitioning genders can also cost tens of thousands of dollars, and being in the closet is well documented to take a toll on mental health.

        What the statistics show


            The dire economic straits of transgender and non-binary people hasn’t been explored for very long, though much has been uncovered in recent decades.
    

            “We know that transgender people have been experiencing so many economic disparities ever since there has been data collected on them, going back 30 or 40 years,” said Kevin Nadal, a distinguished professor of psychology at City University of New York’s Graduate Center.
    

            “If you see a trans person and they make you feel uncomfortable, that’s because you either haven’t been exposed to them much before or because you have very rigid ideas about gender,” Nadal said. Pew has also found that most Americans believe that a person’s gender is determined by their sex at birth, but favor protecting them from discrimination.
    

            The United States Transgender Survey, conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, is releasing full results from “an unprecedented” 92,329 respondents later this year, its latest iteration since the previous survey in 2015. A preliminary analysis showed that living and working conditions remain as tough as ever.
    

            More than a third of transgender people surveyed (34%) said they were experiencing poverty, and 30% said they’ve been homeless at least once in their lives. The unemployment rate among the transgender people surveyed was 18%, more than four times the current national rate.


The Census Bureau puts the poverty line for a single person at $14,880 in 2022, the year of the survey.
    

        The pivotal role of family support


            A person’s family plays a crucial role in their financial health, economists say, even with something as simple as providing shelter in adolescence or early adulthood. That safety net is often non-existent for transgender people.
    

            “It’s a lot about how you start out in life,” said Jody Herman, senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. “We’ve found that trans people who had been kicked out of their homes or had family rejection experiences were more likely to be in an unstable economic position.”

            Jay Woodman, a 29-year-old transgender man, fled his immediate family in Greenville, South Carolina, about six years ago with his partner, Alexander Taylor. The couple is currently living with Taylor’s parents in southern Maryland. Woodman said he has “no contact” with any of his relatives after it became clear they don’t support his gender identity.
    

            “Unless you have financial help in some way from parents, grandparents or friends, forget about buying a house in this area,” Woodman said. “(Alexander) and I were even priced out of a trailer community with how bad our financial situation was a few short years ago, when he was a full time office assistant and music instructor and I worked a part-time minimum wage food service job because it was all I could get at the time.”
    

            The US housing market has been notoriously tough for years, with rents rising faster than incomes and home prices recently soaring to a record high as mortgage rates remain painfully elevated. First-time buyers often receive financial assistance from family to purchase a home, according to a realtor.com survey.


            Many parents also help pay for higher education. Research shows that’s simply not the case for most transgender and non-binary people. Merriss said they dream of attending college but have put that on hold to work full time.
    

        Disrespect while on the job is par for the course


            Sarah Elizabeth Isbell, 62, began to transition from male to female in 2000, eventually getting gender reassignment surgery in 2008. Isbell currently works in an administrative support role at a nonprofit organization, but she holds a law degree from the University of Oklahoma.
    

            Isbell said she worked at a civil rights law firm in the late 2000s, after she already began to transition, but got fired shortly after a humiliating incident at the workplace.
    

            “I showed up to work one day wearing sandals with my toes painted red and I got ridiculed by the boss, a female boss, in front of the whole office at lunch,” Isbell said. “She said ‘Would you go to court that way?’ and when I said that I don’t see an issue… She just let into me relentlessly about how men can’t dress like that.”

            “That was really mortifying,” she added. Isbell said she has struggled to find another job as a lawyer.
    

            “I did civil rights law. But after my transition, even my civll rights lawyer friends didn’t want to hire me. I kept being told that juries and clients with cases in front of juries won’t accept a transgender trial lawyer,” she said.
    

            in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark civil rights case that employers are prohibited from discriminating against LGBTQ employees. The case before the nation’s highest court, Bostock v. Clayton County, was a consolidation of three similar cases around the country. One of them was brought by Aimee Stephens, who came out as a transgender woman in 2013 while working as a funeral director in a suburb near Detroit. She informed her employer in a letter that she would be coming in dressed as a woman and was fired shortly after, which led to Stephens’ lawsuit. Stephens passed away a month before the Supreme Court’s decision.
    

            “Trans folks have been protected (at the workplace) under federal law for four years now, but it’s not clear how well that’s working,” Michael Martell, an economics professor at Bard College, told CNN. “Trans people face stigma throughout their lives, so it’s certainly fair to say that labor market discrimination is a contributing factor to their disadvantages in life.”
    

            The early report of the US Transgender Survey showed that 11% of respondents said they had been fired, forced to resign or been laid off because of their gender identity or expression.
    

            And transgender people say they still deal with disrespect while on the job. A common issue for transgender people is being misgendered, or referred to with terms that don’t reflect their chosen gender identity, which is sometimes done by accident and other times purposefully. Merriss, Woodman and Isbell all said they’ve been misgendered at the workplace.
    

        A wave of anti-transgender bills across states


            A historic wave of bills in state legislatures across the nation aims to ban access to gender-affirming health care for transgender youth and regulate curricula in public schools, including discussions on gender identity.
    

            Last year, there were at least 510 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced by lawmakers in various states, most of them controlled by Republicans, according to American Civil Liberties Union data. That set a record and was nearly three times the number of similar bills introduced in 2022. More than two-thirds of the 167 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced last year related to health care were aimed at blocking trans minors from getting gender-affirming care.
    

            According to Trans Legislation Tracker, 40 anti-trans state bills have so far been signed into law this year, in addition to eight that have been passed by lawmakers but haven’t been approved or vetoed by a governor yet.
    

            Despite the economic struggles and hostile political landscape across the country, researchers and transgender people say that being your authentic self is invaluable. An overwhelming 94% of respondents in the latest US Transgender Survey said they “reported that they were either ‘a lot more satisfied’ or ‘a little more satisfied’ with their life” after transitioning genders.
    

            “It’s awful some days, but I would not give up being this way,” Merriss said. “I’ve gotten away from the family toxic environment, and it’s been so helpful seeing celebrities and characters in media being portrayed positively as a trans person.”","Published

Young Uzbeks are finding new markets for traditional handicrafts online,"CNN
         — 
    


            For centuries, the nomadic tribes of Central Asia used colorful textiles called suzanis as seating, prayer mats, bedding and dividers in their yurts – the traditional tents that were their homes. Women would pass the skill down to younger family members, and the textiles, woven with symbols representing luck and fertility, would be presented to the groom as part of a bride’s dowry.
    

            The tradition continues today. Twenty-four-year-old Aziza Tojiyeva, who lives in a small village about 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside of Bukhara, Uzbekistan, learned how to embroider from her mother, Mukhabbat Kuchkarova, who learned from her own grandmother. “I grew up in an embroidery family,” said Tojiyeva, “When I was a tiny girl, I was interested in doing this work.”
    

            Tojiyeva is the first generation to sell the creations online, on Etsy, Instagram and eBay – using digital technology to give a centuries-old craft tradition a bright future. Each week she sells two or three items, from throw pillows to bedspreads, on Etsy – plus a few more on other platforms. Most of her orders come from the US, but she has customers in places like Spain, Italy and the UK.

            Online sales only represent about 2% of retail sales in Uzbekistan, compared to about 25% in the US and more than 30% in China, according to accounting firm KPMG. Most craftspeople in Uzbekistan – from knifemakers to carpet weavers – haven’t yet gone digital. But entrepreneurs like Tojiyeva demonstrate how young people from traditional backgrounds are starting to leverage technology to reach overseas markets.
    

            “The younger generation … they know how to use digital media, and they’re helping their parents or grandparents show their products to the to the world,” said Dr. Indira Alibayeva, a postdoctoral researcher at Kazakhstan’s Nazarbayev University’s Research Centre for Entrepreneurship (NURCE). Alibayeva worked on a book, “Roots of Heritage: Honoring Hunarmandchilik Tradition in Uzbekistan,” about craftspeople in Uzbekistan, which includes a chapter on Tojiyeva.
    

        Economic evolution


            During the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of tourists visiting Bukhara, a site popular for its Silk Road heritage, plummeted and Tojiyeva wanted to help her family find a new source of income. After doing some online research, she set up on Etsy and other platforms.
    

            The journey of their family’s business is closely linked with the country’s economic evolution.
    

            Uzbekistan came under Russian control in the 19th century, and traditional Uzbek craftsmanship almost didn’t survive the Soviet era. Craftspeople, from suzanis and carpet makers to potters, had to work in factories to play their parts in the planned economic machine, said Professor Shumaila Yousafzai, the director of NURCE, who also worked on the book.
    

            Still, people continued with their crafts. “Uzbek identity is all about being an artisan. No matter what trade you do, you do something with your hands as well,” said Yousafzai.

            After the country declared independence in 1991, handicrafts enjoyed a revival, and many turned their hobbies into income. In 2000, Tojiyeva’s parents decided to start an embroidery business, and began selling their wares in the local bazaar.
    

            Today, the average monthly salary in Uzbekistan is less than $400. Its president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, is championing reforms to reduce state control over the economy and promote private sector activity, boost its per capita GDP and reduce poverty. Wide-ranging efforts include trying to attract tourists, investing in an expansion of its capital city, and supporting industries from startups to handicrafts with tax breaks and other incentives.
    

            The liberalization of the foreign exchange market in 2017 allowed entrepreneurs to receive money from overseas online sales into an Uzbek bank account, Muzaffar Azamov, the chairman of the E-Commerce Association of Uzbekistan, told CNN via email.
    

        From yurt seating to upscale interior design


            Suzanis are experiencing a resurgence, in Uzbekistan and overseas. Fashionable Uzbeks wear clothing made from the fabric, and suzanis have become popular with interior designers from the UK to Singapore, who use them as wall décor, bedding, or as the fabric for throw pillows. Yousafzai said she thinks that’s because Uzbekistan has grown in popularity as a tourist destination.
    

            In addition to Etsy, Instagram and eBay, Tojiyeva’s family also sells goods to tourists visiting a museum they set up at their home to show off their sewing techniques.
    

            She said that she has regular online customers in places like the US who re-sell her items in their homeware stores, adding that at least some of them found her from her posts on Pinterest – whose “mood boards” are a favorite of interior design enthusiasts – where she does her marketing.
    

            On Tojiyeva’s Etsy page, throw pillows fetch about $90. A pillow might take 10 to 15 days to complete; an embroider can only work for about two hours a day, otherwise it might hurt her eyes and fingers, she said. Larger items, like an intricate tapestry, might command more than $600.
    

            Tojiyeva isn’t alone. Others in the country have taken to online platforms to sell items like robe-like garments called chapans and Gijduvan ceramics, a craft that began in Bukhara in the 3rd century AD. There are efforts to get more sellers online; early adopters have taught others, and eBay has a Central Asia Hub which highlights products from the region, an initiative supported by USAID and other development agencies.
    

            E-commerce could help reduce poverty, improve social mobility and create employment opportunities for millions of citizens, said Azamov. Since the purchasing power of the Uzbek population is relatively low, foreign markets could play an important role, he added.
    

            Tojiyeva says her mother is impressed with the uptick in sales. The family business now works with a network of about 200 women from local villages to keep up with demand from their orders, she says.
    

            But for Tojiyeva, it’s more than a business. “It’s like meditation when you sew. You forget about everything else,” she says. “And when you sew something beautiful, you feel satisfaction.”","Updated

Netflix’s ad-based plan hits 23 million active monthly users,"New York

         — 
    


            Netflix’s ad-supported tier has hit more than 23 million monthly active users, Amy Reinhard, the streaming service’s president of advertising, said Wednesday.
    

            That’s about an 8 million increase in roughly two months; the streaming giant announced it had 15 million global monthly active users in November 2023.
    

            “We’re very fortunate to be able to take a long-term perspective on this,” Reinhard said at the Variety Entertainment Summit at the consumer tech conference CES. Variety first reported the Netflix figure.
    

            “Scaling our business is absolutely our biggest priority right now, but we want to make sure we’re doing that in a meaningful way for the members,” she said.
    

            In an October 2023 letter to shareholders, Netflix said its ads plan membership grew almost 70% quarter-over-quarter and that about a third of its new signups were ad-based in the countries that had the service.
    

            “We remain very optimistic about our long run opportunity in this very big market,” Netflix said in the letter.
    

            Netflix launched its ad-based plan in the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain and the UK in 2022. The standard plan with ads costs $6.99 a month in the US.
    

            Netflix runs 10, 20 and 60 second ads, the company said in a November release.","Published

Aviation experts raise questions about 737 Max ‘door plug’ design,"CNN
         — 
    


            In the aftermath of last week’s Alaska Airlines in-flight emergency, some aviation experts are questioning the structural design of the section of the Boeing 737 Max 9 that blew off the plane.
    

            On that January 5 flight, a “door plug” – a portion of the plane’s fuselage the manufacturer can put in place instead of an emergency exit door – detached from the plane and was later discovered in an Oregon backyard.
    

            In interviews with CNN, some experts argued that if that door plug were designed to be larger than the opening it covers and installed inside the plane, the force of the pressurized air in the passenger cabin would force the plug against the plane’s interior frame and a situation such as the one on the Alaska Airlines flight could have been avoided. However, such a design could have added costs and practical disadvantages, some said.
    

            “It doesn’t make sense to me why they would do it that way and not have it installed from the inside, where it literally cannot come out unless there is a structural failure in the airframe,” said David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector and CNN analyst. “Historically, since we have had pressurized airplanes, emergency exits are designed to come inward… so why would they have not done the same thing with this plug?”
    

            Soucie said the design of the door plug on the Max 9 may provide some advantages, such as making the plane more readily accessible for maintenance.
    

            Robert Ditchey, an aviation consultant, agreed that if the plug were designed to be larger than the hole in the fuselage and installed inside the cabin, this incident likely would not have happened.
    

            “It should have been installed from the inside to the outside, not the other way around,” Ditchey said of the plug, adding that the exterior installation raises the prospect that the bolts used to secure the plug could have failed.
    

            “You could have missing bolts,” he said. “They could have had the wrong bolts, or they could have over-torqued the bolts thereby breaking them, or not torqued them enough.”
    

            John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that while a different design could theoretically prevent a problem like this from happening, he described this design as adequate so long as proper installation and quality controls are followed.
    

            “Could you design a plug door for this airplane that would prevent it from going out, the answer is yes you could. It just is going to cost you money and time,” he said. “Was this design adequate is the real question, and if it was installed properly, we wouldn’t be talking about it.”
    

            “There really is not a big issue with having this door in there, if it was secured right,” Goglia said.
    

            A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on the door-plug design, citing an active investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. In a staff-wide meeting Tuesday, Boeing’s CEO attributed the incident to a “mistake,” which he did not identify. A company source told CNN that Boeing believes “the mistake in question” was introduced in the aircraft’s manufacturing supply chain.
    

            Boeing CEO David Calhoun told CNBC in an interview that aired Wednesday that he is “confident” in the Federal Aviation Administration’s ongoing work with airlines to “inspect each and every one of the airplanes” and make “certain that they’re in conformance with our design, which is a proven design.”
    

            Federal investigators have determined the components that may have been involved in the door plug coming loose, but they have not yet determined why it blew out, CNN reported Monday. The door plug is typically held in place by stop fittings and has a set of bolts that prevent the door from moving and potentially flying off the plane. Somehow, the plug on the Alaska Airlines flight moved, NTSB’s Clint Crookshanks explained at a news conference Monday night.
    

            The FAA on Saturday ordered most Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be temporarily grounded as the cause of the incident is investigated. The order applies to about 171 planes.
    

            Former Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo, a CNN analyst, said door plugs have long been used in aviation and, in addition to the Max 9, have been used on planes converted to freighters. But she also questioned this particular design.
    

            She said this door plug used on some Max 9s is “designed not to be one of these wedge-doors, that when pressurized it can’t be opened … it’s a door that has to be opened from the outside during some inspections.”
    

            “That’s the part of the design that to me seems flawed,” Schiavo said.
    

            Schiavo said she thinks Friday’s incident will lead to additional door-plug inspection protocols for airlines.
    

            Separately, a federal lawsuit filed last year by investors in Spirit AeroSystems – the supplier that makes the fuselage of Boeing’s 737 Max jets – accused the company of “widespread and sustained quality failures” in its products.
    

            The suit states that quality failures, which have allegedly ranged from debris in products to missing fasteners and peeling paint, led Boeing to place Spirit on probation from around 2018 to at least 2021. The suit, which was previously reported by the publication The Lever, does not specifically mention door plugs.
    

            The suit claims that “constant quality failures resulted in part from Spirit’s culture which prioritized production numbers and short-term financial outcomes over product quality, and Spirit’s related failure to hire sufficient personnel to deliver quality products at the rates demanded by Spirit and its customers including Boeing.”
    

            The suit further states that a former Spirit AeroSystems employee who worked as a quality manager and inspector and who was not named in the suit wrote an ethics complaint to the company in 2022 that described an “excessive amount of defects” in products. The former employee believes “Spirit treats moving products down the line as more important than quality,” according to the suit.
    

            A spokesperson for Spirit AeroSystems, Joe Buccino, said in a statement that “Spirit strongly disagrees with the assertions made by plaintiffs in the amended complaint and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Spirit will not comment further as to the pending litigation.”
    

            A Boeing spokesperson declined comment on that suit.
    

            In April, Spirit AeroSystems identified a production issue on the aft fuselage section of certain 737 models. “This is not an immediate safety of flight issue. We have processes in place to address these of types of production issues upon identification, which we are following,” the company then said in a statement.
    

            In August, the company disclosed improper holes drilled on the “aft pressure bulkhead” on some models of the 737 fuselage. Both Spirit and Boeing said in statements that the issue was determined not to be an immediate flight-safety concern.
    

            In December, Boeing asked airlines to inspect their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after a potential problem was discovered. Boeing said a plane with a missing bolt was fixed but wanted all Max planes in service checked.
    

            Boeing has faced scrutiny since two fatal crashes involving 737 Max 8’s– one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019 – that killed 346 people. A safety system called MCAS used in those planes was linked to both crashes.","Updated

"‘In so many ways, I broke so many barriers:’ Former Pepsi boss Indra Nooyi on life as a trailblazing CEO","Greenwich, Connecticut
CNN
         — 
    


            Turning a food giant like PepsiCo — whose portfolio includes Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade and Mountain Dew — away from fat, sugar and salt might sound like a recipe for disaster.
    

            And yet that is exactly what Indra Nooyi did when she was the company’s CEO, from 2006 to 2018. During her tenure, net revenue grew more than 80%.
    

            “In the life of a CEO, every day is a challenge,” she tells CNN in her office in Greenwich, Connecticut. “Boards pick CEOs because they’re resilient, they can actually find a way through all of these challenges and transform the company. And that’s what I had to do. I had to make sure our portfolio was shifting to a good blend of ‘treat for you’ products, ‘fun for you’ products, and then add the ‘better for you’ and ‘good for you’ products.
    

            “I had to reduce the environmental footprint. I had to make sure people felt charged and excited to come to work for PepsiCo while delivering performance. That was the single biggest challenge.”
    

            Nooyi was born in Madras (today Chennai), India, and emigrated to the United States in 1978 to study at the Yale School of Management, where she also worked as a receptionist to sustain herself. She joined Pepsi in 1994, aged 39, and served as its president and chief financial officer before becoming CEO — a role that made her the first woman of color and first immigrant to lead a Fortune 50 company.

            “I just looked at the assignment and said, Oh my God, I better do right by women, by people of color, by immigrants, by people of Indian origin,” she says. “I wanted to do right by everybody, but most importantly, I wanted to make sure I was a good steward of PepsiCo. And so at that point, I didn’t think of the historic role that I was playing.
    

            “In retrospect, though, I’m realizing now it was very frame breaking. And in so many ways, I broke so many barriers,” she adds.
    

        Happy retirement


            Fortune magazine named Nooyi number one on its annual Most Powerful Women in business ranking from 2006 through 2010, and Forbes magazine included her on the list of The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women from 2008 through 2017, her last full year at Pepsi.

            “When I decided to retire, I was exhausted and I had lots of successes,” she says. “I had been on the job for 12 years, 12 great years, and I actually thought I’d miss PepsiCo a lot. (But) the next day I was a new person and I never missed my old job. Even for a minute.
    

            “I miss some of the people, but not the job, because I had so many things I could do here. Things that ranged from interesting boards to nonprofits to working on issues that always interested me.”
    

            Since early 2019, she has been a member of the board of directors at Amazon. She is also a member of the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum and an honorary co-chair for the World Justice Project, an organization that works to advance the rule of law worldwide.

            Nooyi is widely regarded as a visionary in American business history, and says her own definition of the word is “somebody who sees the future but makes change today towards that future.”
    

            But getting there wasn’t easy, and sometimes came at the expense of her own work-life balance, a topic she explored deeply in “My Life in Full,” her memoir, published in 2021. “I worked incredibly hard. This was not a job that just came to me,” she says. “I earned it. I put the company before me. I put the company before me at every point in time. Whatever I did, I wanted to make sure it made a difference for the company.”
    

        Lasting legacy


            Looking back, she points to her parents as her initial source of empowerment and inspiration. “My parents allowed me to do wild things like climb trees and fall down and play in a rock band — so everything that a traditional woman in India didn’t do,” she says. “So in many ways, as I always say, I won the lottery of life.”

            Married to businessman Raj K. Nooyi since 1981, they live in Connecticut with their two daughters, and a serious collection of guitars. “Many of these guitars are ones that I owned, but when musicians performed for a PepsiCo halftime show or for a concert, our team would give them one of my guitars and say, Could you sign it?,” says Nooyi, who played guitar in a rock band during her college years in India.
    

            “There’s Blake Shelton and Usher. There’s Lionel Richie, Don Felder (formerly of The Eagles). I don’t play them anymore because I just don’t have the time. But I look at them and I think back to all of those halftime show performances or where I met these artists and I live this life where I go, I cannot believe I met Blake Shelton.”
    






In 2021, Nooyi was inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame at Ben Bridge Jeweler in Seattle, Washington.

            Asked about her lasting legacy, she points at the young people she mentored at Pepsi who are now in leading roles in the corporate world. “People remember you for not just your business contributions, they also remember you for the people you developed, nurtured, mentored,” she says.

Digital humans: the relatable face of artificial intelligence?,"London
CNN
         — 
    


            Scrolling through the Instagram account of DJ and aspiring model Dex you’ll see her wearing new outfits, performing at shows around the world and chatting to her thousands of followers about her hobbies.
    

            However, it’s clear that there is something different about Dex; she’s an entirely virtual “digital human,” designed by a startup in the UK.
    

            For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine — a 3D modeling software widely used in video games — combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI.
    

            “She’s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,” says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. “You can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.”
    

            Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events.
    

            For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she’s a “showpiece” for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can “listen” to people’s questions and converse in real time. “Shellie” can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while “Arif” is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports.
    

            According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. “What we’ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,” Sims tells CNN. “It becomes natural.”

        AI explosion


            Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI — artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way.
    

            Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human.

            US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational “digital humans” that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways’ website and app.
    

            Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market. 


            “When we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?” asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. “In some ways, we think of AI as something that’s helping us or augmenting our work,” she says. “However, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.”
    

            Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. “Every scenario that we found, we’re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,” she says.
    

            “Digital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,” adds Sims. “We’ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.”","Published

‘My job is to worry’: Google DeepMind COO Lila Ibrahim on the responsibility of building AI,"London
CNN
         — 
    


            Lila Ibrahim’s first love is not computers. Somewhat surprisingly for the first ever COO of Google DeepMind, it’s not even artificial intelligence, nor is it coding.
    

            Ibrahim’s first love is engineering, and it’s that background, she says, that makes her so valuable at a job that’s all about computing.
    

            “I became an [electrical] engineer because I thought it was a combination of math, art and science. And along the way, I actually really enjoyed working with people. And what I’ve enjoyed about my engineering career is the ability to bring all of that together and bring a unique view into everything that I do,” Ibrahim told CNN’s Anna Stewart during a recent interview at Google DeepMind headquarters in London.
    

            “Being an engineer has taught me to ask the question of what, why, and what are we trying to achieve? So that if you can really understand a problem, you can figure out what the right solution is rather than just throw a bunch of solutions at an undefined problem.”
    

            As professional problem-solver, part of her job “is to worry,” Ibrahim said. “What are the risks, and how do we mitigate them? And also to think about the opportunities, and how do we support them? … I feel like I had almost a moral calling to be in this role and all of a sudden, my very weird, circuitous background kind of makes sense with where I’m sitting right now.”
    

            One thing she has learned, Ibrahim said, is that she’s not very good at predicting the future: “But I’m very good at building it.”

        Thinking from the outside-in


            Growing up as the daughter of immigrants, with English as her second language, Ibrahim said she often felt “like an outsider” throughout her childhood and into adulthood, first in the American Midwest, then as an exchange student in Japan, and into university at Purdue, in Indiana, where she studied electrical engineering.
    

            “There weren’t that many women,” Ibrahim recalled. “In fact, you could count them on a couple of fingers at the time.”
    

            By then, she added, in her early twenties, “I was so used to having to get comfortable with bringing a different perspective into everything.”

            While that “outsider” mentality initially felt like a hurdle, Ibrahim says the biggest lesson she’s learned is to accept it as a superpower – and wishes she’d done so sooner.
    

            She built her career, first at computer chipmaker Intel, then at a venture capitalist firm. Ibrahim went on to become the first president and COO for online learning platform Coursera.
    

            In 2018, a fascinating opportunity crossed her desk: DeepMind, an artificial intelligence research lab founded in 2010, which Google acquired in 2014, was looking for its first COO.

            “Thirty years into my career, I really wanted to be very deliberate and intentional on what this next chapter would be,” Ibrahim said.
    

            “But when you have a chance to work on such transformative technology … how do you say no? So I actually engaged in the conversations, but very slowly and intentionally. I wanted to understand, what were the founders’ vision for what I could make possible, and what were the risks?”
    

            In total, Ibrahim says she spent 50 hours interviewing for the position, as she weighed the prospect of entering the exciting but often controversial world of AI.
    

            “I’d go home and I would tuck my daughters in at night saying, ‘what kind of legacy will I leave in the world?’ At the end of the day … I felt there was no better place to build AI responsibly than DeepMind,” she said.
    

        A Nobel-winning idea


            Ibrahim’s love of engineering was inspired by her Lebanese father, who was orphaned by the time he was five years old and would grow up to become an electrical engineer.
    

            “I remember [when I was] growing up, he would have these beautiful drawings on his desk at home,” Ibrahim said. “And then I would see these pictures turn into microchips that would go into things like heart pacemakers. So this orphaned kid from Lebanon would actually have been able to save people’s lives through his work on pacemakers, all through engineering.”

            Motivated by her father’s example, Ibrahim views her work in terms of impact. At Google DeepMind, perhaps the most important example is AlphaFold, the company’s AI program capable of solving what it calls the protein prediction problem.
    

            “A protein is a basic building block of life,” Ibrahim explained. “And if we can understand how a protein might fold, we can understand the function that it has and when it misfolds, what’s gone wrong. And so things like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s – these are all protein-related problems.”
    

            What would normally take a human researcher years for just a single protein now happens in minutes. The company also made AlphaFold open-source, meaning any researcher anywhere in the world can access it (over 2 million people in 190 countries and counting, according to Google DeepMind). In October, two of Ibrahim’s colleagues were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the program.
    

            “We were not expecting [the Nobel Prize],” Ibrahim said, “definitely not in this year,” noting AlphaFold is only four years old.
    

            “AlphaFold is just the first step,” she added. “We have a portfolio of research that’s happening not just in biology but in chemistry, in physics, and so much more.”

        “Pioneers end up with arrows in their back”


            It hasn’t always been easy, Ibrahim says; even with AlphaFold, there were periods when they weren’t sure it would ever work.
    

            But she pointed to a time earlier in her career, while at Intel, that was most “transformational” for her. After she had her “hand slapped” while working on a challenging project, then-CEO and chairman Craig Barrett, whom Ibrahim counts among her most valuable mentors, told her, “’Pioneers end up with arrows in their back. You’re paving a path forward. Stop occasionally. Let me pull the arrows out, so you can run further and faster.’”

            Now, Ibrahim says, she’s in the position to remove arrows from the back of her team, while still taking a few of her own, in an attempt “to give folks the space to do what’s right.”
    

            While Ibrahim says she’s benefited from her mentors – which, she pointed out, were all men – she hopes the time soon comes when she and other women in tech no longer feel like outsiders.
    

            “I certainly hope that my daughters and their generation push the bounds of what it means to be an engineer, a scientist, well beyond what my generation was able to accomplish,” Ibrahim said.
    

            “I also feel like it’s my responsibility now in this role, at this time in history, to make sure that I am not just bringing women along,” she added, “but thinking about bringing others along, whether it’s gender, geographic diversity, ethnic diversity – because I think to have the impact in society that we need to have, we need the diverse voices in from the beginning.”","Published

Retailers use police-like investigation centers to fight theft. Shoppers pay the price,"CNN
         — 
    


            When SWAT officers swarmed a house in a sleepy San Jose, California neighborhood last month, they found what could best be described as a make-shift hardware store inside: Shelves lined with boxes of brand-new tools, bathroom fixtures and spools of industrial wiring.
    

            It resembled a mini Home Depot. And in some ways, it was.
    

            Much of the cache of products—worth about $150,000—had been stolen from real Home Depot stores. The retail chain’s internal security force spent months investigating the thefts, scanning security camera footage, tracking license plates and surveilling suspects. They connected dots of the criminal network allegedly responsible and shared their findings with the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, which executed search warrants and arrested the suspects.
    

            Increasingly, this is how it goes today for retailers trying to battle theft and fraud by organized crime rings. A CNN review of court records and interviews with more than two dozen retail and law enforcement officials shows that persistent problems with sophisticated organized crime networks have led many private-sector companies to not only assist law enforcement but to often deliver the bulk of the evidence that leads to criminal prosecutions.
    

            Anyone who has shopped at retail stores in recent years has encountered everyday products like laundry detergent, medication and beauty supplies locked up behind metal gates or plexiglass. Retailers say those in-store security measures are emblematic of the ongoing threat of organized retail crime, which typically involves groups of low-level thieves who steal items for middlemen who in turn sell to unsuspecting customers hunting for deals on marketplaces such as Amazon or eBay.
    

            Efforts to counter this crime, however, have come with some costs. Security investments can translate into higher prices for consumers, and civil liberties advocates argue the surveillance technology used by retailers can infringe on individuals’ privacy.
    

            While retailers have long partnered with law enforcement, the industry has bolstered its role in recent years, devoting more staff and financial resources to thwarting theft. Some retailers are researching body-worn cameras for employees. Others, including Home Depot, have invested in police-like investigation centers to sift through data and pinpoint theft-group members.

            “A lot of times, local and state resources don’t have the capacity to investigate these crimes at that scale,” said Sean Browne, senior manager of asset protection for Home Depot. Browne said Home Depot, which has nearly tripled its investigative team since 2016,  has started using license-plate readers in some store parking lots. “We try to full-service the investigations and ensure we cut off the head of the snake.”
    

            Where law enforcement agencies sometimes face jurisdictional limits to their investigations, retailers can track cases across state and county lines with increasingly sophisticated tools – such as artificial intelligence that identifies patterns – and choose agencies with which to share cases.
    

            “Retailers themselves are really taking the ball and running with it and then partnering with law enforcement at all levels,” said David Johnston, vice president of asset protection for the National Retail Federation (NRF), a top lobbying group for the retail industry. NRF surveys of retailers last year found that more than half reported budget increases to combat organized retail crime.
    

            Precise national data on organized retail crime is lacking. Last year, NRF even retracted a claim in one of its reports related to the scale of the crime, which led critics to charge that the industry had exaggerated the issue to achieve policy goals or justify store closures caused by underperformance.
    

            Still, most retailers insist they have seen an uptick in organized theft. About 90% of asset-protection professionals surveyed last year by NRF said the crime had become more of a risk over the prior three years.
    

            “These investments wouldn’t be made for no reason,” said Browne of Home Depot, which has also added security to stores like locks, gates, cameras and other tech to deter theft. “Unfortunately, this creates an environment for our customers that isn’t very friendly,” he said.

        A complex crime


            The industry’s push to crack down on organized retail crime comes amidst differing policies and law enforcement priorities across the nation. Some states have focused on tackling such theft, with more than a dozen launching organized retail crime taskforces, which collaborate with private companies and police.
    

            Investigators for the attorney general of Washington state, which created an organized retail crime unit last year, specifically credited businesses Target and Ulta Beauty for gathering much of the evidence behind two felony cases, according to probable-cause affidavits. That material included loss prevention reports, security footage and photographs.
    

            In the case involving Ulta Beauty, a company investigator identified the defendant and accomplices who allegedly stole products across six counties, according to an affidavit.
    

            “We can’t bring the cases without them,” Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said when asked by CNN about the role of retailers. “Everything you’re seeing in those probable-cause statements is what you would see in case after case after case as we go forward with this work.”
    

            Ferguson said organized retail crime cases are inherently complex to investigate and prosecute, especially for local agencies with limited resources, so public-private partnerships are a necessity.
    

            That was evident in the case of Linda Ann Been, an Oklahoma woman sentenced to more than five years in prison earlier this month for managing an organized theft ring that federal prosecutors say stole about $9 million in property from retailers.
    

            The case largely began with an investigator for CVS who noticed a trend of thefts at his company’s stores in the Tulsa area, according to a state affidavit. He then used records to link low-level thieves who physically robbed the stores with Been and shared his findings with a local detective.
    

            The investigation later revealed how Been had provided the thieves with lists of items to steal from businesses across multiple states. The items were organized at a warehouse and boutique clothing shop in a suburb of Tulsa and sold by Been to other sellers – known as “fences” – outside of Oklahoma who in turn sold the products through websites, including eBay and Amazon, to customers, documents show.
    

            In a brief interview with CNN prior to her sentencing, Been questioned why those higher-level fences to whom she sold products appear not to have faced consequences. “How come … nothing happened to those people?” she asked.
    

            In her guilty plea in 2022, Been specifically named one such fence to whom she “frequently sent stolen inventory” as a man named Baruch “Butch” Treff.
    

            Treff, in an interview with CNN, acknowledged buying products from Been, whom he said other vendors had recommended, but insisted he had no idea she had traded in stolen goods.
    

            “If I knew I would never have bought from her. I don’t deal with stolen goods,” Treff said. An attorney for Treff, Yosef Jacobovitch, added that his client did due diligence and met with Been to try to ensure she was a legitimate vendor. “She fooled him and others,” Jacobovitch said.
    

            A government investigator familiar with the case, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said one of the challenges of such cases is determining whether higher-level fences knowingly purchased stolen goods for resale.
    

            The case against Been’s organization involved a range of state and federal authorities including Homeland Security Investigations and the IRS, but during a news conference, a federal prosecutor credited retail-industry investigators for contributing and called such collaborations a “force multiplier.”
    

            Aside from supplying evidence, retailers sometimes identify broader trends of groups moving from city to city before law enforcement, said Sgt. Patrick Flynn of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s organized retail crime unit, which launched last year.
    

            Patrick Walsh, an organized-retail-crime manager for grocery chain Kroger, said his company has heavily invested not only in its investigative capacity but also visual deterrents. For example, the company purchased an old police car to drive around parking lots to ward off would-be criminals.
    

            Some companies’ efforts have backfired. In December, drugstore chain Rite Aid agreed to a five-year ban on facial recognition technology after the Federal Trade Commission found that the company’s use of the tech led to false shoplifting allegations against customers – especially people of color – who appeared to match entries in a company watchlist. A Rite Aid spokesperson said the company is enhancing its information-security practices and policies.
    

            The way retailers have collected evidence for police with such tech has alarmed privacy-rights advocates.
    

            “Police are public entities. You can send them a public records request. You can elect a mayor who may want to change the police department. You cannot do that with a giant corporation. You have very little control over what technology they deploy, how they deploy it and then what they do with that data,” said Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.
    

        Calls for more federal action


            The threat of organized retail crime and pressure from the industry has led some officials to call on the federal government to do more.
    

            Over the last year much of that push has centered on a federal bill, the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act, that would create an intelligence-sharing hub at the Department of Homeland Security and broaden the scope of applicable criminal conduct.
    

            San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, a Republican-turned-independent who expressed support for those changes at a congressional hearing in December, referred to limited coordination between law enforcement and retailers and laws that apply relatively light penalties for habitual thieves as “key challenges” in policing the issue.
    

            The bill has received criticism. A coalition of civil rights groups that included the ACLU and NAACP argued in a letter in March that the legislation promotes punitive policies that would disproportionately affect marginalized communities and exacerbate poverty by pushing more crime into the federal system. “This enforcement-first response, we don’t think that leads to crime deterrence,” Chloé White, an attorney with one of those groups, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, told CNN.

            The bill has garnered support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers, but it has not advanced.
    

            “Everything is stalled in Congress,” said Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat who helped introduce the legislation. Reacting to the way private retailers have been growing their internal investigative efforts, Titus said, “That’s the reason we need to do something at the federal level… I’m not trying to put down local law enforcement. I think they are doing the best they can with the resources they have.”
    

            Congress has taken some steps to help the retail industry. A law that took effect last year requires online marketplaces to verify and disclose information on large, third-party sellers, such as bank account numbers. The law in effect makes it harder to sell stolen products through the internet with impunity.
    

            But industry sources argue online platforms could do more to police organized retail crime on their sites.
    

            Specifically, those marketplaces should more proactively question high-volume sellers of discounted goods and “ask for proof that these goods have been acquired lawfully,” said Khris Hamlin, vice president of asset protection for the Retail Industry Leaders Association.
    

            Major online marketplaces say they have taken steps to combat such crime. Amazon touts a program that applies unique codes to certain products that can be used to detect and track stolen items. Mike Carson, eBay’s senior director of global policy, said eBay has safeguards including automated processes that flag irregularities among items for sale, which can prompt further investigation.
    

            Browne of Home Depot said he welcomes more assistance from online marketplaces and the federal government.
    

            “Crimes like drugs, human trafficking, they have major organizations going after this and rightfully so. Retail crimes have not gotten that same attention over the years,” he said. “It’s expanded beyond the bandwidth of local and sometimes even state law enforcement.”
